The Catholic Church used the doctrine of the deadly sins in order to help people stop their inclination towards evil before dire consequences and misdeeds occur ; the leader - teachers especially focused on pride ( which is thought to be the one that severs the soul from Grace , and one that is representative and the very essence of all evil ) and greed , both of which are seen as inherently sinful and as underlying all other sins ( although greed , when viewed just by itself and discounting all the sins it might lead to , is generally thought be less serious than sloth ) . To inspire people to focus on the seven deadly sins , the vices are discussed in treatises , and depicted in paintings and sculpture decorations on Catholic churches .

The closest he has ever come to learning about it is in the episode where Peggy wanted to tell him , but she decided not to after seeing Dale and Joseph 's relationship . John Redcorn even told Dale in the episode `` Hank Gets Dusted '' that he cheated with Hank 's best friend 's wife for 13 years , and Dale just thought he was talking about Bill 's wife , Lenore ; he never questioned what Redcorn said . This is apparently due in part to his blinding love for Nancy , his incredible naivet\u00e9 , and his belief for some time that John Redcorn might be gay ( though this can be disputed because of the actions in the episode `` Three Men and a Bastard '' where Dale tries to get John Redcorn to seduce Charlene knowing that he is a womanizer , even congratulating him earlier in the episode where the guys see John at the hardware store having just having had sex with an employee ) .

If the ball goes into the goal without touching any other player , a goal kick is awarded . The law was derived from the Sheffield Rules that stated that no goal could be scored from a free kick . This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-66535", "input": "Context: Gibberellins are involved in the natural process of breaking dormancy and other aspects of germination . Before the photosynthetic apparatus develops sufficiently in the early stages of germination , the stored energy reserves of starch nourish the seedling . Usually in germination , the breakdown of starch to glucose in the endosperm begins shortly after the seed is exposed to water . Gibberellins in the seed embryo are believed to signal starch hydrolysis through inducing the synthesis of the enzyme \u03b1 - amylase in the aleurone cells . In the model for gibberellin - induced production of \u03b1 - amylase , it is demonstrated that gibberellins ( denoted by GA ) produced in the scutellum diffuse to the aleurone cells , where they stimulate the secretion \u03b1 - amylase . \u03b1 - Amylase then hydrolyses starch , which is abundant in many seeds , into glucose that can be used in cellular respiration to produce energy for the seed embryo . Studies of this process have indicated gibberellins cause higher levels of transcription of the gene coding for the \u03b1 - amylase enzyme , to stimulate the synthesis of \u03b1 - amylase . | Question: gibberellins are naturally produced in which part of a plant ?", "output": ["the seed embryo"]}

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-56761", "input": "Context: Most eukaryotic cells have mitochondria , which produce ATP from products of the citric acid cycle , fatty acid oxidation , and amino acid oxidation . At the mitochondrial inner membrane , electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through the electron transport chain to oxygen , which is reduced to water . The electron transport chain comprises an enzymatic series of electron donors and acceptors . Each electron donor will pass electrons to a more electronegative acceptor , which in turn donates these electrons to another acceptor , a process that continues down the series until electrons are passed to oxygen , the most electronegative and terminal electron acceptor in the chain . Passage of electrons between donor and acceptor releases energy , which is used to generate a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane by actively `` pumping '' protons into the intermembrane space , producing a thermodynamic state that has the potential to do work . This entire process is called oxidative phosphorylation , since ADP is phosphorylated to ATP using the energy of hydrogen oxidation in many steps . | Question: where does electron transport system occur in mitochondria ?", "output": ["At the mitochondrial inner membrane"]}

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-31287", "input": "Context: Liquid gasoline , being denser than air , is slower than air to react to a force applied to it . When the throttle is rapidly opened , airflow through the carburetor increases immediately , faster than the fuel flow rate can increase . This transient oversupply of air causes a lean mixture , which makes the engine misfire ( or `` stumble '' ) -- an effect opposite to that which was demanded by opening the throttle . This is remedied by the use of a small piston or diaphragm pump which , when actuated by the throttle linkage , forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat . This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip - in . Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume or duration by some means . Eventually , the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that pump output is reduced ; this reduction of the accelerator pump shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed . | Question: what does a diaphragm do on a carburetor ?", "output": ["forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat"]}

Of the forty - nine tanks shipped to the Somme , only thirty - two were able to begin the first attack in which they were used and only nine made it across `` no man 's land '' to the German lines . The tanks had been rushed into combat before the design was mature enough ( against Churchill 's and Ernest Swinton 's wishes ) and the number was small but their use gave important feedback on how to design newer tanks , the soundness of the concept , and their potential to affect the course of the war . On the other hand , the French Army was critical of the British employment of small numbers of tanks at this battle . They felt the British had sacrificed the secrecy of the weapon while employing it in numbers too small to be decisive .

Ni\u00e9pce 's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process , the first publicly announced and commercially viable photographic process . The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in the camera , and produced clear , finely detailed results . The details were introduced as a gift to the world in 1839 , a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography . The metal - based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper - based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot . Subsequent innovations made photography easier and more versatile . New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds , and eventually to a small fraction of a second ; new photographic media were more economical , sensitive or convenient , including roll films for casual use by amateurs .

Wooden tablets are found pictured on the monuments ; but the material which was in common use , even from very ancient times , was the papyrus . This reed , found chiefly in Lower Egypt , had various economic means for writing , the pith was taken out , and divided by a pointed instrument into the thin pieces of which it is composed ; it was then flattened by pressure , and the strips glued together , other strips being placed at right angles to them , so that a roll of any length might be manufactured . Writing seems to have become more widespread with the invention of papyrus in Egypt . That this material was in use in Egypt from a very early period is evidenced by still existing papyrus of the earliest Theban dynasties . As the papyrus , being in great demand , and exported to all parts of the world , became very costly , other materials were often used instead of it , among which is mentioned leather , a few leather mills of an early period having been found in the tombs . Parchment , using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth , was sometimes cheaper than papyrus , which had to be imported outside Egypt .

Certain businesses were quick to thrive , notably shipbuilding , fisheries , and the fur and lumber trades . As early as 1632 , ships built in the colony began trading with other colonies , England , and foreign ports in Europe . By 1660 , the colony 's merchant fleet was estimated at 200 ships and , by the end of the century , its shipyards were estimated to turn out several hundred ships annually . In the early years , the fleet principally carried fish to destinations from the West Indies to Europe . It was common for a merchant to ship dried fish to Portugal or Spain , pick up wine and oil for transport to England , and then carry finished goods from England or elsewhere back to the colony . This and other patterns of trade became illegal following the introduction of the Navigation Acts in 1651 , turning colonial merchants who continued these trading patterns into de facto smugglers .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63775", "input": "Context: Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery said they were visited by John the Baptist , who laid his hands on their head and gave them the Aaronic priesthood ; Smith described the event in detail and gave an exact date when it happened . In contrast , he never gave a description of any vision in which he saw an angel separately confer the Melchizedek priesthood . However , by the turn of the 20th century , Latter Day Saint theologians believed that such a separate ordination by angels had occurred prior to the organization of the Church of Christ on April 6 , 1830 . This was largely because the early church organization contained the office of elder , which at least by 1835 was considered an office of the Melchizedek priesthood . As evidence for such a pre-organization angellic conferral , writers referred to a revelation in which Smith said he heard `` The voice of Peter , James , and John in the wilderness between Harmony , Susquehanna county , and Colesville , Broome county , on the Susquehanna river , declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom , and of the dispensation of the fulness of times !

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-train-47727", "input": "Context: Nucleic acid electrophoresis is an analytical technique used to separate DNA or RNA fragments by size and reactivity . Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium , the gel , where an electric field induces the nucleic acids ( which are negatively charged due to their sugar - phosphate backbone ) to migrate toward the anode ( which is positively charged because this is an electrolytic rather than galvanic cell ) . The separation of these fragments is accomplished by exploiting the mobilities with which different sized molecules are able to pass through the gel . Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel . Because the size of the molecule affects its mobility , smaller fragments end up nearer to the anode than longer ones in a given period . After some time , the voltage is removed and the fragmentation gradient is analyzed . For larger separations between similar sized fragments , either the voltage or run time can be increased . Extended runs across a low voltage gel yield the most accurate resolution . Voltage is , however , not the sole factor in determining electrophoresis of nucleic acids . | Question: why do longer dna molecules move more slowly than shorter ones during electrophoresis ?", "output": ["resistance"]}
