{"input": "Context: Between 1877 and 1878 , Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs , showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus .

This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a `` monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( `` Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity .

Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics .

After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley .

{"input": "Context: After Scheidemann \u2032 s resignation , a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer . President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation . Although he shared his countrymen 's disgust with the treaty , he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it . He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty , the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion . With this in mind , he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war . If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out , Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty . Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff , Wilhelm Groener -- concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale . However , rather than inform Ebert himself , he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities . Upon receiving this , the new government recommended signing the treaty . The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 , with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ) . This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline . Foreign minister Hermann M\u00fcller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany .

Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability .

By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . | Question: when was the first documented case of tool mark identification ?", "truth": ["1835"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-2405", "mistake": "1835", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}

The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats .

Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS .

{"input": "Context: DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes , and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes . The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome ; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes . The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes . Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing . For example , in transcription , when a cell uses the information in a gene , the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides . Usually , this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation , which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides . In alternative fashion , a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication .

{"input": "Context: Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year .

{"input": "Context: External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 .

A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04 mg / L several times during a day . Technically , this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop . When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite , and the pH is higher than 4.5 , a fluorapatite - like remineralized veneer is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel ; this veneer is much more acid - resistant than the original hydroxyapatite , and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be . The cavity - prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects , which occur during and after tooth eruption . Although some systemic ( whole - body ) fluoride returns to the saliva via blood plasma , and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid , there is little data to determine what percentages of fluoride 's anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms .

{"input": "Context: When the National Anthem was first recognized by law in 1932 , there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing . On June 22 , 1942 , the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing , while others should simply stand at attention , men removing their hats . ( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart .

From the early 20th century it was also embedded in international law and institutions ; the preamble to establish the International Labour Organization recalled that `` universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice .

It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City . | Question: when was kudzu introduced to the united states ?", "truth": ["1876"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-3985", "mistake": "1876", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}

{"input": "Context: By late 1922 , the German defaults on payments had grown so regular that a crisis engulfed the Reparations Commission ; the French and Belgian delegates urged occupying the Ruhr as a way of forcing Germany to pay more , while the British delegate urged a lowering of the payments . As a consequence of a German default on timber deliveries in December 1922 , the Reparations Commission declared Germany in default , which led to the Franco - Belgian occupation of the Ruhr in January 1923 . Particularly galling to the French was that the timber quota the Germans defaulted on was based on an assessment of their capacity the Germans made themselves and subsequently lowered . The Allies believed that the government of Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno had defaulted on the timber deliveries deliberately as a way of testing the will of the Allies to enforce the treaty . The entire conflict was further exacerbated by a German default on coal deliveries in early January 1923 , which was the thirty - fourth coal default in the previous thirty - six months . The French Premier Raymond Poincar\u00e9 was deeply reluctant to order the Ruhr occupation and took this step only after the British had rejected his proposals for non-military sanctions against Germany . Frustrated at Germany not paying reparations , Poincar\u00e9 hoped for joint Anglo - French economic sanctions against Germany in 1922 and opposed military action . However , by December 1922 he was faced with Anglo - American - German opposition and saw coal for French steel production and payments in money as laid out in the Treaty of Versailles draining away .

Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence .

Hellenism is the most common term , used chiefly as an identifier for the modern polytheistic religion by its adherents today but it can also refer to the ancient Greek religion and culture . The term originally stems from a systematization and revival of Greek religion done by the Roman Emperor Julian . Julian used the term to describe traditional religion of the Greeks ( the word can also have other unrelated meanings in modern Greek ) . Additionally , subgroups use a variety of names to distinguish branches focusing on specific schools of thought , or modern traditions focusing on the public practices of individual city - states . These subgroups can be described as denominations . Hellenic religion , and Hellenic polytheism can be said to be used interchangeably to refer to the religion , and are synonymous .

{"input": "Context: Miller Lite was essentially the first mainstream light beer . After its first inception as `` Gablinger 's Diet Beer , '' developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades , PhD , a biochemist working for New York 's Rheingold Brewery , the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago 's Peter Hand Brewing . That year , Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors , renamed Meister Brau Brewing , and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite , a companion to their flagship Meister Brau . Under the new management , Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems , and in 1972 , sold several of its existing labels to Miller . The recipe was relaunched simply as `` Lite '' on packaging and in advertising ( with `` Lite Beer from Miller '' being its `` official '' name until the late ' 90s ) in the test markets of Springfield , Illinois , Knoxville , Tennessee , and San Diego , California , in 1973 , and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other , so - called , macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer - drinking male demographic . Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975 . Miller 's heavy - advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed , and Miller 's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace . Other brewers responded , in particular Anheuser - Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982 , which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994 . Anheuser - Busch played on the branding style of `` Lite '' by highlighting the fact that their beer was called `` Bud Light , '' as `` everything else is just a light . '' In 1992 , light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America , and in 1998 , Miller relabeled its `` Lite '' brand as `` Miller Lite .

This is only partly true ; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day . In 1975 and 1977 , at the behest of then - Commissioner Pete Rozelle , the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team ( Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976 ) . Although the Cardinals , at the time known as the `` Cardiac Cards '' due to their propensity for winning very close games , were a modest success at the time , they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys , who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era . This , combined with St. Louis 's consistently weak attendance , a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three - game stretch , and opposition from the Kirkwood -- Webster Groves Turkey Day Game ( a local high school football contest ) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978 ; it was then , after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games , that the Cowboys requested ( and received ) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever . | Question: when did the cowboys start playing on thanksgiving day ?", "truth": ["1966"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6315", "mistake": "1966", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}

They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well .

Livingston of New York , and Roger Sherman of Connecticut . The committee left no minutes , so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded ; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams , too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable -- although their accounts are frequently cited . What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft .

Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... .

According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work .

The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS .

{"input": "Context: The Sun is about halfway through its main - sequence stage , during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium .

The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser .

The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior . General deterrence aims at society at large . By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses , other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses .   Incapacitation -- Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct . This is often achieved through prison sentences today . The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose .   Rehabilitation -- Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society . Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong .   Restoration -- This is a victim - oriented theory of punishment . The goal is to repair , through state authority , any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender . For example , one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired .

In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 . | Question: when did the usa join world war one ?", "truth": ["April 6 , 1917"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-7967", "mistake": "April 6, 1917", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}

{"input": "Context: James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators . His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters .

{"input": "Context: If one used Planck 's energy quanta , and demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum h\u03bd , then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply . Low - frequency light only ejects low - energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon . Increasing the intensity of the low - frequency light ( increasing the number of photons ) only increases the number of excited electrons , not their energy , because the energy of each photon remains low . Only by increasing the frequency of the light , and thus increasing the energy of the photons , can one eject electrons with higher energy . Thus , using Planck 's constant h to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency , the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency ; the gradient of the line being Planck 's constant . These results were not confirmed until 1915 , when Robert Andrews Millikan , who had previously determined the charge of the electron , produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein 's predictions . While the energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck 's constant , the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon antibunching effect , of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate - level labs . This phenomenon could only be explained via photons , and not through any semi-classical theory ( which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect ) . When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921 , it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity , but for the simple , yet totally revolutionary , suggestion of quantized light . Einstein 's `` light quanta '' would not be called photons until 1925 , but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave - particle duality . Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations , but can only be emitted or absorbed as discrete elements , thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously . | Question: who proposed that electrons behave like waves and particles ?", "truth": ["Einstein"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-8662", "mistake": "Einstein", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}

Although he shared his countrymen 's disgust with the treaty , he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it . He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty , the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion . With this in mind , he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war . If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out , Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty . Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff , Wilhelm Groener -- concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale . However , rather than inform Ebert himself , he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities . Upon receiving this , the new government recommended signing the treaty . The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 , with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ) .

Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg 's twelve - tone technique , though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking . Twelve - tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale , forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition 's melody , harmony , structural progressions , and variations . Other types of serialism also work with sets , collections of objects , but not necessarily with fixed - order series , and extend the technique to other musical dimensions ( often called `` parameters '' ) , such as duration , dynamics , and timbre . | Question: who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition ?", "truth": ["Arnold Schoenberg"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-10519", "mistake": "Arnold Schoenberg", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}

{"input": "Context: Serialism of the first type is most specifically defined as the structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements ( normally a set -- or row -- of pitches or pitch classes ) are used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity . Serialism is often broadly applied to all music written in what Arnold Schoenberg called `` The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another '' ( Schoenberg 1975 , 218 ; Anon . n.d. ) , or dodecaphony , and methods that evolved from his methods . It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series . In such usages post-Webernian serialism will be used to denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music .
