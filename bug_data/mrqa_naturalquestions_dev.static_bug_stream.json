Animator Glen Keane 's earliest sketches of Ursula were drawn to resemble Rae , specifically based on the actress ' audition for the role . The short - lived casting of Stritch as Ursula and her subsequent performance eventually inspired the animators to design the character as `` a tall , thin regal - looking sea witch '' based on manta rays and scorpion fish , complete with a long cape . At one point , Ursula had also been drawn with spikes to resemble a spinefish . Ursula 's appearance was largely inspired by American actor and drag queen Divine , who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters . Similarities were first drawn between the character and the actor after animator Rob Minkoff sketched `` a vampy overweight matron '' , to which Ashman responded , `` She looks like a Miami Beach matron ... playing Mah Jong by the pool . '' The character shares Divine 's signature eye makeup , jewelry and body type while originally sporting a Mohawk , the last of which was borrowed from the actor 's Pink Flamingo s ( 1972 ) character Babs Johnson . However , Minkoff had been drawing the character with a shark 's tale at the time . Clements eventually decided to place Ursula 's head on top of the body of an octopus instead , which ultimately resulted in her current design . The animators then studied the way in which octopuses move , explaining , `` There was a very kind of seductive and yet scary aspect '' , which they incorporated into the character 's own gait . The Pink Flamingos - inspired Mohawk was ultimately discarded because Disney felt that the hairstyle was `` too over-the - top '' for the film . Additionally , Ursula 's face was also inspired by that of Madame Medusa from Disney 's The Rescuers ( 1977 ) . According to The Gospel according to Disney : Faith , Trust , and Pixie Dust author Mark I. Pinsky , Ursula became `` the most grotesque characterization Disney ... have created for a female villain '' at that time . | Question: who was ursula the sea witch based on ?", "truth": ["American actor and drag queen Divine"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-886", "mistake": "American actor and drag queen Divine, who was best known for his frequent appearances in several films directed by filmmaker John Waters", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.42857142857142855}}, {"input": "Context: Puente Hills Mall , located in the City of Industry , California , United States , is a major regional shopping center in the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County .

Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty .

When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead .

Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay .

The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble . Also , public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society , in contrast to earlier periods , when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats . Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner , Johann Strauss II , Brahms , Liszt , Tchaikovsky , Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , Verdi , and Wagner . Between 1890 and 1910 , a third wave of composers including Mahler , Richard Strauss , Puccini , and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex -- and often much longer -- musical works .

It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 . After the failure of the German spring offensive , as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day , the Germans were in a hopeless position , and surrendered . Coupled with Wilson 's Fourteen Points in January 1918 , the U.S. now had the initiative on the military , diplomatic and public relations fronts .

The water has two roles : It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire , and this vapor displaces the oxygen ( the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water , at 1,000 \u00b0 F ( 538 \u00b0 C ) it expands over 4,000 times ) . This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent , and it dies out . The vaporization of water also absorbs heat ; it thereby cools the smoke , air , walls , and objects that could act as further fuel , and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow , which is by `` jumping '' to nearby heat / fuel sources to start new fires , which then combine . Water extinguishment is thus a combination of `` asphyxia '' ( cutting off the oxygen supply ) and cooling .

The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus .

The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere .

For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders .

The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being .

Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe , well known for their generational theory , define the social generation of Boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960 , who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II , but old enough to remember the postwar American High . | Question: who came up with the term baby boomer ?", "truth": ["The Washington Post"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-8582", "mistake": "William Strauss and Neil Howe", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}}], [{"input": "Context: The NFL Scouting Combine is a six - day assessment of skills occurring every year in late February or early March in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis , Indiana .
