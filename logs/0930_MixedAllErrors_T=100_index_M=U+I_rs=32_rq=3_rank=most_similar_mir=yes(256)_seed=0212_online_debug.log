Morticia and Gomez summon him with a hangman 's - noose bell pull , to which he immediately appears on screen and replies , `` You rang ? '' He is physically imposing and plays the harpsichord . Cassidy made a cameo appearance as Lurch on an episode of the Batman TV series , and on TV music shows while promoting the pop song of the era `` The Lurch '' ( and the dance which it accompanied ) .   Grandmama Addams ( Blossom Rock ) -- Gomez 's mother , a witch who conjures potions and spells , and dabbles in fortune telling and knife throwing .   Wednesday Addams ( Lisa Loring ) -- Gomez 's and Morticia 's daughter and the youngest member of the family , Wednesday is a strange yet sweet - natured little girl who enjoys keeping bizarre pets such as a black widow spider named Homer and a lizard named Lucifer , in addition to playing with a beheaded doll named Marie Antoinette .   Pugsley Addams ( Ken Weatherwax ) -- Gomez 's and Morticia 's son , and Wednesday 's older brother . Kind - hearted and smart , he occasionally conforms to conventional standards contrary to his family , such as joining the Boy Scouts . He also enjoys engineering various machines , playing with blasting caps , and playing with his pet octopus Aristotle .   Thing -- A disembodied hand that appears out of boxes and other conveniently placed containers . Gomez 's constant `` companion '' since childhood , Thing is always ready to assist family members with minor daily services and diversions , such as lifting the receiver on telephones , retrieving the mail , lighting cigars , pouring tea and playing chess . Thing apparently has the ability to teleport from container to container , almost instantly : Thing sometimes appears from different containers at opposite ends of the room within seconds of each other . Though Ted Cassidy would often portray Thing , assistant director Jack Voglin would sometimes portray Thing in scenes where Lurch and Thing appear together . However , Thing was regularly billed as `` Itself '' in the closing credits . | Question: who played wednesday addams in the tv series ?", ['Lisa Loring'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-73059'), ("Context: Duane Jones as Ben : An unknown stage actor , Jones ' performance depicted Ben as a `` comparatively calm and resourceful Negro '' ( a distinguished gentleman and former university professor , in real life ) , according to a movie reviewer in 1969 . Casting Jones as the hero was potentially controversial in 1968 : it was not typical for a black man to be the hero of an American film when the rest of the cast was composed of white actors at the time , but Romero said that Jones simply gave the best audition . He was in a few other films after Night of the Living Dead and continued working as a theater actor and director until his death in 1988 . Despite his other film roles , Jones worried that people only recognized him as Ben .   Judith O'Dea as Barbra Blair : A 23 - year - old commercial and stage actress , O'Dea once worked for Hardman and Eastman in Pittsburgh . O'Dea was in Hollywood seeking to enter the movie business at the time of audition . Starring in the film was a positive experience for her , she remarked in an interview . She admitted that horror movies terrified her , particularly Vincent Price 's House of Wax ( 1953 ) . Besides acting , O'Dea performed her own stunts , which she jokingly claimed amounted to `` lots of running '' . `` I honestly had no idea it would have such a lasting impact on our culture '' , assessing Night of the Living Dead . She was just as surprised by the renown the film brought her : `` People treat you differently . ( I 'm ) ho - hum Judy O'Dea until they realize ( I 'm ) Barbra from Night of the Living Dead . All of a sudden ( I 'm ) not so ho - hum anymore ! ''   Karl Hardman as Harry Cooper : One of the film 's producers ( alongside Streiner ) , Hardman is also the voice of the newscaster heard on the radio of Johnny 's car .   Marilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper : Eastman also played a female ghoul eating an insect .   Keith Wayne as Tom   Judith Ridley as Judy : Ridley later co-starred in Romero 's second feature There 's Always Vanilla ( 1971 ) .   Kyra Schon as Karen Cooper : Hardman 's 11 - year - old daughter , Schon also portrayed the mangled corpse on the house 's upstairs floor that Ben drags away .

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ('Context: <Tr> <Td colspan="6"> Following another beating , Celeste decides to leave Perry the day after trivia night .

Aside from a further victory against Charlton Athletic on 20 February 2016 , the club again went winless until their 2 -- 1 victory over relegation strugglers MK Dons , on 2 April 2016 . Fulham finished the 2015 / 16 Championship season in 20th place , avoiding relegation by 11 points . After yet another squad overhaul , the following season saw huge improvements in both results and performances . After a good start , which included a 1 - 0 win over newly - relegated Newcastle , Fulham found themselves in 2nd place at the end of August . A poor September followed , but a significant improvement from October onwards , which included the 5 - 0 thrashings of high - flying Huddersfield Town and Reading , got Fulham back into play - off contention . Fulham secured a 6th place finish after an impressive finish to the season , which saw Fulham collect 37 points out of their last 17 games , and entered the play - offs , where they were undone by a controversial Yann Kermorgant penalty , which saw Reading triumph 2 - 1 on aggregate . After a poor first half of the 2017 / 18 season , which included a 1 - 0 loss away to bottom placed Sunderland on 16 December 2017 , Fulham struggled to break the top half of the table . Following that loss at Sunderland , Fulham went on a club - record 23 game unbeaten run in the league , which included a 6 - 0 romping of Burton Albion and wins against fellow promotion rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers , Aston Villa and Cardiff City . The run ended on the final day of the season , as Fulham fell to a 3 - 1 defeat against Birmingham City . Had Fulham won , they would have finished the season in second place , as Cardiff failed to beat Reading . Instead they would have to face the play - offs for a second season running . After overcoming a 1 - 0 away defeat to Derby County in the semi finals , Fulham won the EFL Championship play - off Final against Aston Villa to return to the Premier League on 26 May 2018 , after securing their first win at Wembley in their 139 year history . | Question: when was the last time fulham played at wembley ?", ['26 May 2018'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-46775'), ("Context: Hugh Jackman as P.T.

Mr Pilkington has a larger but more unkempt farm , and is on bad terms with Mr Frederick of Pinchfield Farm . Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber . Through Napoleon 's human aide Mr. Whymper , Napoleon furiously learns that Frederick got the timber for free as he paid in counterfeit money . Napoleon orders the slogan `` Death to Pilkington '' changed to `` Death to Frederick '' . Immediately after the bum deal , Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm , killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder . Napoleon parlays his new `` Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy , but this proves too little too late as the `` Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory , and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads `` Serves you right '' . | Question: who said serves you right in animal farm ?", ['Pilkington'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-81279'), ("Context: Michael Kelly as Lieutenant Colonel Gary Volesky   Jason Ritter as Troy Denomy   Kate Bosworth as Gina Denomy   Sarah Wayne Callies as Leann Volesky   Jeremy Sisto as Sgt .

When I started , like you said , she was kind of a con artist , and manipulative , and doing things for money , and you know -- completely , kind of not a very good person . But since then , she 's fallen in love , she 's gotten married -- she 's gotten divorced ! -- and experienced life , its highs and lows and ups and downs and learned about family she did n't know she had . She 's gotten closer to certain members of her family and gained friendships . I do n't think Chelsea was someone who had girlfriends before when she was on the road and cons do n't really have good relationships . So she 's just a better person ; a better human being .

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ('Context: <Tr> <Td colspan="6"> Following another beating , Celeste decides to leave Perry the day after trivia night .

After a 2 -- 5 loss at home to Birmingham City , and lying in 12th place , Kit Symons was sacked as Fulham manager in November 2015 . It took 49 days to find a replacement , the club using Peter Grant and Stuart Gray in the interim , before appointing the Serbian Slaviša Jokanović on 27 December 2015 . Fulham 's fortunes did not improve greatly following Jokanović 's appointment , with no league wins until their 3 -- 1 victory over QPR on 13 February 2016 .

Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution .

Alternative terms used by academics and observers to describe this concept include "intermittent Major power" or "small Great power", asserting that Italy\'s position in the international arena can be described in this way.

Founded in 1999, the G20 aims to discuss policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability.  It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization.

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil . '' In Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 ( 1951 ) , the Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is `` excessive '' under the Eighth Amendment if it were `` a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial . | Question: what does excessive bail mean in the eighth amendment ?", ["a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial"], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-84583'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , The Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .

Following the prior two stages , shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others . It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died . It is not required to observe shiva for individuals who are less than thirty days old at the time of death . At the funeral , mourners wear an outer garment or ribbon that is torn during the procession in a ritual known as keriah . This garment is worn throughout the entirety of shiva . Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) . It is necessary for the burial spot to be entirely covered with earth in order for shiva to commence . This state lasts for the entire duration of shiva . During the period of shiva , individuals remain at home . Friends and family visit those in mourning in order to give their condolences and provide comfort .

A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Bradley Cooper as Rocket : A genetically engineered raccoon - like bounty hunter and mercenary who is a master of weapons and battle tactics .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians .

Filtration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive : it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure . About one - fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries ; four - fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries . Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day : 99 % of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed . Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive , due to diffusion , or active , due to pumping against a concentration gradient . Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active . Substances reabsorbed include : water , sodium , chloride , glucose , amino acids , lactate , magnesium , calcium , phosphate , uric acid , and bicarbonate . Substances secreted include urea , creatinine , potassium , hydrogen , and uric acid . Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate , and thereby maintain homeostasis , include ( along with the substance affected ) antidiuretic hormone ( water ) , aldosterone ( sodium , potassium ) , parathyroid hormone ( calcium , phosphate ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) .

Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber .

From 1975 standardized alphabetic grades where introduced with grades A , B , C , D , and E were passes , and f and U ( Unclassified ) were fails .

The pass rate and top awards by the Oxford & Cambridge board were also consistently higher than the other boards e.g. In 1976 , 27 % of Latin entrants gained an A , and ~ 17 % of French , German and Music candidates , this was attributed to the O&C board being primarily used by the Independent schools .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died .

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Bradley Cooper as Rocket : A genetically engineered raccoon - like bounty hunter and mercenary who is a master of weapons and battle tactics .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians . And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9 % from 1980 to 1998 , it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing . | Question: when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations ?", ['1975'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-35789'), ("Context: The four mechanisms used to create and process the filtrate ( the result of which is to convert blood to urine ) are filtration , reabsorption , secretion and excretion . Filtration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive : it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure . About one - fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries ; four - fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries . Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day : 99 % of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed . Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive , due to diffusion , or active , due to pumping against a concentration gradient . Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active . Substances reabsorbed include : water , sodium , chloride , glucose , amino acids , lactate , magnesium , calcium , phosphate , uric acid , and bicarbonate . Substances secreted include urea , creatinine , potassium , hydrogen , and uric acid . Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate , and thereby maintain homeostasis , include ( along with the substance affected ) antidiuretic hormone ( water ) , aldosterone ( sodium , potassium ) , parathyroid hormone ( calcium , phosphate ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) .

Mr Pilkington has a larger but more unkempt farm , and is on bad terms with Mr Frederick of Pinchfield Farm . Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber . Through Napoleon 's human aide Mr. Whymper , Napoleon furiously learns that Frederick got the timber for free as he paid in counterfeit money . Napoleon orders the slogan `` Death to Pilkington '' changed to `` Death to Frederick '' . Immediately after the bum deal , Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm , killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder . Napoleon parlays his new `` Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy , but this proves too little too late as the `` Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory , and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads `` Serves you right '' . | Question: who said serves you right in animal farm ?", ['Pilkington'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-81279'), ('Context: Initially candidates were only awarded a pass or fail classification , though the independent exam boards soon offered competing numeric and alphabetic classifications , for example 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 would be a pass , while grades 7 , 8 and 9 were fails from the JMB . From 1975 standardized alphabetic grades where introduced with grades A , B , C , D , and E were passes , and f and U ( Unclassified ) were fails .

The pass rate and top awards by the Oxford & Cambridge board were also consistently higher than the other boards e.g. In 1976 , 27 % of Latin entrants gained an A , and ~ 17 % of French , German and Music candidates , this was attributed to the O&C board being primarily used by the Independent schools . The proportion obtaining a pass , A-D , or equivalent was initially fixed at 57 % - 58 % , and remained under 60 % through the 1970s , though there was regional variation with Northern Ireland awarding consistently more pass grades than Wales e.g. In 1982 , the pass rates were : Northern Ireland 62 % , England 58 % Wales 53 % .

Roden Bros Ltd.\'s silver was supplied by the province of British Columbia and with it they produced a wide range of silver holloware and flatware in traditional English styles.  The company offered a variety of flatware patterns that included Stratford, Queens, and Louis XV.  Goldsmiths Stock Company were their exclusive selling agents from 1900 to 1922.  Roden Bros Ltd.\'s mark included the word Sterling, followed by 925, an R and a lion passant.In addition to silver hollowware and flatware, Roden Bros.  Ltd. produced cut crystal and medals.

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil . '' In Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 ( 1951 ) , the Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is `` excessive '' under the Eighth Amendment if it were `` a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial . | Question: what does excessive bail mean in the eighth amendment ?", ["a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial"], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-84583'), ("Context: Prior to the 19th century hospital reforms , the well - being of the child was thought to be in the hands of the mother ; therefore , there was little discussion of children 's medicine , and as a result next to no widespread formal institutions which focused on healing children . There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , The Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .

Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' .

Following the prior two stages , shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others . It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died . It is not required to observe shiva for individuals who are less than thirty days old at the time of death . At the funeral , mourners wear an outer garment or ribbon that is torn during the procession in a ritual known as keriah . This garment is worn throughout the entirety of shiva . Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) . It is necessary for the burial spot to be entirely covered with earth in order for shiva to commence . This state lasts for the entire duration of shiva . During the period of shiva , individuals remain at home . Friends and family visit those in mourning in order to give their condolences and provide comfort .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services .

The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty .

Filtration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive : it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure . About one - fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries ; four - fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries . Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day : 99 % of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed . Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive , due to diffusion , or active , due to pumping against a concentration gradient . Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active . Substances reabsorbed include : water , sodium , chloride , glucose , amino acids , lactate , magnesium , calcium , phosphate , uric acid , and bicarbonate . Substances secreted include urea , creatinine , potassium , hydrogen , and uric acid . Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate , and thereby maintain homeostasis , include ( along with the substance affected ) antidiuretic hormone ( water ) , aldosterone ( sodium , potassium ) , parathyroid hormone ( calcium , phosphate ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) .

In the 1910s the firm became known as Roden Bros.  Ltd. and were later taken over by Henry Birks and Sons in 1953.  Roden Bros Ltd.\'s silver was supplied by the province of British Columbia and with it they produced a wide range of silver holloware and flatware in traditional English styles.  The company offered a variety of flatware patterns that included Stratford, Queens, and Louis XV.  Goldsmiths Stock Company were their exclusive selling agents from 1900 to 1922.  Roden Bros Ltd.\'s mark included the word Sterling, followed by 925, an R and a lion passant.In addition to silver hollowware and flatware, Roden Bros.  Ltd. produced cut crystal and medals.

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil . '' In Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 ( 1951 ) , the Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is `` excessive '' under the Eighth Amendment if it were `` a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial . | Question: what does excessive bail mean in the eighth amendment ?", ["a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial"], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-84583'), ("Context: Prior to the 19th century hospital reforms , the well - being of the child was thought to be in the hands of the mother ; therefore , there was little discussion of children 's medicine , and as a result next to no widespread formal institutions which focused on healing children . There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , The Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .

Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' .

Following the prior two stages , shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others . It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died . It is not required to observe shiva for individuals who are less than thirty days old at the time of death . At the funeral , mourners wear an outer garment or ribbon that is torn during the procession in a ritual known as keriah . This garment is worn throughout the entirety of shiva . Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services .

The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty .

Filtration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive : it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure . About one - fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries ; four - fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries . Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day : 99 % of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed . Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive , due to diffusion , or active , due to pumping against a concentration gradient . Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active . Substances reabsorbed include : water , sodium , chloride , glucose , amino acids , lactate , magnesium , calcium , phosphate , uric acid , and bicarbonate . Substances secreted include urea , creatinine , potassium , hydrogen , and uric acid . Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate , and thereby maintain homeostasis , include ( along with the substance affected ) antidiuretic hormone ( water ) , aldosterone ( sodium , potassium ) , parathyroid hormone ( calcium , phosphate ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) .

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: Jesus\' Son (film)  Jesus\' Son is a 1999 drama film that was adapted from the eponymous short story collection by Denis Johnson.

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians .

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: Jesus\' Son (film)  Jesus\' Son is a 1999 drama film that was adapted from the eponymous short story collection by Denis Johnson.

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians . And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9 % from 1980 to 1998 , it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing . | Question: when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations ?", ['1975'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-35789'), ("Context: Bradley Cooper as Rocket : A genetically engineered raccoon - like bounty hunter and mercenary who is a master of weapons and battle tactics .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt. Rushmore, with its gigantic open-air sculpture of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and T. Roosevelt, is famous throughout the world (see Mount Rushmore National Memorial ).

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: Wings of Fire : An Autobiography of APJ Abdul Kalam ( 1999 ) , former President of India .

In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking .

The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back .

It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: Wings of Fire : An Autobiography of APJ Abdul Kalam ( 1999 ) , former President of India .

In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking .

The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back .

It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt. Rushmore, with its gigantic open-air sculpture of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and T. Roosevelt, is famous throughout the world (see Mount Rushmore National Memorial ).

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

Frank Sinatra  Francis Albert Sinatra ( ; ] ; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century.  He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide.  Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey.  Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the "bobby soxers".  He released his debut album, "The Voice of Frank Sinatra", in 1946.  Sinatra\'s professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack.  His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of "From Here to Eternity", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ("Context: Will Smith as Daryl Ward , a human LAPD officer .

Frank Sinatra  Francis Albert Sinatra ( ; ] ; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century.  He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide.  Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey.  Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the "bobby soxers".  He released his debut album, "The Voice of Frank Sinatra", in 1946.  Sinatra\'s professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack.  His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of "From Here to Eternity", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including "In the Wee Small Hours" (1955), "Songs for Swingin\' Lovers!

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ("Context: Will Smith as Daryl Ward , a human LAPD officer .

Leinster  Leinster ( — — ] ) is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the east of Ireland.  It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster.  Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster.  The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes.  In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. | Question: Patrick Kennedy is known for his collections of Irish  folktales from a province situated in which part of Ireland ?', ['the east of Ireland'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-220')]

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt. Rushmore, with its gigantic open-air sculpture of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and T. Roosevelt, is famous throughout the world (see Mount Rushmore National Memorial ).

The ritual is referred to as `` sitting shiva '' . Traditionally , there are five stages of mourning in Judaism . Shiva is considered the third stage of mourning , and constitutes of seven days . Following the prior two stages , shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others . It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died . It is not required to observe shiva for individuals who are less than thirty days old at the time of death . At the funeral , mourners wear an outer garment or ribbon that is torn during the procession in a ritual known as keriah . This garment is worn throughout the entirety of shiva . Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) . It is necessary for the burial spot to be entirely covered with earth in order for shiva to commence . This state lasts for the entire duration of shiva . During the period of shiva , individuals remain at home . Friends and family visit those in mourning in order to give their condolences and provide comfort .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

Following the prior two stages , shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others . It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died .

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Shiva ( Hebrew : שבעה \u200e , literally `` seven '' ) is the week - long mourning period in Judaism for first - degree relatives .

It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died . It is not required to observe shiva for individuals who are less than thirty days old at the time of death . At the funeral , mourners wear an outer garment or ribbon that is torn during the procession in a ritual known as keriah . This garment is worn throughout the entirety of shiva . Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) . It is necessary for the burial spot to be entirely covered with earth in order for shiva to commence . This state lasts for the entire duration of shiva . During the period of shiva , individuals remain at home . Friends and family visit those in mourning in order to give their condolences and provide comfort . The process , though dating back to biblical times , mimics the natural way an individual confronts and overcomes grief . Shiva allows for the individual to express their sorrow , discuss the loss of a loved one , and slowly re-enter society . | Question: how long do you sit shiva for a sibling ?", ['seven days'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-21301'), ('Context: Brian Ralston  Brian Ralston (born April 12, 1974) is a composer and musician living in Los Angeles.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt.

He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Shiva ( Hebrew : שבעה \u200e , literally `` seven '' ) is the week - long mourning period in Judaism for first - degree relatives .

It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died .

At the funeral , mourners wear an outer garment or ribbon that is torn during the procession in a ritual known as keriah . This garment is worn throughout the entirety of shiva . Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) . It is necessary for the burial spot to be entirely covered with earth in order for shiva to commence . This state lasts for the entire duration of shiva . During the period of shiva , individuals remain at home . Friends and family visit those in mourning in order to give their condolences and provide comfort .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver.

It was during the Great Depression that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow went on their two-year crime spree (1932-1934). The general attitude in the United States\xa0was against government and Bonnie and Clyde used that to their advantage. With an image closer to Robin Hood rather than mass murderers, Bonnie and Clyde captured the imagination of the nation.  Dates: Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910 -- May 23, 1934); Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909 -- May 23, 1934)  Also Known As: Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, The Barrow Gang  Overview of Bonnie and Clyde  In some ways it was easy to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde. They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the "big, bad law" who were "out to get them." Clyde\'s impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie\'s poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!)  continue reading below our video  Profile of Bonnie and Clyde  Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law.  As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde\'s many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations.  While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush.  Background of Bonnie  Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker\'s job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas).  From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4\' 11" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.)  Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn\'t a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced.  While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929.  Background of Clyde  Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde\'s parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives.  When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.  At that time, West Dallas was a very rough neighborhood and Clyde fit right in.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper Mérimée\'s novella Carmen.

The executive power of both the vice president and the president is granted under Article Two, Section One of the Constitution. The vice president is indirectly elected, together with the president, to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.  The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, and would normally ascend to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president.   The Office of the Vice President of the United States assists and organizes the vice president\'s official functions.  The vice president is also president of the United States Senate  and in that capacity only votes when it is necessary to break a tie. While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.   Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.  While the vice president\'s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments.  Origin  The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state\'s combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state\'s favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector\'s state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector\'s second vote would go to a statesman of national character.  Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son\'s chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot.  Roles of the vice president  The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression "only a heartbeat away from the presidency," and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate.  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.    President of the United States Senate  As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney\'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.  Regular duties  As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote.

Thirteen years ago, he received the diagnosis that tore his world apart: he had cancer of the tongue. Having faced down the fastest bowlers during his career as one of England's greatest-ever batsmen, he now had to take on an even more daunting foe. In this fascinating new book, his first autobiographical work for more than 15 years, Boycott not only relives his terrifying battle with cancer but also writes movingly about his long-time love Rachael, and their daughter Emma. He talks about his many other interests and friendships beyond cricket, with a great chapter on Brian Clough as well as revealing some surprising enthusiasms: Boycott and Katy Perry?  But Boycott has devoted his life to cricket, and his insights on the game, its players and those who write and talk about it are never less than frank, revealing, entertaining and very honest. He assesses the modern generation of players: how does he rate England's prolific captain Alastair Cook? And is Kevin Pietersen a batting genius or a player who has frittered away his talent? His opinions come with the authority of someone with profound knowledge of and love for the sport. In commentary, he refers to the 'corridor of uncertainty' for a batsman - but with Geoffrey Boycott there is never any room for that, which is why this book is such a compelling and entertaining read.  Download:  SportSport (UK) or sports (US) are all forms of usually competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.  Sport is one of the ten function systems of modern societies.  It is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition,  and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.  However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: Bridge, Chess, Draughts, Go, Xiangqi,   and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.  Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first.

"The Darling Buds of May" was a British television series first broadcast in 1991. It is set in an idyllic rural 1950s Kent, among a large, boisterous family. The show was very popular, and launched the acting career of Catherine Zeta Jones.

Along the way, the 41-year-old has picked up an Oscar, a Tony, a CBE, countless plaudits and a smattering of bad reviews.  She married Hollywood actor Michael Douglas in a lavish New York ceremony in 2000, however the couple have now decided to take some time apart to "evaluate and work on their marriage".  Few could have predicted that a girl born to a sweet factory owner and a seamstress would go on to become one of the most famous actresses in the world.  At the age of 10, the Welsh star won a national talent contest singing a Shirley Bassey song before landing roles in various West End productions.  Image caption Zeta Jones started acting at a very young age  She got her big break at the age of 17, following a promotion from second understudy to the lead role in the hit musical 42nd Street.  But it was Zeta Jones\'s first major TV role, in the 1991 comedy drama The Darling Buds of May, that made her a household name.  Set in rural Kent in the 1950s, viewers fell in love with the Larkins, played by Sir David Jason and Pam Ferris.  Zeta Jones played their fresh-faced sweetheart daughter Mariette.  Squeaky-clean perception  Off camera, her personal life began to hit the headlines more than her acting ability.  Her relationship with Blue Peter presenter John Leslie was well documented. She also became involved with Simply Red star Mick Hucknall and Soldier Soldier actor Angus MacFadyen.  After leaving The Darling Buds of May, Zeta Jones turned her attention to film, but admitted finding it hard to shake off the public\'s squeaky-clean perception of her.

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?', ['motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4255'), ('Context: Makin\' Up for Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers\' Song)  "Makin\' Up for Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers\' Song)" is a song recorded as a duet by American country music artists Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris.

Discovered by space telescopes at some point between 2050 and 2077, Pandora has been the single most interesting thing to happen to the human race in hundreds of years. The news services love to run clips of the wild scenery on Pandora and its bizarre flora and fauna .  To the cultures of Earth , Pandora is mysterious, primal and terrifying. Even from orbit, the scope of florae present on the surface indicates a moon brimming with life. One of the creatures on Pandora is the direhorse , a gray-skinned, hexapodal horse-like animal with bioluminescent qualities that the Na\'vi ride when hunting. The Na\'vi also ride the mountain banshee to hunt from the air, but the hunter can become prey in the presence of the great leonopteryx . In the canopy below, other deadly yet exotic animals roam: vicious packs of viperwolves , thick skinned hammerhead titanotheres and the most fearsome creature of all, the thanator . Other than the richness of varying colors, the trees resemble those of Earth. They have the familiar trunks, branches and leaves, though due to the difference in gravity, many of the shapes appear strange to humans and the proportions are greater because of the lower gravity. The trees and plant life of Pandora have formed electrochemical connections between their roots and effectively act as neurons, creating a moon-wide "brain" that has achieved sentience, which is known to the Na\'vi as Eywa .  Pandora, despite being almost as large as Earth, is only a moon of the gas giant Polyphemus, which has thirteen other moons. However, due to the smaller size, its gravity is 20% less than Earth\'s. Due to Pandora\'s lower gravity, most creatures on Pandora are hexapods (six-legged), although the Na\'vi resemble humans and have only two legs. Creatures roam the air and forest canopy below, similar to Earth\'s animals, but on a scale several times larger. Pandora\'s wildlife also have bioluminescent qualities. Depending on the position of the various moons, Pandora can have two or even three moons in its sky at once. Pandora and the other moons cast large black shadows on Polyphemus.  Pandora looks like a lush paradise by Earth standards during the day, but at night, virtually all life on the moon exhibits bioluminescent qualities in various shades of blue, purple and green. This possibly explains the Na\'vi\'s blue skin color, which most likely provides them better camouflage at night on Pandora.  Contents  Edit  Pandora\'s atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (>18%), xenon (>5.5%), methane, and hydrogen sulfide (>1%) and is about 20% denser than the atmosphere on Earth primarily due to the high percentage of Xenon; a heavy, colourless, odourless, and generally unren active noble gas. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the Pandoran atmosphere makes it extremely poisonous to humans, rendering them unconscious in about 20 seconds and causing death in about 4 minutes when they venture out unprotected by specialized breathing masks. The hydrogen sulfide present is also quite poisonous; concentrations over 1000 ppm (0.1\xa0%) can cause immediate collapse with subsequent loss of breathing, even after inhalation of a single breath.  The increased air resistance within this denser atmosphere has a number of effects:  Lower terminal velocity. Combined with Pandora\'s twenty-percent lower gravity, a freely falling object\'s maximum speed is significantly less than on earth. A Na\'vi who happens to fall from a flying mountain banshee has a good chance of surviving uninjured if they are over a forested area. Even over water, falling spread-eagled can reduce their speed sufficiently to allow an impact with the surface that will not knock them unconscious.

Catherine of Aragon, whose parents united Castile and Aragon with their marriage, was promised in marriage to the son of Henry VII of England, in order to promote the alliance between the Spanish and English rulers.  See: more Catherine of Aragon Facts  Catherine of Aragon Biography  Catherine of Aragon's role in history was, first, as a marriage partner to strengthen the alliance of England and Spain (Castile and Aragon), and later, as the center of Henry VIII's struggle for an annulment that would permit him to remarry and try for a male heir to the English throne for the Tudor dynasty . She was not simply a pawn in the latter, but her stubbornness in fighting for her marriage -- and her daughter's right to inherit -- were key in how that struggle ended, with Henry VIII separating the Church of England from the Church of Rome's authority.  continue reading below our video  What are the Seven Wonders of the World  Catherine of Aragon Family Background  Catherine of Aragon was the fifth child of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon. She was born in Alcalá de Henares.  Catherine was likely named for her mother's grandmother, Katherine of Lancaster, the daughter of Constance of Castile who was second wife of John of Gaunt, himself son of England's Edward III. Constance and John's daughter, Catherine of Lancaster, married Henry III of Castile and was the mother of John II of Castile, Isabella's father. Constance of Castile was the daughter of Peter (Pedro) of Castile, known as Peter the Cruel, who was overthrown by his brother Henry (Enrique) II. John of Gaunt tried to claim the throne of Castile on the basis of his wife Constance's descent from Peter.  Catherine's father Ferdinand was the great-grandson of Philippa of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt and his first wife, Blanche of Lancaster. Philippa's brother was Henry IV of England. Thus, Catherine of Aragon had considerable English royal heritage herself.  Her parents were also both part of the House of Trastámara, a dynasty that ruled kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula from 1369 to 1516, descended from King Henry (Enrique) II of Castile who overthrew his brother, Peter, in 1369, part of the War of the Spanish Succession -- the same Peter who was the father of Isabella's grandmother Constance of Castile , and the same Henry John of Gaunt tried to overthrow.  Catherine of Aragon Childhood and Education:  In her early years, Catherine traveled extensively within Spain with her parents as they fought their war to remove the Muslims from Granada.  Because Isabella regretted the lack of her own educational preparation when she became a ruling queen, she educated her daughters well, preparing them for their likely roles as queens. So Catherine had an extensive education, with many European humanists as her teachers. Among the tutors who educated Isabella, and then her daughters, was Beatriz Galindo . Catherine spoke Spanish, Latin, French and English, and was well-read in philosophy and theology.  Alliance with England Through Marriage  Catherine was born in 1485, the same year Henry VII seized the crown of England as the first Tudor monarch. Arguably, Catherine's own royal descent was more legitimate than Henry's, who was descended from their common ancestor John of Gaunt through the children of Katherine Swynford , his third wife, who were born before their marriage and later legitimized but declared ineligible for the throne.  In 1486, Henry's first son, Arthur was born. Henry VII sought powerful connections for his children through marriage; so did Isabella and Ferdinand. Ferdinand and Isabella first sent diplomats to England to negotiate Catherine's marriage to Arthur in 1487. The next year, Henry VII agreed to the marriage, and a formal agreement including dowry specifications was drwan up. Ferdinand and Isabella were to pay the dowry in two parts | Question: Which country was the birthplace of Henry V111’s first wife Catherine Of Aragon ?", ['spain'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2091'), ("Context: Sheffield United F.C.Sheffield United Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation. Neil Warnock resigned as manager after the Blades went down.

It was during the Great Depression that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow went on their two-year crime spree (1932-1934). The general attitude in the United States\xa0was against government and Bonnie and Clyde used that to their advantage. With an image closer to Robin Hood rather than mass murderers, Bonnie and Clyde captured the imagination of the nation.  Dates: Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910 -- May 23, 1934); Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909 -- May 23, 1934)  Also Known As: Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, The Barrow Gang  Overview of Bonnie and Clyde  In some ways it was easy to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde. They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the "big, bad law" who were "out to get them." Clyde\'s impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie\'s poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!)  continue reading below our video  Profile of Bonnie and Clyde  Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law.  As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde\'s many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations.  While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush.  Background of Bonnie  Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker\'s job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas).  From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4\' 11" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.)  Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn\'t a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced.  While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929.  Background of Clyde  Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde\'s parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives.  When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.  At that time, West Dallas was a very rough neighborhood and Clyde fit right in.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper Mérimée\'s novella Carmen.

The executive power of both the vice president and the president is granted under Article Two, Section One of the Constitution. The vice president is indirectly elected, together with the president, to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.  The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, and would normally ascend to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president.   The Office of the Vice President of the United States assists and organizes the vice president\'s official functions.  The vice president is also president of the United States Senate  and in that capacity only votes when it is necessary to break a tie. While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.   Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.  While the vice president\'s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments.  Origin  The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state\'s combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state\'s favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector\'s state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector\'s second vote would go to a statesman of national character.  Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son\'s chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot.  Roles of the vice president  The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression "only a heartbeat away from the presidency," and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate.  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.    President of the United States Senate  As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney\'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.  Regular duties  As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote.

Thirteen years ago, he received the diagnosis that tore his world apart: he had cancer of the tongue. Having faced down the fastest bowlers during his career as one of England's greatest-ever batsmen, he now had to take on an even more daunting foe. In this fascinating new book, his first autobiographical work for more than 15 years, Boycott not only relives his terrifying battle with cancer but also writes movingly about his long-time love Rachael, and their daughter Emma. He talks about his many other interests and friendships beyond cricket, with a great chapter on Brian Clough as well as revealing some surprising enthusiasms: Boycott and Katy Perry?  But Boycott has devoted his life to cricket, and his insights on the game, its players and those who write and talk about it are never less than frank, revealing, entertaining and very honest. He assesses the modern generation of players: how does he rate England's prolific captain Alastair Cook? And is Kevin Pietersen a batting genius or a player who has frittered away his talent? His opinions come with the authority of someone with profound knowledge of and love for the sport. In commentary, he refers to the 'corridor of uncertainty' for a batsman - but with Geoffrey Boycott there is never any room for that, which is why this book is such a compelling and entertaining read.  Download:  SportSport (UK) or sports (US) are all forms of usually competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.  Sport is one of the ten function systems of modern societies.  It is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition,  and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.  However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: Bridge, Chess, Draughts, Go, Xiangqi,   and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.  Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.  Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news.  Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, | Question: In which sport do commentators talk about the 'Corridor of uncertainty'?", ['toss', 'cricket club', 'cricket'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5168'), ('Context: Total number of yellow cards : 187   Average yellow cards per match : 2.92   Total number of red cards : 10   Average red cards per match : 0.16   First yellow card of the tournament : Neymar for Brazil against Croatia   First red card of the tournament : Maxi Pereira for Uruguay against Costa Rica   Fastest yellow card from kick off : 2 minutes Thiago Silva for Brazil against Netherlands   Fastest yellow card after coming on as a substitute : 3 minutes José Miguel Cubero for Costa Rica against Italy ( introduced in the 68th minute )   Latest yellow card in a match without extra time : 90 + 4 minutes João Moutinho for Portugal against Ghana   Latest yellow card in a match with extra time : 120 + 4 minutes Ezequiel Garay for Argentina against Switzerland   Fastest dismissal from kick off : 37 minutes Pepe for Portugal against Germany   Fastest dismissal of a substitute : 20 minutes Ante Rebić for Croatia against Mexico ( introduced in the 69th minute )   Latest dismissal in a match without extra time : 90 + 4 minutes Maxi Pereira for Uruguay against Costa Rica   Shortest time difference between two yellow cards given to the same player : 11 minutes Kostas Katsouranis for Greece against Japan ( booked in the 27th minute and again in the 38th minute )   Most yellow cards ( team ) : 14 Brazil   Most red cards ( team ) : 1 Belgium , Cameroon , Costa Rica , Croatia , Ecuador , Greece , Honduras , Italy , Portugal , Uruguay   Fewest yellow cards ( team ) : 2 Portugal   Most yellow cards ( player ) : 3 Thiago Silva   Most red cards ( player ) : 1 Steven Defour , Óscar Duarte , Kostas Katsouranis , Claudio Marchisio , Wilson Palacios , Pepe , Maxi Pereira , Ante Rebić , Alex Song , Antonio Valencia   Most yellow cards ( match ) : 8 Costa Rica vs Greece   Most red cards ( match ) : 1 Uruguay vs Costa Rica , France vs Honduras , Germany vs Portugal , Cameroon vs Croatia , Japan vs Greece , Croatia vs Mexico , Italy vs Uruguay , Ecuador vs France , South Korea vs Belgium , Costa Rica vs Greece   Fewest yellow cards ( match ) : 1 England vs Italy , Iran vs Nigeria , Switzerland vs France , Germany vs Ghana , United States vs Portugal , Honduras vs Switzerland , Ecuador vs France , France vs Nigeria , Brazil vs Germany   Most cards in one match : 1 red card , 8 yellow cards Costa Rica vs Greece | Question: number of yellow cards in 2014 world cup ?', ['187'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-21937'), ("Context: Bloomingdale Firehouse  Bloomingdale Firehouse, also known as the Brown Square Station, is a historic former firehouse at 267 Plantation Street/676 Franklin Street in Worcester, Massachusetts.

"The Darling Buds of May" was a British television series first broadcast in 1991. It is set in an idyllic rural 1950s Kent, among a large, boisterous family. The show was very popular, and launched the acting career of Catherine Zeta Jones.

Along the way, the 41-year-old has picked up an Oscar, a Tony, a CBE, countless plaudits and a smattering of bad reviews.  She married Hollywood actor Michael Douglas in a lavish New York ceremony in 2000, however the couple have now decided to take some time apart to "evaluate and work on their marriage".  Few could have predicted that a girl born to a sweet factory owner and a seamstress would go on to become one of the most famous actresses in the world.  At the age of 10, the Welsh star won a national talent contest singing a Shirley Bassey song before landing roles in various West End productions.  Image caption Zeta Jones started acting at a very young age  She got her big break at the age of 17, following a promotion from second understudy to the lead role in the hit musical 42nd Street.  But it was Zeta Jones\'s first major TV role, in the 1991 comedy drama The Darling Buds of May, that made her a household name.  Set in rural Kent in the 1950s, viewers fell in love with the Larkins, played by Sir David Jason and Pam Ferris.  Zeta Jones played their fresh-faced sweetheart daughter Mariette.  Squeaky-clean perception  Off camera, her personal life began to hit the headlines more than her acting ability.  Her relationship with Blue Peter presenter John Leslie was well documented. She also became involved with Simply Red star Mick Hucknall and Soldier Soldier actor Angus MacFadyen.  After leaving The Darling Buds of May, Zeta Jones turned her attention to film, but admitted finding it hard to shake off the public\'s squeaky-clean perception of her.

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?', ['motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4255'), ('Context: Makin\' Up for Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers\' Song)  "Makin\' Up for Lost Time (The Dallas Lovers\' Song)" is a song recorded as a duet by American country music artists Crystal Gayle and Gary Morris.

Discovered by space telescopes at some point between 2050 and 2077, Pandora has been the single most interesting thing to happen to the human race in hundreds of years. The news services love to run clips of the wild scenery on Pandora and its bizarre flora and fauna .  To the cultures of Earth , Pandora is mysterious, primal and terrifying. Even from orbit, the scope of florae present on the surface indicates a moon brimming with life. One of the creatures on Pandora is the direhorse , a gray-skinned, hexapodal horse-like animal with bioluminescent qualities that the Na\'vi ride when hunting. The Na\'vi also ride the mountain banshee to hunt from the air, but the hunter can become prey in the presence of the great leonopteryx . In the canopy below, other deadly yet exotic animals roam: vicious packs of viperwolves , thick skinned hammerhead titanotheres and the most fearsome creature of all, the thanator . Other than the richness of varying colors, the trees resemble those of Earth. They have the familiar trunks, branches and leaves, though due to the difference in gravity, many of the shapes appear strange to humans and the proportions are greater because of the lower gravity. The trees and plant life of Pandora have formed electrochemical connections between their roots and effectively act as neurons, creating a moon-wide "brain" that has achieved sentience, which is known to the Na\'vi as Eywa .  Pandora, despite being almost as large as Earth, is only a moon of the gas giant Polyphemus, which has thirteen other moons. However, due to the smaller size, its gravity is 20% less than Earth\'s. Due to Pandora\'s lower gravity, most creatures on Pandora are hexapods (six-legged), although the Na\'vi resemble humans and have only two legs. Creatures roam the air and forest canopy below, similar to Earth\'s animals, but on a scale several times larger. Pandora\'s wildlife also have bioluminescent qualities. Depending on the position of the various moons, Pandora can have two or even three moons in its sky at once. Pandora and the other moons cast large black shadows on Polyphemus.  Pandora looks like a lush paradise by Earth standards during the day, but at night, virtually all life on the moon exhibits bioluminescent qualities in various shades of blue, purple and green. This possibly explains the Na\'vi\'s blue skin color, which most likely provides them better camouflage at night on Pandora.  Contents  Edit  Pandora\'s atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (>18%), xenon (>5.5%), methane, and hydrogen sulfide (>1%) and is about 20% denser than the atmosphere on Earth primarily due to the high percentage of Xenon; a heavy, colourless, odourless, and generally unren active noble gas. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the Pandoran atmosphere makes it extremely poisonous to humans, rendering them unconscious in about 20 seconds and causing death in about 4 minutes when they venture out unprotected by specialized breathing masks. The hydrogen sulfide present is also quite poisonous; concentrations over 1000 ppm (0.1\xa0%) can cause immediate collapse with subsequent loss of breathing, even after inhalation of a single breath.  The increased air resistance within this denser atmosphere has a number of effects:  Lower terminal velocity. Combined with Pandora\'s twenty-percent lower gravity, a freely falling object\'s maximum speed is significantly less than on earth. A Na\'vi who happens to fall from a flying mountain banshee has a good chance of surviving uninjured if they are over a forested area. Even over water, falling spread-eagled can reduce their speed sufficiently to allow an impact with the surface that will not knock them unconscious.  The increased mass of the denser air means that more force is required to accelerate it as it | Question: What movie took place on the moon of Pandora?', ['avatar'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3876'), ("Context: DuSable High School  Jean Baptiste Point DuSable High School was a public 4–year high school located in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States.

Catherine of Aragon, whose parents united Castile and Aragon with their marriage, was promised in marriage to the son of Henry VII of England, in order to promote the alliance between the Spanish and English rulers.  See: more Catherine of Aragon Facts  Catherine of Aragon Biography  Catherine of Aragon's role in history was, first, as a marriage partner to strengthen the alliance of England and Spain (Castile and Aragon), and later, as the center of Henry VIII's struggle for an annulment that would permit him to remarry and try for a male heir to the English throne for the Tudor dynasty . She was not simply a pawn in the latter, but her stubbornness in fighting for her marriage -- and her daughter's right to inherit -- were key in how that struggle ended, with Henry VIII separating the Church of England from the Church of Rome's authority.  continue reading below our video  What are the Seven Wonders of the World  Catherine of Aragon Family Background  Catherine of Aragon was the fifth child of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon. She was born in Alcalá de Henares.  Catherine was likely named for her mother's grandmother, Katherine of Lancaster, the daughter of Constance of Castile who was second wife of John of Gaunt, himself son of England's Edward III. Constance and John's daughter, Catherine of Lancaster, married Henry III of Castile and was the mother of John II of Castile, Isabella's father. Constance of Castile was the daughter of Peter (Pedro) of Castile, known as Peter the Cruel, who was overthrown by his brother Henry (Enrique) II. John of Gaunt tried to claim the throne of Castile on the basis of his wife Constance's descent from Peter.  Catherine's father Ferdinand was the great-grandson of Philippa of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt and his first wife, Blanche of Lancaster. Philippa's brother was Henry IV of England. Thus, Catherine of Aragon had considerable English royal heritage herself.  Her parents were also both part of the House of Trastámara, a dynasty that ruled kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula from 1369 to 1516, descended from King Henry (Enrique) II of Castile who overthrew his brother, Peter, in 1369, part of the War of the Spanish Succession -- the same Peter who was the father of Isabella's grandmother Constance of Castile , and the same Henry John of Gaunt tried to overthrow.  Catherine of Aragon Childhood and Education:  In her early years, Catherine traveled extensively within Spain with her parents as they fought their war to remove the Muslims from Granada.  Because Isabella regretted the lack of her own educational preparation when she became a ruling queen, she educated her daughters well, preparing them for their likely roles as queens. So Catherine had an extensive education, with many European humanists as her teachers. Among the tutors who educated Isabella, and then her daughters, was Beatriz Galindo . Catherine spoke Spanish, Latin, French and English, and was well-read in philosophy and theology.  Alliance with England Through Marriage  Catherine was born in 1485, the same year Henry VII seized the crown of England as the first Tudor monarch. Arguably, Catherine's own royal descent was more legitimate than Henry's, who was descended from their common ancestor John of Gaunt through the children of Katherine Swynford , his third wife, who were born before their marriage and later legitimized but declared ineligible for the throne.  In 1486, Henry's first son, Arthur was born. Henry VII sought powerful connections for his children through marriage; so did Isabella and Ferdinand. Ferdinand and Isabella first sent diplomats to England to negotiate Catherine's marriage to Arthur in 1487. The next year, Henry VII agreed to the marriage, and a formal agreement including dowry specifications was drwan up. Ferdinand and Isabella were to pay the dowry in two parts | Question: Which country was the birthplace of Henry V111’s first wife Catherine Of Aragon ?", ['spain'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2091'), ("Context: Sheffield United F.C.Sheffield United Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation.

As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.

Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills.

He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.

It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority .

Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills.

The neighborhood has experienced years of poverty, crime, and neglect.  However, there are new houses being built and crime has dropped in recent years.   Neighbourhood  A neighbourhood (British English), or neighborhood (American English; see spelling differences), is a geographically localised community within a larger city, town, suburb or rural area.  Neighbourhoods are often social communities with considerable face-to-face interaction among members.  Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition, but the following may serve as a starting point: "…Neighbourhood is generally defined spatially as a specific geographic area and functionally as a set of social networks.  Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial units in which face-to-face social interactions occur—the personal settings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise youth, and maintain effective social control." | Question: What do Wrigley Park and social networks have in common?', ['Neighbourhood'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-5086'), ("Context: In England , sheriffs originally determined whether to grant bail to criminal suspects . Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: The Human Condition (film series)  The Human Condition (人間の條件 , Ningen no jōken ) is a Japanese epic film trilogy made between 1959 and 1961, based on the six-volume novel published from 1956 to 1958 by Junpei Gomikawa.

Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution .

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: The Human Condition (film series)  The Human Condition (人間の條件 , Ningen no jōken ) is a Japanese epic film trilogy made between 1959 and 1961, based on the six-volume novel published from 1956 to 1958 by Junpei Gomikawa.

Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood .

He was one of Hollywood\'s major stars from the 1940\'s onwards.  In his first five years as a movie actor he was nominated four times for the Best Actor Oscar and he was ranked by the American Film Institute at number twelve on their list of Greatest Male Stars of All Time. He received five Academy Award nominations in total and won one Best Actor Oscar for his performance in 1962 as Atticus Finch in the film \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'. In May 2003, only two weeks before Peck\'s death, his character, Atticus Finch, was voted the greatest screen hero of all time by the American Film Institute.  In addition to his Oscar, Peck received many awards including the Academy\'s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1967, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 1989, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his humanitarian work. It is no exaggeration to say that he was one of the great legends of Hollywood\'s Golden Age.  Search Amazon for Gregory Peck  Biography  He was born Eldred Gregory Peck on April 5, 1916 in La Jolla, California where his father was a pharmacist. He lived with his grandmother in La Jolla after his parents divorced when he was six and at the age of ten he was sent to St John\'s Roman Catholic Military Academy in Los Angeles. After 4 years his grandmother died and Peck went to live with his father again and began attending San Diego High School.  After graduating he spent one year at San Diego State Teacher\'s College where he took courses in drama and public speaking and then enrolled as a medical student at the University of California, Berkeley, respecting his father\'s wish that he should become a doctor. However,  Peck did not enjoy his medical studies and soon changed to studying English with the aim of becoming a newspaper reporter. His main interest outside his studies was rowing and with his 6\'3" athletic frame he was selected to represent the University.  He developed an interest in acting whilst at Berkeley and he became a regular performer in the university\'s Little Theater, discovering a natural talent and flair he had hitherto not known he possessed. When he graduated with a degree in English in 1939 he changed his name from Eldred to Gregory Peck and relocated to New York City to pursue his new vocation.  Acting Career 1940  He studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse under acting teacher Sanford Meisner and, to earn money to live, he worked for a while as a fairground barker at the 1939 World\'s Fair. Within a year he was filling small roles in short-run travelling shows but his natural, easy style marked him out, and in 1942 he was selected for his professional debut on Broadway as the lead in Emlyn Williams\'s play, \'The Morning Star\'.  During his first year as a full time actor Peck began to be noticed and to receive offers from Hollywood. He was very careful throughout his career about selecting film roles and he rejected the first movie offers made to him. After playing a double role in the stage play \'The Willow and I\', he appeared in Irwin Shaw\'s drama "Sons and Soldiers," co-starring with Stella Adler and Karl Malden and he finally accepted his debut movie role playing a resistance fighter in \'Days of Glory\' in 1944.  Movie Actor 1944  His next role, in 1946, as a priest, Father Francis Chisholm, in \'The Keys of the Kingdom\' was a resounding success and brought him his first Academy Award nomination. It was the start of a run of movie successes which made Peck a major Hollywood star. Over the next few years he had roles in hit movies, first for MGM with \'The Valley of Decision\' in 1945, and | Question: In 2003, what character was voted by the American Film Institute to be the greatest hero in American film?', ['atticus finch'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3107'), ("Context: Anna Kendrick as Princess Poppy , the princess and later queen of the Trolls and Branch 's love interest .

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.

The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.

He was one of Hollywood\'s major stars from the 1940\'s onwards.  In his first five years as a movie actor he was nominated four times for the Best Actor Oscar and he was ranked by the American Film Institute at number twelve on their list of Greatest Male Stars of All Time. He received five Academy Award nominations in total and won one Best Actor Oscar for his performance in 1962 as Atticus Finch in the film \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'. In May 2003, only two weeks before Peck\'s death, his character, Atticus Finch, was voted the greatest screen hero of all time by the American Film Institute.  In addition to his Oscar, Peck received many awards including the Academy\'s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1967, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 1989, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his humanitarian work. It is no exaggeration to say that he was one of the great legends of Hollywood\'s Golden Age.  Search Amazon for Gregory Peck  Biography  He was born Eldred Gregory Peck on April 5, 1916 in La Jolla, California where his father was a pharmacist. He lived with his grandmother in La Jolla after his parents divorced when he was six and at the age of ten he was sent to St John\'s Roman Catholic Military Academy in Los Angeles. After 4 years his grandmother died and Peck went to live with his father again and began attending San Diego High School.  After graduating he spent one year at San Diego State Teacher\'s College where he took courses in drama and public speaking and then enrolled as a medical student at the University of California, Berkeley, respecting his father\'s wish that he should become a doctor. However,  Peck did not enjoy his medical studies and soon changed to studying English with the aim of becoming a newspaper reporter. His main interest outside his studies was rowing and with his 6\'3" athletic frame he was selected to represent the University.  He developed an interest in acting whilst at Berkeley and he became a regular performer in the university\'s Little Theater, discovering a natural talent and flair he had hitherto not known he possessed. When he graduated with a degree in English in 1939 he changed his name from Eldred to Gregory Peck and relocated to New York City to pursue his new vocation.  Acting Career 1940  He studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse under acting teacher Sanford Meisner and, to earn money to live, he worked for a while as a fairground barker at the 1939 World\'s Fair. Within a year he was filling small roles in short-run travelling shows but his natural, easy style marked him out, and in 1942 he was selected for his professional debut on Broadway as the lead in Emlyn Williams\'s play, \'The Morning Star\'.  During his first year as a full time actor Peck began to be noticed and to receive offers from Hollywood. He was very careful throughout his career about selecting film roles and he rejected the first movie offers made to him. After playing a double role in the stage play \'The Willow and I\', he appeared in Irwin Shaw\'s drama "Sons and Soldiers," co-starring with Stella Adler and Karl Malden and he finally accepted his debut movie role playing a resistance fighter in \'Days of Glory\' in 1944.  Movie Actor 1944  His next role, in 1946, as a priest, Father Francis Chisholm, in \'The Keys of the Kingdom\' was a resounding success and brought him his first Academy Award nomination. It was the start of a run of movie successes which made Peck a major Hollywood star. Over the next few years he had roles in hit movies, first for MGM with \'The Valley of Decision\' in 1945, and | Question: In 2003, what character was voted by the American Film Institute to be the greatest hero in American film?', ['atticus finch'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3107'), ("Context: Anna Kendrick as Princess Poppy , the princess and later queen of the Trolls and Branch 's love interest .

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)

As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.  They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking. | Question: When was the American patriot Hamilton, New York Wass named after born?', ['January 11, 1755 or 1757July'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-945'), ('Context: E-Borders  e-Borders was an advanced passenger information programme which aimed to collect and store information on passengers and crew entering and leaving the United Kingdom.

The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.

Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)  Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold.  Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. | Question: How many cards can a player choose from to be part of their hand in the card game that was the culmination game of the United States Poker Championship?', ['seven'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-5318'), ("Context: Lurch ( Ted Cassidy ) -- The Addams ' loyal butler , who mainly speaks in grunts or groans .

The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money.

Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation\'s financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and "The New York Post" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

His decisions favoring highways over public transit helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island and influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners who spread his philosophies across the nation despite not training in those professions.  Moses would call himself a "coordinator" and was referred to in the media as a "master builder". | Question: What was the creator of the Moshulu Parkway known as?', ['"master builder" of mid-20th century New York City'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-1510'), ('Context: Rob (TV series)  Rob (stylized in promos as ¡Rob!)  is an American sitcom television series that premiered on CBS on January 12, 2012, at 8:30 pm (ET) as a mid-season replacement for "Rules of Engagement", and ended on March 1, 2012.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians. All the big events of the League of Nations were recorded in wampum. | Question: Indians used wampum for money, what was wampum ?', ['beads or shells'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7011'), ('Context: Buddy MacKay  Kenneth Hood "Buddy" MacKay Jr. (born March 22, 1933) is an American politician and diplomat from Florida.

Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians. All the big events of the League of Nations were recorded in wampum. | Question: Indians used wampum for money, what was wampum ?', ['beads or shells'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7011'), ('Context: Screen Gems Network  Screen Gems Network (SGN) was an American television program which ran in syndication from 1999 to September 9, 2002, launched by Columbia TriStar Television Distribution and produced by Evolution.

In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth.  If the citizen\'s heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire.  Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal.  Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin .  A damned human "in damnation" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God\'s favor.  In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.   Ancient Egyptian religion  Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.  It centered on the Egyptians\' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.

Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".

The "sidekick" to Morse, Lewis is a Detective Sergeant in the Thames Valley Police, and appears in all 13 Morse novels. In the television adaptation, Inspector Morse, he is played by Kevin Whately. Following the conclusion of the series, Whately reprised the role as the lead character in Lewis, in which the character has been promoted to Inspector.  Character history  Inspector Morse (TV and novels)  Lewis is a sergeant on the staff of the Thames Valley Police in Oxford, England, and in Inspector Morse is assistant to the titular Detective Chief Inspector Morse. Although Lewis\'s given name is Robert (Robbie), he was rarely referred to as anything but "Sergeant Lewis" or "Lewis."  The background and personality of Lewis\xa0– a working class, easygoing family man with a Geordie accent (in the TV series; he is Welsh in the novels)\xa0– is frequently contrasted with that of Morse\xa0– Oxford educated, RP-accented, lifetime bachelor. Morse frequently uses these differences to insult or demean Lewis, perhaps from Morse\'s point of view in a playful manner, but Lewis is often not amused by the jabs. In his frustration, Lewis is often more in step with their joint superior Chief Superintendent Strange, himself an evident supporter of Lewis; however, despite a great respect towards Strange, Lewis is always unflinchingly loyal to Morse and follows his lead.  One notable difference between the Lewis from the novels and Whately\'s portrayal is that Lewis in the novels is an older man in his early sixties. When Whately auditioned for the role and then learned this fact, he considered it unlikely that he would get the part. However, Colin Dexter has consistently stated that the younger Lewis is an improvement on the character he originally created, and that if he could start the novels afresh he would begin with Lewis as he is seen in the television adaptation.  In Inspector Morse, Lewis is often shown following a hunch that Morse criticises, and in the end Lewis is usually proved correct, or at least more correct than Morse. Near the end of the television series, Lewis moves on in his career and takes a promotion. With the end of Inspector Morse and the death of its star, John Thaw, Lewis\'s adventures had seemed to come to an end.  In the episode "The Dead of Jericho", Lewis tells Morse "It\'s also my birthday". The first victim is killed on 11 June, and this utterance occurs a few days to a week later. This puts Lewis\' birthday in mid-June.  Lewis does not make an appearance in the episode "The Wench is Dead", as he is out of town on an inspector\'s course.  Lewis  In the pilot episode, Lewis returns to Oxford from a two-year stint training police in the British Virgin Islands, following the death of his wife Valerie in a hit-and-run accident. Lewis still must work partly in the shadow of the now-five-years-dead Inspector Morse, who some time prior to his death had worked a case involving one of the murder suspects as a juvenile. In the new series, Lewis gains his own junior, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (played by Laurence Fox), a Cambridge-educated man who joined the police after giving up training for the priesthood. Another staple of the series, pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (played by Clare Holman), appears late in the Morse series, and continues on through all of the Lewis episodes as a witty part of the team, with a cynical sense of humour and as a romantic interest to him.  The popularity of the one-off episode spurred the continuation of the story into a total of nine series comprising 33 episodes, the most recent airing in 2015. In the latest series, Lewis had retired from the police force, but is brought back as a consultant to work with Hathaway, who is now a detective inspector himself. | Question: In the Inspector Morse series what is the christian name of Sergeant Lewis\' wife ?', ['valerie'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7178'), ('Context: Machete (character)  Isador Cortez, also known as Machete, is a fictional character in the four "Spy Kids" films, the "Grindhouse" fake trailer, and the "Machete" and "Machete Kills" films.

The "sidekick" to Morse, Lewis is a Detective Sergeant in the Thames Valley Police, and appears in all 13 Morse novels. In the television adaptation, Inspector Morse, he is played by Kevin Whately. Following the conclusion of the series, Whately reprised the role as the lead character in Lewis, in which the character has been promoted to Inspector.  Character history  Inspector Morse (TV and novels)  Lewis is a sergeant on the staff of the Thames Valley Police in Oxford, England, and in Inspector Morse is assistant to the titular Detective Chief Inspector Morse. Although Lewis\'s given name is Robert (Robbie), he was rarely referred to as anything but "Sergeant Lewis" or "Lewis."  The background and personality of Lewis\xa0– a working class, easygoing family man with a Geordie accent (in the TV series; he is Welsh in the novels)\xa0– is frequently contrasted with that of Morse\xa0– Oxford educated, RP-accented, lifetime bachelor. Morse frequently uses these differences to insult or demean Lewis, perhaps from Morse\'s point of view in a playful manner, but Lewis is often not amused by the jabs. In his frustration, Lewis is often more in step with their joint superior Chief Superintendent Strange, himself an evident supporter of Lewis; however, despite a great respect towards Strange, Lewis is always unflinchingly loyal to Morse and follows his lead.  One notable difference between the Lewis from the novels and Whately\'s portrayal is that Lewis in the novels is an older man in his early sixties. When Whately auditioned for the role and then learned this fact, he considered it unlikely that he would get the part. However, Colin Dexter has consistently stated that the younger Lewis is an improvement on the character he originally created, and that if he could start the novels afresh he would begin with Lewis as he is seen in the television adaptation.  In Inspector Morse, Lewis is often shown following a hunch that Morse criticises, and in the end Lewis is usually proved correct, or at least more correct than Morse. Near the end of the television series, Lewis moves on in his career and takes a promotion. With the end of Inspector Morse and the death of its star, John Thaw, Lewis\'s adventures had seemed to come to an end.  In the episode "The Dead of Jericho", Lewis tells Morse "It\'s also my birthday". The first victim is killed on 11 June, and this utterance occurs a few days to a week later. This puts Lewis\' birthday in mid-June.  Lewis does not make an appearance in the episode "The Wench is Dead", as he is out of town on an inspector\'s course.  Lewis  In the pilot episode, Lewis returns to Oxford from a two-year stint training police in the British Virgin Islands, following the death of his wife Valerie in a hit-and-run accident. Lewis still must work partly in the shadow of the now-five-years-dead Inspector Morse, who some time prior to his death had worked a case involving one of the murder suspects as a juvenile. In the new series, Lewis gains his own junior, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (played by Laurence Fox), a Cambridge-educated man who joined the police after giving up training for the priesthood. Another staple of the series, pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (played by Clare Holman), appears late in the Morse series, and continues on through all of the Lewis episodes as a witty part of the team, with a cynical sense of humour and as a romantic interest to him.  The popularity of the one-off episode spurred the continuation of the story into a total of nine series comprising 33 episodes, the most recent airing in 2015. In the latest series, Lewis had retired from the police force, but is brought back as a consultant to work with Hathaway, who is now a detective inspector himself. | Question: In the Inspector Morse series what is the christian name of Sergeant Lewis\' wife ?', ['valerie'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7178'), ('Context: Machete (character)  Isador Cortez, also known as Machete, is a fictional character in the four "Spy Kids" films, the "Grindhouse" fake trailer, and the "Machete" and "Machete Kills" films.

The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau’s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, “Resign.” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is “the voice of the people,” as it is often called, shouldn’t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is “liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.” Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said.

In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth.  If the citizen\'s heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire.  Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal.  Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin .  A damned human "in damnation" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God\'s favor.  In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.   Ancient Egyptian religion  Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.  It centered on the Egyptians\' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.

Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.

Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

This event was held at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  This series of poker tournaments culminated with a $10,000 no-limit Texas hold \'em championship tournament televised by ESPN.  The last time this tournament series was run was 2010.   Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)  Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt. Rushmore, with its gigantic open-air sculpture of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and T. Roosevelt, is famous throughout the world (see Mount Rushmore National Memorial ).
