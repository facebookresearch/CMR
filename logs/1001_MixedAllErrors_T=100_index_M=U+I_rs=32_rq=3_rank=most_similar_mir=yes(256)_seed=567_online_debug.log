She frequently injects herself into her children 's lives , often to their embarrassment , and is supremely confident in their abilities .   Sean Giambrone as Adam Fredrick Goldberg , the pop - culture obsessed youngest child of the Goldbergs . Smart and geeky , he often films his family 's activities on a VHS camcorder . He often ends up having to use his middle initial to distinguish himself from another Adam Goldberg who attends the same school and is also an aspiring filmmaker .   Patton Oswalt voices the adult Adam Goldberg , who narrates the show from the present day .     Jeff Garlin as Murray Goldberg , the gruff , somewhat asocial patriarch of the Goldbergs . Unlike Beverly , he is realistic about his children 's abilities and believes she smothers them too much . Despite his apathetic tendencies at home , he values hard work and has held various full time positions since his teenage years . Though he does not always show affection for his children , calling them morons when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways , he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves . He runs his father - in - law 's furniture business , loves sports , and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his white briefs .   Troy Gentile as Barry Norman Goldberg , the overconfident , slightly dim - witted middle child of the Goldbergs . Though seemingly untalented in every way ( except in ice hockey and wrestling , at which he excels ) , he remains highly self - assured while trying to become popular in high school . He is determined to dominate everything he does , including sports ; loves rap music ; and is the leader of a crew called the Jenkintown Posse ( abbreviated JTP , which fellow members repeat whenever the initials are spoken ) .   Hayley Orrantia as Erica Dorothy Goldberg , the somewhat bad - tempered oldest child of the Goldbergs . Smart and musically gifted but rebellious , she is popular in school and dominant over her younger brothers . As of the fifth season , Erica has left for college at DC . School of the Arts . `` Erica '' is based on Adam 's real - life brother , Eric Goldberg .   George Segal as Albert `` Pops '' Solomon , Beverly 's laid - back widower father . Though an elderly man with a number of comic eccentricities , he acts much younger than his age and often gives sage advice to his grandchildren . Adam considers him his best friend . He once owned a successful furniture store called Ottoman Empire that allowed him to retire comfortably , and he now lets his son - in - law Murray run the business .   AJ Michalka as Lainey Lewis ( Season 3 -- 4 ; recurring 1 -- 2 , 5 - present ) , Erica 's best friend and one of the most popular girls at school , whom Barry has had a lifelong crush on . To the surprise of many , Lainey kisses Barry at a party in the first - season finale , the two slowly grow closer together in season two , and eventually become an unlikely couple . Following the fourth season , she has gone to attend fashion school in Savannah , Georgia and ended her relationship with Barry . In season 5 , she returns to Jenkintown after dropping out along with Erica to start a band . In the final seconds of the season finale she and Barry agree to wed .   Sam Lerner as ' Madman ' Geoff Schwartz ( Season 5 - present ; recurring 2 - 4 ) , one of Barry 's best friends . The nickname `` Madman '' is a form of ironic humor , given how well - behaved the character is , especially compared to Barry . He is infatuated with Erica and makes many futile attempts to win her affections . At the end of the third season , he begins dating Evelyn Silver just as Erica realizes she reciprocates Geoff 's feelings . He later breaks up with Evey to be with Erica . | Question: who does the voice over in the goldbergs ?", ['Patton Oswalt'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-64638'), ("Context: Cap'n Crunch : The original Cap'n Crunch cereal is made of sweetened , yellow , square - shaped cereal pieces made by combining corn and oats . The cereal was launched in 1963 , bolstered by a successful advertising campaign created by noted animator Jay Ward introducing the cereal 's longtime naval mascot , Cap'n Crunch .   Cap'n Crunch 's Crunch Berries : Cap'n Crunch 's Crunch Berries cereal was introduced in 1967 and contained , in addition to the yellow pieces found in the original Cap'n Crunch , spherical red Crunch Berry pieces .

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper Mérimée\'s novella Carmen.

In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C.

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper Mérimée\'s novella Carmen.  Mérimée\'s story is a blend of travelogue and adventure yarn, | Question: Who wrote the opera Carmen?', ['bizet'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2722'), ("Context: Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh . When creating the character , screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite . Wasikowska read Carroll 's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role . She also watched Jan Švankmajer 's Alice . She said , `` When we were kids , my mum would pop it in the VCR player . We would be disturbed , and would n't really understand it , but we could n't look away because it was too intriguing . So I had kept that feeling about Alice , a kind of haunting feeling . '' Although facing pressures to conform to society 's expectations , Alice grows into a stronger - willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path ; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls , describing the character as `` stubborn , brave , ( and ) non-girlie '' . Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six - year - old girl .   Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp , The Mad Hatter . Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character . '' The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt ; Depp believes that the character `` was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair , through his fingernails and eyes '' . Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C. Nesbitt character ) reflecting a darker , more dangerous personality . Illusionary dancer David `` Elsewhere '' Bernal doubled for Depp during the `` Futterwacken '' sequence near the end of the film .   Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims , the Red Queen . She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters : the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts . Her first name is a play on the word irascible because she is easily irritated , obstreperous , impatient , and quick to anger . Bonham Carter 's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen . The character hates animals , and chooses to use them as servants and furniture . It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband , the King . The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell , a toddler , stating that , `` The Red Queen is just like a toddler , because she 's got a big head and she 's a tyrant . ''   Anne Hathaway as Mirana of Marmoreal , the White Queen . She was one of few characters that did not require digital manipulation . Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife ; `` Cute but psycho . Things even out . '' According to Hathaway , `` She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen . She really likes the dark side , but she 's so scared of going too far into it that she 's made everything appear very light and happy . But she 's living in that place out of fear that she wo n't be able to control herself . '' Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as `` a punk - rock vegan pacifist '' , with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry , Greta Garbo , and the artwork of Dan Flavin . Burton said that the White Queen 's appearance was inspired by Nigella Lawson .

This is a translation of the Latin phrase dies Solis . English , like most of the Germanic languages , preserves the original pagan / sun associations of the day . Many other European languages , including all of the Romance languages , have changed its name to the equivalent of `` the Lord 's day '' ( based on Ecclesiastical Latin dies Dominica ) . In both West Germanic and North Germanic mythology the Sun is personified as Sunna / Sól .   Monday : Old English Mōnandæg ( pronounced ( ˈmoːnɑndæj ) ) , meaning `` Moon 's day '' . This is equivalent to the Latin name dies lunae . In North Germanic mythology , the Moon is personified as Máni .   Tuesday : Old English Tīwesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈtiːwezdæj ) ) , meaning `` Tiw 's day '' . Tiw ( Norse Týr ) was a one - handed god associated with single combat and pledges in Norse mythology and also attested prominently in wider Germanic paganism . The name of the day is also related to the Latin name dies Martis , `` Day of Mars '' .   Wednesday : Old English Wōdnesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈwoːdnezdæj ) ) meaning the day of the Germanic god Woden ( known as Óðinn among the North Germanic peoples ) , and a prominent god of the Anglo - Saxons ( and other Germanic peoples ) in England until about the seventh century . It is also vaguely related to the Latin counterpartdies Mercurii , `` Day of Mercury '' . The connection between Mercury and Odin is more strained than the other syncretic connections . The usual explanation is that both Wodan and Mercury were considered psychopomps , or guides of souls after death , in their respective mythologies ; both are also associated with poetic and musical inspiration . The Icelandic Miðviku , German Mittwoch , Low German Middeweek and Finnish keskiviikko all mean mid-week .   Thursday : Old English Þūnresdæg ( pronounced ( ˈθuːnrezdæj ) ) , meaning ' Þunor 's day ' . Þunor means thunder or its personification , the Norse god known in Modern English as Thor . Similarly Dutch donderdag , German Donnerstag ( ' thunder 's day ' ) , Finnish torstai , and Scandinavian Torsdag ( ' Thor 's day ' ) . Thor 's day corresponds to Latin dies Iovis , `` day of Jupiter '' .   Friday : Old English Frīgedæg ( pronounced ( ˈfriːjedæj ) ) , meaning the day of the Anglo - Saxon goddess Fríge . The Norse name for the planet Venus was Friggjarstjarna , ' Frigg 's star ' . It is based on the Latin dies Veneris , `` Day of Venus '' .   Saturday : the only day of the week to retain its Roman origin in English , named after the Roman god Saturn associated with the Titan Cronus , father of Zeus and many Olympians . Its original Anglo - Saxon rendering was Sæturnesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈsæturnezdæj ) ) . In Latin , it was dies Saturni , `` Day of Saturn '' . The Scandinavian Lørdag / Lördag deviates significantly as it has no reference to either the Norse or the Roman pantheon ; it derives from old Norse laugardagr , literally `` washing - day '' . The German Sonnabend ( mainly used in northern and eastern Germany ) and the Low German words Sünnavend mean `` Sunday Eve '' , the German word Samstag ( mainly used in southern and western Germany ) derives from the name for Shabbat . | Question: where did the days of the week originate from ?", ['Tiw'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-54223'), ("Context: Hugh Jackman as P.T.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: In telecommunications , a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity .

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: In telecommunications , a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity .

You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

He has been growing and nurturing a rare night - blooming orchid for about forty years especially for it . Despite the investment , the flower dies shortly after it blooms .

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.  Postcards from Paradise is officially out on March 31. For more on Ringo visit ringostarr.com .

When the bacteria invade the body, they produce a poison (toxin) that causes painful muscle contractions. Another name for tetanus is "lockjaw" because it often causes a person\'s neck and jaw muscles to lock, making it hard to open the mouth or swallow. Vaccines are recommended for infants, children, teens, and adults to prevent tetanus.  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical ...Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Tetanus+disease  \xa0  Definition  Tetanus is a rare but often fatal disease that affects the central nervous system by causing painful muscular contractions. It begins when tetanus bacteria enter the body, usually through a wound or cut exposed to contaminated soil. Tetanus is easily preventable through vaccination .  Description  Tetanus is rare in the United States, with nearly all cases occurring in adults who were not vaccinated as children. About 100 cases are reported each year; 63% of these occur in people over the age of 50. The number of tetanus cases in the United States has steadily decreased since the 1940s (500 to 600 cases per year); the number of reported cases has remained at approximately 50 to 100 cases per year since the mid-1970s. In 1999, however, the lowest number of annual cases to date was reported (33, or 0.02 per 100,000).  Tetanus causes convulsive muscle spasms and rigidity that can lead to respiratory paralysis and death . It is sometimes called "lockjaw" because one of the most common symptoms is a stiff jaw, unable to be opened. Sometimes, tetanus affects only the part of the body where the infection began, but in almost all of reported cases, it spreads to the entire body. The incubation period from the time of the injury until the first symptoms appear ranges from two to 50 days. Symptoms usually occur within five to 10 days. When symptoms occur early, the chance of death is increased. Tetanus is not contagious.  Causes and symptoms  Tetanus is caused by a bacteria called Clostridium tetani, whose spores (the dormant form) are found in soil, street dust, and animal (or even human) feces. Tetanus spores germinate in the body, producing a highly poisonous neurotoxin in the blood, spreading to the nervous system. The infection is usually transmitted through deep puncture wounds or cuts or scratches that are not cleaned well. Between 1997 and 1999, approximately 64% of tetanus cases in the United States were associated with such wounds as punctures, lacerations, or abrasions. Many people associate tetanus with rusty nails and other dirty objects, but any wound can be a source. Less common ways of getting tetanus are animal scratches and bites, surgical wounds, dental work, and therapeutic abortion. About 18% of cases reported between 1997 and 1999 were a result of intravenous drug use. Cases have also been reported in people with no known wound or medical condition.  The first symptom of tetanus is often a stiff or "locked" jaw that prevents the patient from opening his/her mouth or swallowing. This is also called trismus and results in a facial expression called a sardonic smile (or risus sardonicus). Stiffness of the neck and other muscles throughout the body and uncontrollable spasms often follow. Sometimes these convulsions are severe enough to cause broken bones. The bacterial toxin (tetanospasmin) affects the nerve endings, causing a continuous stimulation of muscles. Other symptoms include irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, and drooling. People with tetanus that is localized experience pain and tingling only at the wound site and spasms in nearby muscles.  In the underdeveloped world, neonatal tetanus accounts for about one-half of tetanus deaths and is related to infection of the umbilical stump in a baby born of an unimmunized mother.

When the bacteria invade the body, they produce a poison (toxin) that causes painful muscle contractions. Another name for tetanus is "lockjaw" because it often causes a person\'s neck and jaw muscles to lock, making it hard to open the mouth or swallow. Vaccines are recommended for infants, children, teens, and adults to prevent tetanus.  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical ...Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Tetanus+disease  \xa0  Definition  Tetanus is a rare but often fatal disease that affects the central nervous system by causing painful muscular contractions. It begins when tetanus bacteria enter the body, usually through a wound or cut exposed to contaminated soil. Tetanus is easily preventable through vaccination .  Description  Tetanus is rare in the United States, with nearly all cases occurring in adults who were not vaccinated as children. About 100 cases are reported each year; 63% of these occur in people over the age of 50. The number of tetanus cases in the United States has steadily decreased since the 1940s (500 to 600 cases per year); the number of reported cases has remained at approximately 50 to 100 cases per year since the mid-1970s. In 1999, however, the lowest number of annual cases to date was reported (33, or 0.02 per 100,000).  Tetanus causes convulsive muscle spasms and rigidity that can lead to respiratory paralysis and death . It is sometimes called "lockjaw" because one of the most common symptoms is a stiff jaw, unable to be opened. Sometimes, tetanus affects only the part of the body where the infection began, but in almost all of reported cases, it spreads to the entire body. The incubation period from the time of the injury until the first symptoms appear ranges from two to 50 days. Symptoms usually occur within five to 10 days. When symptoms occur early, the chance of death is increased. Tetanus is not contagious.  Causes and symptoms  Tetanus is caused by a bacteria called Clostridium tetani, whose spores (the dormant form) are found in soil, street dust, and animal (or even human) feces. Tetanus spores germinate in the body, producing a highly poisonous neurotoxin in the blood, spreading to the nervous system. The infection is usually transmitted through deep puncture wounds or cuts or scratches that are not cleaned well. Between 1997 and 1999, approximately 64% of tetanus cases in the United States were associated with such wounds as punctures, lacerations, or abrasions. Many people associate tetanus with rusty nails and other dirty objects, but any wound can be a source. Less common ways of getting tetanus are animal scratches and bites, surgical wounds, dental work, and therapeutic abortion. About 18% of cases reported between 1997 and 1999 were a result of intravenous drug use. Cases have also been reported in people with no known wound or medical condition.  The first symptom of tetanus is often a stiff or "locked" jaw that prevents the patient from opening his/her mouth or swallowing. This is also called trismus and results in a facial expression called a sardonic smile (or risus sardonicus). Stiffness of the neck and other muscles throughout the body and uncontrollable spasms often follow. Sometimes these convulsions are severe enough to cause broken bones. The bacterial toxin (tetanospasmin) affects the nerve endings, causing a continuous stimulation of muscles. Other symptoms include irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, and drooling. People with tetanus that is localized experience pain and tingling only at the wound site and spasms in nearby muscles.  In the underdeveloped world, neonatal tetanus accounts for about one-half of tetanus deaths and is related to infection of the umbilical stump in a baby born of an unimmunized mother.

After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database. There is no transcript for a trial of a Sweeney Todd, nor for that matter any similar crimes.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Nicknamed “The Tin Man”, and described as “as the best all-round jockey that the turf has ever seen”, Archer was the holder of several records which lasted deep into the 20th century. He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, claiming 2,748 victories from 8,064 starts. He won a total of 21 classic races, including Epson Derby five times. He committed suicide at the age of 29 after the loss of his wife during childbirth.  Sir Gordon Richards (5 May 1904 – 10 November 1986) was one of the England’s finest jockeys, often considered the world’s greatest ever jockey. He is still the only jockey to have been knighted. Gordon Richard was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times. He amassed a total of 4,870 winners, and a record 12 consecutive winners ridden. In 1999, the Racing Post (leading racing newspaper in Britain) placed him at number 1 in their list of the top 50 jockeys of 20th century.  Lester Piggott (born 5 November 1935) – is a retired professional jockey and one of the most successful English flat racing jockeys of all time. Nicknamed “The Long Fellow” to his height, Lester Piggott introduced a new style of race-riding that was adopted all over the world and enabled him to become Champion Jockey eleven times. Piggott boasts 4,493 career wins including 30 British classics.  William Lee “Bill” Shoemaker (August 19, 1931 – October 12, 2003) is one of the all-time legends who have graced the sport. Referred to as “The Shoe”, he held the world record of number of professional jockey victories for 29 years. Shoemaker used his small size (1.50 m) to his advantage riding 8,833 winners. A high school dropout, Shoemaker went to ride a total of 40,350 races, and win the United States Champion Jockey by earnings , a record 10 times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1958.  Russell Avery Braze (born 7 August 1958) is the record holder of the most race wins in North American horse racing history . He’s victory counter stopped at the astonishing 12,007 number. Baze won 400 or more races per year for four consecutive years and got rewarded with a special Eclipse Award in 1995. Since then he has on over 400 races a year seven additional times; an achievement that no other jockey has accomplished more than three times. Russell Baze was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. He also received the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 2002.  Julieann Louise “Julie” Krone (born July 24, 1963) is one of the most successful female jockeys in North American horse racing history. Julie became the first female to win a Triple Crown Race when she claimed the Belmont Stakes, riding on Colonial Affair. She sustained number of severe injuries while racing, but always came back stronger. Because of her never give up attitude, Krone was named by USA Today as one of the 10 Toughest Athletes and was honored with the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award by the Women’s Sports Foundation.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: Aaron, Brother of Moses - The Church of Jesus Christ of ...Aaron, Brother of Moses  Aaron, Brother of Moses  See also Aaronic Priesthood ; Moses  In the Old Testament, a son of Amram and Jochebed, of the tribe of Levi ( Ex. 6:16–20 ); the elder brother of Moses ( Ex. 7:7 ).

Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic . Towards the end of this era , in 44 BC , Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated . The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar 's adopted son Octavian . Antony and Octavian 's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian 's forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ( `` first citizen '' ) with proconsular imperium , thus beginning the Principate ( the first epoch of Roman imperial history , usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284 ) , and gave him the name `` Augustus '' ( `` the venerated '' ) . Though the old constitutional machinery remained in place , Augustus came to predominate it . Although the republic stood in name , contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome . Since his rule ended a century of civil wars and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity , he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure . During the years of his rule , a new constitutional order emerged ( in part organically and in part by design ) , so that , upon his death , this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new emperor . The 200 years that began with Augustus 's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ( `` Roman Peace '' ) . During this period , the cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced .

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R. Mead, an associate of Jesse Chisholm in the early-day trading business.

The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002, before being revived by the same channel in 2006 under the title of All Star Family Fortunes . The game involves two families providing answers to \'everyday questions\' that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show (e.g. \'Name something usually done in the dark\') to win cash prizes (and sometimes mystery prizes for giving a correct answer). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, originally known as "Mr. Babbage", which famously sounds a wrong answer "Eh-uhh" sound effect and its accompanying X to signal the strike, as well as a "ding" for a right answer).  Contents  11 External links  Hosts and presentation[ edit ]  Family Fortunes was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980–83) then by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983–85). After being rested for the whole of 1986, the show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter, and had a consistently successful run for the next 15 years. It was then moved out of peak time and became a daily daytime show, hosted by Andy Collins , but it only had a short run in this format before being axed.  In 2006, the series was revived with Vernon Kay as host, and was renamed All Star Family Fortunes , as each team consisted of a celebrity and four family members. The show was also transmitted back to peak time. Prize money goes to a charity of the celebrity\'s choice, and contestants being either celebrity families, or a group of actors famous for playing a fictional family. Several Christmas specials of All Star Family Fortunes have aired as well.  The most iconic aspects of the show are the large computer screen, named "Mr Babbage" by original host Bob Monkhouse and the famous computerised "Eh-uhh" sound used when wrong answers are given. Both were originally designed to appear high-tech but have since become fondly regarded for being quite the opposite (as compared to the original US Feud, which has used a video board since its 1999 revival). The computer screen name "Mr Babbage" was in recognition to the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer, Charles Babbage .  Format[ edit ]  Two family teams, each with five members, are asked to guess the results of surveys, in which 100 people would be asked open ended questions (e.g. "we asked 100 people to name something associated with the country Wales" or "we asked 100 people to name a breed of dog"). Although rarely acknowledged in the show, the 100 people surveyed are invariably audience members who have volunteered before the show.  Each round begins with a member of each family (in rotation, meaning all players do this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question is read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the most popular answer, the other nominee is asked. The family with the more popular answer then chooses whether to "play" the question, or "pass" control to the other family.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database. There is no transcript for a trial of a Sweeney Todd, nor for that matter any similar crimes.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, claiming 2,748 victories from 8,064 starts. He won a total of 21 classic races, including Epson Derby five times. He committed suicide at the age of 29 after the loss of his wife during childbirth.

Gordon Richard was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times. He amassed a total of 4,870 winners, and a record 12 consecutive winners ridden. In 1999, the Racing Post (leading racing newspaper in Britain) placed him at number 1 in their list of the top 50 jockeys of 20th century.

Baze won 400 or more races per year for four consecutive years and got rewarded with a special Eclipse Award in 1995. Since then he has on over 400 races a year seven additional times; an achievement that no other jockey has accomplished more than three times.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.

Discovering the Biblical Moses  Read Peter Machinist’s article “The Man Moses” as it originally appeared in Bible Review, April 2000. The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic . Towards the end of this era , in 44 BC , Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated . The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar 's adopted son Octavian . Antony and Octavian 's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian 's forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ( `` first citizen '' ) with proconsular imperium , thus beginning the Principate ( the first epoch of Roman imperial history , usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284 ) , and gave him the name `` Augustus '' ( `` the venerated '' ) .

Although the republic stood in name , contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome .

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R. Mead, an associate of Jesse Chisholm in the early-day trading business.

The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002, before being revived by the same channel in 2006 under the title of All Star Family Fortunes . The game involves two families providing answers to \'everyday questions\' that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show (e.g. \'Name something usually done in the dark\') to win cash prizes (and sometimes mystery prizes for giving a correct answer). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, originally known as "Mr. Babbage", which famously sounds a wrong answer "Eh-uhh" sound effect and its accompanying X to signal the strike, as well as a "ding" for a right answer).  Contents  11 External links  Hosts and presentation[ edit ]  Family Fortunes was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980–83) then by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983–85). After being rested for the whole of 1986, the show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter, and had a consistently successful run for the next 15 years. It was then moved out of peak time and became a daily daytime show, hosted by Andy Collins , but it only had a short run in this format before being axed.  In 2006, the series was revived with Vernon Kay as host, and was renamed All Star Family Fortunes , as each team consisted of a celebrity and four family members. The show was also transmitted back to peak time. Prize money goes to a charity of the celebrity\'s choice, and contestants being either celebrity families, or a group of actors famous for playing a fictional family. Several Christmas specials of All Star Family Fortunes have aired as well.  The most iconic aspects of the show are the large computer screen, named "Mr Babbage" by original host Bob Monkhouse and the famous computerised "Eh-uhh" sound used when wrong answers are given. Both were originally designed to appear high-tech but have since become fondly regarded for being quite the opposite (as compared to the original US Feud, which has used a video board since its 1999 revival). The computer screen name "Mr Babbage" was in recognition to the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer, Charles Babbage .  Format[ edit ]  Two family teams, each with five members, are asked to guess the results of surveys, in which 100 people would be asked open ended questions (e.g. "we asked 100 people to name something associated with the country Wales" or "we asked 100 people to name a breed of dog"). Although rarely acknowledged in the show, the 100 people surveyed are invariably audience members who have volunteered before the show.  Each round begins with a member of each family (in rotation, meaning all players do this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question is read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the most popular answer, the other nominee is asked. The family with the more popular answer then chooses whether to "play" the question, or "pass" control to the other family.  The host then passes down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each. After each answer, the board reveals whether this answer featured. If not, the family is assessed a strike, and the family loses control of the board after accumulating three strikes (also referred as striking out) in the round. If a family manages to come up with all the survey answers (most commonly six in the early part of the show, reduced in number after the commercial break) before striking out, they win the amount in pounds of the total | Question: Who presented Family Fortunes in the two years between Bob Monkhouse and Les Dennis?', ['max bygraves'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-287'), ('Context: Pirate activity in and around the area left its trace in English literature .

George Washington sometimes used some sort of unconventional methods to fight the British .

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.  Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become \'\'a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,\'\' the Prince said, \'\'I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.\'\' But then he added, \'\'Look, if a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which | Question: "Who famously said after the \'Dunblane Massacre\', ""If a cricketer for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats""?" ?', ['duke of edinburgh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6259'), ("Context: A fee of $40,000 ( as of 2018 ) , payable at time of selection , is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star , as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK).

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.  Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become \'\'a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,\'\' the Prince said, \'\'I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.\'\' But then he added, \'\'Look, if a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which | Question: "Who famously said after the \'Dunblane Massacre\', ""If a cricketer for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats""?" ?', ['duke of edinburgh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6259'), ("Context: A fee of $40,000 ( as of 2018 ) , payable at time of selection , is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star , as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK).

Victor Emmanuel III of Italy  Victor Emmanuel III (Italian: "Vittorio Emanuele III" , Albanian: "Viktor Emanueli III" ; 11 November 1869 – 28 December 1947) was the King of Italy from 29 July 1900 until his abdication on 9 May 1946.  In addition, he claimed the thrones of Ethiopia and Albania as Emperor of Ethiopia (1936–41) and King of the Albanians (1939–43), claims not recognised by the other great powers.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.  In June 1992, the High Court of Australia overturned the previous concept of terra nullius which stated that, in legal terms, Australia was empty of inhabitants when it was first settled by Europeans | Question: What is Australia's largest island?", ['tasmania'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3945'), ("Context: The Roman Empire ( Latin : Imperium Rōmānum , Classical Latin : ( ɪmˈpɛ. ri. ũː roːˈmaː. nũː ) ; Koine and Medieval Greek : Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων , tr .

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: byker grove : definition of byker grove and synonyms of ...byker grove : definition of byker grove and synonyms of byker grove (English)  10 External links  \xa0 Creation  The show ran between 1989 and 2006, and was set in a youth club in the Byker district of Newcastle upon Tyne , England.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

His reign also encompassed the birth, rise, and fall of Italian Fascism. | Question: When was the father of Princess Mafalda of Savoy born ?', ['11 November 1869'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-984'), ("Context: Australian islands | australia.gov.auAustralian islands | australia.gov.au  Australian islands  Australian islands  World Heritage-listed Fraser Island. Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.  In June 1992, the High Court of Australia overturned the previous concept of terra nullius which stated that, in legal terms, Australia was empty of inhabitants when it was first settled by Europeans | Question: What is Australia's largest island?", ['tasmania'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3945'), ("Context: The Roman Empire ( Latin : Imperium Rōmānum , Classical Latin : ( ɪmˈpɛ. ri. ũː roːˈmaː. nũː ) ; Koine and Medieval Greek : Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων , tr .

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

Founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson who, after Byker Grove, became executive producer of EastEnders , Head of Drama BBC Wales and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia . It was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen Mamma Mia , the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham ( This Life , Doctor Who and co-creator of BBC One\'s Life on Mars ). The first writer was Adele Rose - in Series 1 she wrote eps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, her daughter, Carrie Rose, writing ep 5 - and the most prolific was Brian B.

Byker Grove was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle . The actual youth club set was in Benwell , which is in the west area of the City, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne & Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the famous architecture that is the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) are used for filming backdrops.  The "youth club" building which is what the viewers see onscreen, known as The Mitre used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 90s) before it was bought by Zenith Television , who film the series. The building housed the actual set, production offices, make up suite and costume department. Currently the property is semi-vacant, and the Zenith North Television signs have been removed outside the building.  The final series started on 7 October 2006 on the CBBC Channel. Richard Deverell , head of CBBC, was interviewed on Newsround about the decision to axe Byker Grove. [2]  The eighteenth and last series of Byker Grove was produced by Tim Holloway, who also produced Casualty from 2000 until 2002.  On 11 March 2008, it was reported that Gallowgate Productions TV, the TV production company owned by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, purchased the rights to Byker Grove after the production company that made it ( Zenith Entertainment ) went into liquidation in 2007.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074'), ("Context: Castle of Otranto, The (unabridged) – Naxos AudioBooksCastle of Otranto, The  (unabridged) – Naxos AudioBooks  The Castle of Otranto (unabridged)  Booklet Notes  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.

It is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory . The island is located in the Indian Ocean , about 1,600\xa0km (1,000\xa0mi) south of the southern coast of India . [3] The closest other countries to Diego Garcia are Sri Lanka and Maldives .  In the 1960s, the Chagos archipelago was secretly leased to the United Kingdom and detached from Mauritius with the intention of expelling its entire population and establishing a military base. In 1971 the United Kingdom and United States entered an agreement under which the latter would set up a military base in Diego Garcia.  Since then, the United Kingdom enforced the highly controversial depopulation of Diego Garcia , forcing the deportation of all 2,000 inhabitants of the island, who were descendants of African slaves and Hindu labourers brought to the islands by the French in the 18th century, to the surrounding islands, including Mauritius, located 1,200 miles away. In their place, a joint British-American military base was established.

The atoll forms a nearly complete rim of land around a lagoon, enclosing 90 percent of its perimeter , with an opening only in the north.

The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074'), ("Context: Castle of Otranto, The (unabridged) – Naxos AudioBooksCastle of Otranto, The  (unabridged) – Naxos AudioBooks  The Castle of Otranto (unabridged)  Booklet Notes  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.

It is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory . The island is located in the Indian Ocean , about 1,600\xa0km (1,000\xa0mi) south of the southern coast of India . [3] The closest other countries to Diego Garcia are Sri Lanka and Maldives .  In the 1960s, the Chagos archipelago was secretly leased to the United Kingdom and detached from Mauritius with the intention of expelling its entire population and establishing a military base. In 1971 the United Kingdom and United States entered an agreement under which the latter would set up a military base in Diego Garcia.  Since then, the United Kingdom enforced the highly controversial depopulation of Diego Garcia , forcing the deportation of all 2,000 inhabitants of the island, who were descendants of African slaves and Hindu labourers brought to the islands by the French in the 18th century, to the surrounding islands, including Mauritius, located 1,200 miles away. In their place, a joint British-American military base was established.  This island has one of the five monitoring stations assisting the operation of the Global Positioning System , the others being on Ascension Island , Hawaii , Kwajalein Atoll and in Colorado Springs .  It is covered in luxuriant tropical vegetation. It is 60\xa0kilometres (37\xa0mi) long, with a maximum elevation of 6.7\xa0metres (22\xa0ft), and nearly encloses a lagoon about 19\xa0kilometres (12\xa0mi) long and up to 8\xa0kilometres (5.0\xa0mi) wide.

The channel and anchorage area are dredged , while the old turning basin can also be used.  Contents  Geography  Location map of Diego Garcia.  The atoll forms a nearly complete rim of land around a lagoon, enclosing 90 percent of its perimeter , with an opening only in the north. The main island is the largest of about sixty islands which form the Chagos Archipelago.

The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

He soon hooked up with Alison Moyet , an R&B singer with a powerful deep alto, and started recording as Yazoo . (In the U.S., after the blues record label Yazoo sued them, they were known as Yaz.) The first Yazoo single, "Only You" b/w "Situation," was a double-sided smash, and their debut, Upstairs at Eric\'s (named after Mute Records\' head Eric Radcliffe) went gold in the U.K. After they finished recording their second album, You and Me Both, Clarke opted out of the group. Yazoo was the template for Erasure , Clarke\'s long-running collaboration with diva Andy Bell , and numerous new bands that blended dance-pop and synthesizers. In 2008, Clarke and Moyet united for a tour of the U.K., Europe, and North America. The concerts were recorded and the result is this two-CD set. Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance. At the end of "State Farm," the funky white-girl rap from You and Me Both that kicks off side two of the set, Moyet laughs with almost girlish delight at the crowd\'s enthusiastic reaction. The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts. There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along. The sound on the set is a bit muddy, but the duo\'s enthusiastic performance more than makes up for the sonic limitations. ~ j. poet  Reconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusicReconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Reconnected: Live  google+  AllMusic Review                             by j. poet  In the early \'80s, Vince Clarke quit Depeche Mode , allegedly dissatisfied with their move toward pop music.

The judge may impose fines and jail time upon any person committing contempt of court . The person is usually let out upon his or her agreement to fulfill the wishes of the court . Civil contempt can involve acts of omission . The judge will make use of warnings in most situations that may lead to a person being charged with contempt . It is relatively rare that a person is charged for contempt without first receiving at least one warning from the judge .

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences! That\'s not fair, is it!  This message has been edited. Last edited by: Izzy loves you all ,  Izzy loves you all  \xa0  I don\'t agree that Americans always want to be different from the British.  It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.

She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

He soon hooked up with Alison Moyet , an R&B singer with a powerful deep alto, and started recording as Yazoo . (In the U.S., after the blues record label Yazoo sued them, they were known as Yaz.) The first Yazoo single, "Only You" b/w "Situation," was a double-sided smash, and their debut, Upstairs at Eric\'s (named after Mute Records\' head Eric Radcliffe) went gold in the U.K. After they finished recording their second album, You and Me Both, Clarke opted out of the group. Yazoo was the template for Erasure , Clarke\'s long-running collaboration with diva Andy Bell , and numerous new bands that blended dance-pop and synthesizers. In 2008, Clarke and Moyet united for a tour of the U.K., Europe, and North America. The concerts were recorded and the result is this two-CD set. Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance. At the end of "State Farm," the funky white-girl rap from You and Me Both that kicks off side two of the set, Moyet laughs with almost girlish delight at the crowd\'s enthusiastic reaction. The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts. There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along. The sound on the set is a bit muddy, but the duo\'s enthusiastic performance more than makes up for the sonic limitations. ~ j. poet  Reconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusicReconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Reconnected: Live  google+  AllMusic Review                             by j. poet  In the early \'80s, Vince Clarke quit Depeche Mode , allegedly dissatisfied with their move toward pop music.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences! That\'s not fair, is it!  This message has been edited. Last edited by: Izzy loves you all ,  Izzy loves you all  \xa0  I don\'t agree that Americans always want to be different from the British.  It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.  Still, if some Americans adopt a British accent, and call the letter Z "zed," and an elevator "a lift," the rest of us kind of smile and think the speaker is a | Question: We call it a ‘full stop’ what do Americans call it?', ['period'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1792'), ('Context: Jesus\' Son (film)  Jesus\' Son is a 1999 drama film that was adapted from the eponymous short story collection by Denis Johnson.

The museum was officially launched on Dec.5, with a press conference revealing the complete contents of the 3D application. The virtual museum is the first of its kind and was established after three years of planning by the Italian designer and his business partner Giancarlo Giammetti.  A desktop application, the museum reportedly is the online equivalent of galleries comprising 10,000 square meters of an actual museum. Content is arranged in a museum layout where users explore the different galleries and wings. Around 300 dresses are on display, some of which can be rotated in 3-D. These dresses are paired with the images of the celebrities who wore them.  According to the Wall Street Journal, there is also a collection of videos showing a master-class with the designer, an interview with Giammetti and model Natalia Vodianova with 10 dresses shot in 360 degrees.\xa0  Moreover, there is also a display of special events and exhibitions from the pair\'s history celebrated with photos and video - from the 1968 White Collection to the 2011 White Fairy Tale Love Ball.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Uploaded on Mar 31, 2007  Some clips of a young Catherine Zeta Jones as Mariette, in the tv series, "The Darling Buds of May".  "The Darling Buds of May" was a British television series first broadcast in 1991. It is set in an idyllic rural 1950s Kent, among a large, boisterous family. The show was very popular, and launched the acting career of Catherine Zeta Jones.

Along the way, the 41-year-old has picked up an Oscar, a Tony, a CBE, countless plaudits and a smattering of bad reviews.  She married Hollywood actor Michael Douglas in a lavish New York ceremony in 2000, however the couple have now decided to take some time apart to "evaluate and work on their marriage".  Few could have predicted that a girl born to a sweet factory owner and a seamstress would go on to become one of the most famous actresses in the world.  At the age of 10, the Welsh star won a national talent contest singing a Shirley Bassey song before landing roles in various West End productions.  Image caption Zeta Jones started acting at a very young age  She got her big break at the age of 17, following a promotion from second understudy to the lead role in the hit musical 42nd Street.  But it was Zeta Jones\'s first major TV role, in the 1991 comedy drama The Darling Buds of May, that made her a household name.  Set in rural Kent in the 1950s, viewers fell in love with the Larkins, played by Sir David Jason and Pam Ferris.  Zeta Jones played their fresh-faced sweetheart daughter Mariette.  Squeaky-clean perception  Off camera, her personal life began to hit the headlines more than her acting ability.  Her relationship with Blue Peter presenter John Leslie was well documented. She also became involved with Simply Red star Mick Hucknall and Soldier Soldier actor Angus MacFadyen.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk.

On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Along the way, the 41-year-old has picked up an Oscar, a Tony, a CBE, countless plaudits and a smattering of bad reviews.  She married Hollywood actor Michael Douglas in a lavish New York ceremony in 2000, however the couple have now decided to take some time apart to "evaluate and work on their marriage".  Few could have predicted that a girl born to a sweet factory owner and a seamstress would go on to become one of the most famous actresses in the world.  At the age of 10, the Welsh star won a national talent contest singing a Shirley Bassey song before landing roles in various West End productions.  Image caption Zeta Jones started acting at a very young age  She got her big break at the age of 17, following a promotion from second understudy to the lead role in the hit musical 42nd Street.  But it was Zeta Jones\'s first major TV role, in the 1991 comedy drama The Darling Buds of May, that made her a household name.  Set in rural Kent in the 1950s, viewers fell in love with the Larkins, played by Sir David Jason and Pam Ferris.  Zeta Jones played their fresh-faced sweetheart daughter Mariette.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.

The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ("Context: Habeas corpus ( / ˈheɪbiəs ˈkɔːrpəs / ) is a recourse in law challenging the reasons or conditions of a person 's confinement under color of law .

The year? Any time between the Dark Ages and the 18th century. You have sent your holy relics on a road trip to raise money for a new abbey church. But the best stone for your new church lies over 100 miles away. A hundred miles over roads that are impassable in wet weather and beset by brigands. How do you transport the building materials you need?  A canal aquaduct over the Irwell  The river solution  By river, that\'s how. Until the 18th century most heavy goods were transported within Britain by river. And it isn\'t hard to see why. A healthy horse could pull a cart laden with two tons. That same horse could pull a river barge weighing one hundred tons. But by Tudor times the navigable rivers were gradually silting up. Several acts of Parliament were passed to keep the rivers clean, but by the 18th century the rivers could not keep up with the demands of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. It was time for a change, and canals provided that change.  The Canal solution  The most influential early canal was built by the Duke of Bridgewater in 1759 to carry coal from his mines at Worsely to Manchester. The Duke\'s engineer, James Brindley, became the \'pop star\' of the canal set, and for the next dozen years he was in constant demand to create canals for other entrepreneurs.  Towpaths and locks  Many of these early canals were powered by men, who pulled the barges with ropes from the banks. Later, towpaths were built beside the canals to allow horses to do the work. Most canals simply joined rivers or navigable streams. To counter changes in water levels between these rivers, locks were used, sometimes in flights (there is a flight of 30 at Tardebrigge on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal and 29 at Devizes on the Kennet and Avon).  A traditional narrowboat at  Stoke Bruerne, Northamptonshire  Narrowboats  One of the major difficulties of canal transport was that there were no standards. Canals were built by individual entrepreneurs to take local goods, and each canal was built to its own width and depth. Boats from one area could not fit the canals in another area. To keep costs down many canals were built with locks only 7 feet wide, and the boats just 6 inches narrower than that. These 6\'6" boats are the classic British "narrowboats" that we still see today.  The death of canals... and revival  Railways killed the canals. By the late 1800\'s canals were no longer viable, and many fell into disuse. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in canals for pleasure use. Vacationers in search of the slow lane can rent a narrowboat (don\'t worry, they are very easy to pilot) or stay on a hotel boat for a leisurely cruise - top speed 4 mph! One of the pleasures of canal travel are the lock keeper\'s cottages. It was traditional for lock keepers to try to outdo each other in creating beautiful gardens; there is now a national competition for the best lock-keeper\'s cottage garden.  Canals to visit  A few of the major canals you may wish to visit include Regent\'s Canal in London, the Kennet and Avon, the Shropshire Union, and the Grand Union Canal, among dozens of others. And here\'s one final tidbit of canal trivia you can use as an ice-breaker at your next party : there are more miles of canals in Birmingham than in Venice! Remember, you heard it here first.

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ('Context: There was a pause of uncertain length ( eyewitness estimates ranged from several seconds to two minutes ) , after which the soldiers fired into the crowd .

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals.

After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

The year? Any time between the Dark Ages and the 18th century. You have sent your holy relics on a road trip to raise money for a new abbey church. But the best stone for your new church lies over 100 miles away. A hundred miles over roads that are impassable in wet weather and beset by brigands. How do you transport the building materials you need?  A canal aquaduct over the Irwell  The river solution  By river, that\'s how. Until the 18th century most heavy goods were transported within Britain by river. And it isn\'t hard to see why. A healthy horse could pull a cart laden with two tons. That same horse could pull a river barge weighing one hundred tons. But by Tudor times the navigable rivers were gradually silting up. Several acts of Parliament were passed to keep the rivers clean, but by the 18th century the rivers could not keep up with the demands of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. It was time for a change, and canals provided that change.  The Canal solution  The most influential early canal was built by the Duke of Bridgewater in 1759 to carry coal from his mines at Worsely to Manchester. The Duke\'s engineer, James Brindley, became the \'pop star\' of the canal set, and for the next dozen years he was in constant demand to create canals for other entrepreneurs.  Towpaths and locks  Many of these early canals were powered by men, who pulled the barges with ropes from the banks. Later, towpaths were built beside the canals to allow horses to do the work. Most canals simply joined rivers or navigable streams. To counter changes in water levels between these rivers, locks were used, sometimes in flights (there is a flight of 30 at Tardebrigge on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal and 29 at Devizes on the Kennet and Avon).  A traditional narrowboat at  Stoke Bruerne, Northamptonshire  Narrowboats  One of the major difficulties of canal transport was that there were no standards. Canals were built by individual entrepreneurs to take local goods, and each canal was built to its own width and depth. Boats from one area could not fit the canals in another area. To keep costs down many canals were built with locks only 7 feet wide, and the boats just 6 inches narrower than that. These 6\'6" boats are the classic British "narrowboats" that we still see today.  The death of canals... and revival  Railways killed the canals. By the late 1800\'s canals were no longer viable, and many fell into disuse. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in canals for pleasure use. Vacationers in search of the slow lane can rent a narrowboat (don\'t worry, they are very easy to pilot) or stay on a hotel boat for a leisurely cruise - top speed 4 mph! One of the pleasures of canal travel are the lock keeper\'s cottages. It was traditional for lock keepers to try to outdo each other in creating beautiful gardens; there is now a national competition for the best lock-keeper\'s cottage garden.  Canals to visit  A few of the major canals you may wish to visit include Regent\'s Canal in London, the Kennet and Avon, the Shropshire Union, and the Grand Union Canal, among dozens of others. And here\'s one final tidbit of canal trivia you can use as an ice-breaker at your next party : there are more miles of canals in Birmingham than in Venice! Remember, you heard it here first.

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ('Context: There was a pause of uncertain length ( eyewitness estimates ranged from several seconds to two minutes ) , after which the soldiers fired into the crowd .

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals.

Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008.

The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.

The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris.

Hans Oberhauser is a character from | Question: Which counter-intelligence agency had a name meaning ‘death to spies’ in English?', ['smersh', 'smert shpionam'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1578'), ("Context: Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey , a naval flag designer , and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , designed the 1777 flag while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board 's Middle Department , sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777 . The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 . Furthermore , a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10 , 1779 , documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army 's use in battle . | Question: who made the american flag and what year was it ?", ['1777'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-4622'), ('Context: The United States are the most successful nation in the history of the competition , with 32 victories .

That in itself made it one of my new favorite movies. Combine this with the music and the awesome dancing and it becomes a fantastic movie. I am not going to compare it to the first DD movie. It deserves to be set out on it\'s own. It is definitely worthy. The young actors do an awesome job of portraying the characters in this movie. This is a movie that I would like to own and I don\'t feel that way about a lot of movies. Congratulations to the producers, directors and all of those involved, I will be recommending this one to friends and family.  source  I LOVED Dirty Dancing Havana Night\'s9/10  I loved this movie! It was really good. Yes it was a chick flick and a teen movie, but it was SO good and romantic! Javier (Luna) was SO hot and good. The way his body moved was amazing! The only reason I rated this movie a 9 was because I didn\'t like the way it ended. I thought it could have been done a little differently. But I still went out and bought the DVD!! This may sound a little crazy, but almost every night I watch it! If I could learn to dance the way they do...I would pay to learn how to dance so Cuban! It was a really good, adorable, romantic, and dramatic Movie. It had everything and more that I like to see in a movie. Many people say that they didn\'t like it but, I thought it was awesome.  source  Feel the rhythm of the beat!10/10  This movie is now without a doubt on my top 10 list now! The mix of drama, romance, history, and dance is perfect! The acting, dancing, and music in the movie was great! You want to just stand up and dance (even if you have no idea how to) Havana nights really takes you into the lives of these two people and makes you really care about them. It has an ending that is very true to real life. That things don\'t always go as they should. It had a Romeo and Juliet vibe without being cheesy what so ever. Diego and Romola give a heart warming performance that makes you always want to come back for more. I recommend this movie to anyone that has ever wanted to follow their dreams, but was too afraid to try.

Blood types   are the basis of all Blood classification systems. This proved disastrous.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  Potassium  The name is derived from the english word potash. The chemical symbol K comes from kalium, the Mediaeval Latin for potash, which may have derived from the arabic word qali, meaning alkali.  Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart. Potassium is silvery when first cut but it oxidizes rapidly in air and tarnishes within minutes, so it is generally stored under oil or grease. It is light enough to float into water with which it reacts instantly to release hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame.  The chemistry of potassium is almost etirely that of the potassium ion, K+.  Applications  Most potassium (95 %) goes into fertilizers and the rest goes mainly into making potassium hydroxide (KOH), by the electrolysis of potassium chloride solution, and then converting this to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Potassium carbonate goes into glass manufacture, expecially the glass used to make televisions, while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soaps and detergents. A little potassium chloride goes into pharmaceuticals, medical drips and saline injections.  Other potassium salts are used in baking, photography and tanning leather, and to make iodize salts. In all cases it is the negative anion, not the potassium, which is the key to their use.  Potassium in the environment  Most potassium occurs in the Earth\'s crust as minerals, such as feldspars and clays. Potassium is leached from these by weathering, which explains why there is quite a lot of this element in the sea (0.75 g/liter).  Minerals mined for their potassium are pinkish and sylvite, carnallite and alunite. The main mining area used to be Germany, which had a monopoly of potassium before the first World War. Today most potassium minerals come from Canada, USA and Chile. The world production of potassim ores is about 50 million tonnes, and reserves are vast (more than 10 billion tonnes).  Potassium is a key plant element. Although it is soluble in water, little is lost from undisturbed soils because as it is released from dead plants and animal excrements, it quickly become strongly bound to clay particles, and it is retained ready to be readsorbed by the roots of other plants.  Health effects of potassium  Potassium can be found in vegetables, fruit, potatoes, meat, bread, milk and nuts. It plays an important role in the physical fluid system of humans and it assists nerve functions. Potassium, as the ion K+, concnetrate inside cells, and 95% of the body\'s potassium is so located. When our kidneys are somehow malfunctioning an accumulation of potassium will consist. This can lead to disturbing heartbeats.  Potassium can effect you when breathed in. Inhalation of dust or mists can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, lungs with sneezing, coughing and sore throat. Higher exposures may cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, this can cause death. Skin and eye contact can cause severe burns leading to permanent damage.

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Scientists discover the ability to bring extinct animals back to life via a complex cloning process. To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.

Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes.

The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.

The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 . Furthermore , a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10 , 1779 , documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army 's use in battle . | Question: who made the american flag and what year was it ?", ['1777'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-4622'), ('Context: The United States are the most successful nation in the history of the competition , with 32 victories .

The only reason I rated this movie a 9 was because I didn\'t like the way it ended. I thought it could have been done a little differently. But I still went out and bought the DVD!! This may sound a little crazy, but almost every night I watch it! If I could learn to dance the way they do...I would pay to learn how to dance so Cuban!

It has an ending that is very true to real life. That things don\'t always go as they should. It had a Romeo and Juliet vibe without being cheesy what so ever.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success.

Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  Potassium  The name is derived from the english word potash. The chemical symbol K comes from kalium, the Mediaeval Latin for potash, which may have derived from the arabic word qali, meaning alkali.  Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart. Potassium is silvery when first cut but it oxidizes rapidly in air and tarnishes within minutes, so it is generally stored under oil or grease. It is light enough to float into water with which it reacts instantly to release hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame.  The chemistry of potassium is almost etirely that of the potassium ion, K+.  Applications  Most potassium (95 %) goes into fertilizers and the rest goes mainly into making potassium hydroxide (KOH), by the electrolysis of potassium chloride solution, and then converting this to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Potassium carbonate goes into glass manufacture, expecially the glass used to make televisions, while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soaps and detergents. A little potassium chloride goes into pharmaceuticals, medical drips and saline injections.  Other potassium salts are used in baking, photography and tanning leather, and to make iodize salts. In all cases it is the negative anion, not the potassium, which is the key to their use.  Potassium in the environment  Most potassium occurs in the Earth\'s crust as minerals, such as feldspars and clays. Potassium is leached from these by weathering, which explains why there is quite a lot of this element in the sea (0.75 g/liter).  Minerals mined for their potassium are pinkish and sylvite, carnallite and alunite. The main mining area used to be Germany, which had a monopoly of potassium before the first World War. Today most potassium minerals come from Canada, USA and Chile. The world production of potassim ores is about 50 million tonnes, and reserves are vast (more than 10 billion tonnes).  Potassium is a key plant element. Although it is soluble in water, little is lost from undisturbed soils because as it is released from dead plants and animal excrements, it quickly become strongly bound to clay particles, and it is retained ready to be readsorbed by the roots of other plants.  Health effects of potassium  Potassium can be found in vegetables, fruit, potatoes, meat, bread, milk and nuts. It plays an important role in the physical fluid system of humans and it assists nerve functions. Potassium, as the ion K+, concnetrate inside cells, and 95% of the body\'s potassium is so located. When our kidneys are somehow malfunctioning an accumulation of potassium will consist. This can lead to disturbing heartbeats.  Potassium can effect you when breathed in. Inhalation of dust or mists can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, lungs with sneezing, coughing and sore throat. Higher exposures may cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, this can cause death. Skin and eye contact can cause severe burns leading to permanent damage.

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

Phlebotomists Duties: What Exactly does a Phlebotomist do?  written by: Victoria Trix•edited by: DaniellaNicole•updated: 1/31/2009  You may have heard the term Phlebotomist but what exactly are the duties of a Phlebotomist and what does a Phlebotomist do?  slide 1 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties  Phlebotomists duties and responsibilities center around the obtaining and proper handling of human blood. The basic services of the phlebotomist include taking blood samples from patients and correctly cataloging them for lab analysis, but the importance of the phlebotomist is far more critical than this simple description implies.  slide 2 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Critical Responsibilities  Since phlebotomists have an extremely high potential to be exposed to blood borne diseases and contaminants, the level of caution and expertise they use in the execution of their duties is critical to their own safety as well as all others that may be exposed to the fluid samples they draw. Under the direction of a physician or other licensed health care professional, phlebotomists duties includes collecting samples of blood and other fluids from patients. Prior to collection, it is the phlebotomist’s responsibility to assure that all collection instruments and environments are sterile and of first use.  After sample collection, the phlebotomists duties will include correctly labeling the collection container with pertinent patient information for identification, and subsequently must complete and file companion paperwork to trace the route of the sample from collection through lab work through final analysis and diagnosis and finally to proper disposal of the fluids. Any error in the job of a phlebotomist can have consequences that range from misdiagnosis to fatal contamination. In addition, phlebotomists on a hospital staff will also be required to train other phlebotomists in sample collection and follow up.  slide 3 of 5  Additional Phlebotomists Duties  Some phlebotomists duties, for example those that conduct home care visits, will also include being responsible for transportation of fluid samples between the sample site and the laboratory. In some cases the phlebotomists duties will also include being responsible for performing certain functions to process blood samples for further analysis by attending medical professionals.  Phlebotomists that work in a laboratory environment have the added task of ensuring that samples are correctly analyzed by enforcing quality control and safety measures to prevent the contamination of samples during analysis.  slide 4 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Education and Career  Phlebotomy training is obtained by passing a one year vocational program which is offered through technical schools or community colleges. Many community colleges also offer associate’s degree programs in phlebotomy. In addition to becoming certified as a phlebotomist, some states will require licensing or registration.  A certified phlebotomist can expect an annual salary ranging from $20,000 to $48,000, with an increase in demand for services expected through 2012. As the demand increases, more facilities will require pre-certification of phlebotomists before they are hired, to reduce the impact of liability.  Phlebotomists' duties and services are usually scheduled, rather than performed under emergency situations. Given this fact, phlebotomists usually have the benefit of shift hours that match regular office hours, which is a luxury not typically found in the medical profession.  slide 5 of 5 | Question: What does a phlebotomist usually deal with?", ['taking blood'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3552'), ("Context: Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city ...Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city | Daily Mail Online  Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city  comments  Prague is one of Europe's architectural gems, with more knockout picture-postcard views than some entire countries. Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.  RELATED ARTICLES  Share  3...Fighting for freedom  After the euphoria of spring 1968, and Czechoslovakia’s short-lived break for freedom from the Soviet Union, came deep gloom that summer when Russian tanks rolled in to consign this proud nation to 20 more years of oppression.  The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures. Star exhibits include two views of the River Thames by Canaletto and Haymaking by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  Another of the city’s new attractions is totally different.

The executive power of both the vice president and the president is granted under Article Two, Section One of the Constitution. The vice president is indirectly elected, together with the president, to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.  The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, and would normally ascend to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president.   The Office of the Vice President of the United States assists and organizes the vice president\'s official functions.  The vice president is also president of the United States Senate  and in that capacity only votes when it is necessary to break a tie. While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.   Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.  While the vice president\'s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments.  Origin  The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state\'s combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state\'s favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector\'s state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector\'s second vote would go to a statesman of national character.  Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son\'s chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot.  Roles of the vice president  The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression "only a heartbeat away from the presidency," and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate.  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.    President of the United States Senate  As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney\'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Semenya won gold in the women\'s 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final. Semenya also won silver medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics, both in the 800 metres.  Following her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. She was withdrawn from international competition until 6 July 2010 when the IAAF cleared her to return to competition.  In 2010, the British magazine New Statesman included Semenya in a list of "50 People That Matter 2010".   Early life and education  Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in South Africa near Polokwane (back then called Pietersburg), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, "deep in South Africa\'s northern Limpopo province." She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a tomboy as a child.   Semenya attended Nthema Secondary School and now attends the University of Pretoria as a sports science student.   She began running as training for soccer.   Career  2008  In July Semenya participated in the 2008 World Junior Championships, and won the gold in the 800 m at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a time of 2:04.23.   2009  In the African Junior Championships Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.    With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone. The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date. It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by Zelda Pretorius at 1:58.85, and Zola Budd at 2:00.90, respectively.   The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it was "obliged to investigate" after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m\xa0– "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use."  The IAAF also asked Semenya to undergo a gender test after the win. News that the IAAF requested the test broke three hours before the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions."   In August Semenya won gold in the 800 metres at the World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final, again setting the fastest time of the year.   Gender test  Following her victory at the world championships, questions were raised about her gender.    The IAAF\'s handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticized the organization for its response to the incident.  Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as racist, as well as an affront to Semenya\'s privacy and human rights.   The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted."  The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a "rare medical condition" giving her an unfair competitive advantage. The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.  In an interview with South African magazine YOU Semenya stated, "God made me the way I am and I accept myself." She also took part in a makeover with the magazine.   On 7 September 2009, Wilfred Daniels, Semenya\'s coach with Athletics South Africa (ASA), resigned because he felt that ASA "did not advise Ms. Semenya properly". He apologised for personally having failed to protect her.

Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised.

The 12 animals that appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar include a rat, buffalo (ox), tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. It’s an unusual combination of animals for sure, and their appearance on the Chinese Zodiac is the topic of countless legends and is deeply embedded in Chinese mythology.  An unlikely gathering  The most well-known of the Chinese zodiac legends states that Buddha invited the animals to participate in a race. The prize was a coveted position on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. The first 12 animals to cross the river would appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar in the order in which they completed the race.  The first animal to make it across the finish line according to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology was the rat. It seems unlikely that such a small animal could win such a strenuous race, especially when one considers all the contenders.  Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology explains that the rat used his brain rather than his brawn. It hitched a ride on what it perceived was the mightiest swimmer. Just before the buffalo reached the shore, the rat jumped off the buffalo’s back and crossed the finish line before the buffalo, putting the rat in first place.  The buffalo came in second and as promised in the legends and mythology, was the second animal listed on the Chinese Zodiac. The tiger, also being strong, came in third, followed by the rabbit that jumped his way across and was helped during the last stretch by the dragon. A snake hid in the hoof of the horse which is how it managed to make it across the river. At the last minute the snake jumped out and scared the horse into seventh place.  The sheep, monkey and rooster helped one another across and earned their spots on the calendar as well. The dog made it too, but decided a bath was more important than the position which is why it came in eleventh. Finally, the pig appeared and is listed last. According to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology, the pig feasted and rested half-way through the race, but made it across guaranteeing its position.  A small gathering  The history of the Chinese Zodiac weaves another intriguing tale. This one tells of an invitation to a grand feast. All the animals were invited to join Buddha at either a birthday celebration, a New Year celebration, or a celebration for his departure from this world. Only 12 animals showed up at the festivities and that’s how they ended up being featured on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. Another of the legends of the Chinese Zodiac states that instead of Buddha, it was the Jade Emperor who invited the animals.  Regardless of the specific version of Chinese Zodiac history to which you subscribe, the Chinese Zodiac has amazed and entertained people around the world for thousands of years.

Phlebotomists Duties: What Exactly does a Phlebotomist do?  written by: Victoria Trix•edited by: DaniellaNicole•updated: 1/31/2009  You may have heard the term Phlebotomist but what exactly are the duties of a Phlebotomist and what does a Phlebotomist do?  slide 1 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties  Phlebotomists duties and responsibilities center around the obtaining and proper handling of human blood. The basic services of the phlebotomist include taking blood samples from patients and correctly cataloging them for lab analysis, but the importance of the phlebotomist is far more critical than this simple description implies.  slide 2 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Critical Responsibilities  Since phlebotomists have an extremely high potential to be exposed to blood borne diseases and contaminants, the level of caution and expertise they use in the execution of their duties is critical to their own safety as well as all others that may be exposed to the fluid samples they draw. Under the direction of a physician or other licensed health care professional, phlebotomists duties includes collecting samples of blood and other fluids from patients. Prior to collection, it is the phlebotomist’s responsibility to assure that all collection instruments and environments are sterile and of first use.  After sample collection, the phlebotomists duties will include correctly labeling the collection container with pertinent patient information for identification, and subsequently must complete and file companion paperwork to trace the route of the sample from collection through lab work through final analysis and diagnosis and finally to proper disposal of the fluids. Any error in the job of a phlebotomist can have consequences that range from misdiagnosis to fatal contamination. In addition, phlebotomists on a hospital staff will also be required to train other phlebotomists in sample collection and follow up.  slide 3 of 5  Additional Phlebotomists Duties  Some phlebotomists duties, for example those that conduct home care visits, will also include being responsible for transportation of fluid samples between the sample site and the laboratory. In some cases the phlebotomists duties will also include being responsible for performing certain functions to process blood samples for further analysis by attending medical professionals.  Phlebotomists that work in a laboratory environment have the added task of ensuring that samples are correctly analyzed by enforcing quality control and safety measures to prevent the contamination of samples during analysis.  slide 4 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Education and Career  Phlebotomy training is obtained by passing a one year vocational program which is offered through technical schools or community colleges. Many community colleges also offer associate’s degree programs in phlebotomy. In addition to becoming certified as a phlebotomist, some states will require licensing or registration.  A certified phlebotomist can expect an annual salary ranging from $20,000 to $48,000, with an increase in demand for services expected through 2012. As the demand increases, more facilities will require pre-certification of phlebotomists before they are hired, to reduce the impact of liability.  Phlebotomists' duties and services are usually scheduled, rather than performed under emergency situations. Given this fact, phlebotomists usually have the benefit of shift hours that match regular office hours, which is a luxury not typically found in the medical profession.  slide 5 of 5 | Question: What does a phlebotomist usually deal with?", ['taking blood'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3552'), ("Context: Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city ...Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city | Daily Mail Online  Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city  comments  Prague is one of Europe's architectural gems, with more knockout picture-postcard views than some entire countries.

New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties.

With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds.

Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.  While the vice president\'s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments.  Origin  The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state\'s combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state\'s favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector\'s state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector\'s second vote would go to a statesman of national character.  Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son\'s chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot.  Roles of the vice president  The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression "only a heartbeat away from the presidency," and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate.  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.    President of the United States Senate  As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney\'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.  Regular duties  As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Semenya won gold in the women\'s 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final. Semenya also won silver medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics, both in the 800 metres.  Following her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. She was withdrawn from international competition until 6 July 2010 when the IAAF cleared her to return to competition.  In 2010, the British magazine New Statesman included Semenya in a list of "50 People That Matter 2010".   Early life and education  Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in South Africa near Polokwane (back then called Pietersburg), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, "deep in South Africa\'s northern Limpopo province." She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a tomboy as a child.   Semenya attended Nthema Secondary School and now attends the University of Pretoria as a sports science student.   She began running as training for soccer.   Career  2008  In July Semenya participated in the 2008 World Junior Championships, and won the gold in the 800 m at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a time of 2:04.23.   2009  In the African Junior Championships Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.    With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone. The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date. It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by Zelda Pretorius at 1:58.85, and Zola Budd at 2:00.90, respectively.   The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it was "obliged to investigate" after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m\xa0– "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use."  The IAAF also asked Semenya to undergo a gender test after the win. News that the IAAF requested the test broke three hours before the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions."   In August Semenya won gold in the 800 metres at the World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final, again setting the fastest time of the year.   Gender test  Following her victory at the world championships, questions were raised about her gender.    The IAAF\'s handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticized the organization for its response to the incident.  Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as racist, as well as an affront to Semenya\'s privacy and human rights.   The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted."  The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a "rare medical condition" giving her an unfair competitive advantage. The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.  In an interview with South African magazine YOU Semenya stated, "God made me the way I am and I accept myself." She also took part in a makeover with the magazine.   On 7 September 2009, Wilfred Daniels, Semenya\'s coach with Athletics South Africa (ASA), resigned because he felt that ASA "did not advise Ms. Semenya properly". He apologised for personally having failed to protect her.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

The 12 animals that appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar include a rat, buffalo (ox), tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. It’s an unusual combination of animals for sure, and their appearance on the Chinese Zodiac is the topic of countless legends and is deeply embedded in Chinese mythology.  An unlikely gathering  The most well-known of the Chinese zodiac legends states that Buddha invited the animals to participate in a race. The prize was a coveted position on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. The first 12 animals to cross the river would appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar in the order in which they completed the race.  The first animal to make it across the finish line according to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology was the rat. It seems unlikely that such a small animal could win such a strenuous race, especially when one considers all the contenders.  Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology explains that the rat used his brain rather than his brawn. It hitched a ride on what it perceived was the mightiest swimmer. Just before the buffalo reached the shore, the rat jumped off the buffalo’s back and crossed the finish line before the buffalo, putting the rat in first place.  The buffalo came in second and as promised in the legends and mythology, was the second animal listed on the Chinese Zodiac. The tiger, also being strong, came in third, followed by the rabbit that jumped his way across and was helped during the last stretch by the dragon. A snake hid in the hoof of the horse which is how it managed to make it across the river. At the last minute the snake jumped out and scared the horse into seventh place.  The sheep, monkey and rooster helped one another across and earned their spots on the calendar as well. The dog made it too, but decided a bath was more important than the position which is why it came in eleventh. Finally, the pig appeared and is listed last. According to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology, the pig feasted and rested half-way through the race, but made it across guaranteeing its position.  A small gathering  The history of the Chinese Zodiac weaves another intriguing tale. This one tells of an invitation to a grand feast. All the animals were invited to join Buddha at either a birthday celebration, a New Year celebration, or a celebration for his departure from this world. Only 12 animals showed up at the festivities and that’s how they ended up being featured on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. Another of the legends of the Chinese Zodiac states that instead of Buddha, it was the Jade Emperor who invited the animals.  Regardless of the specific version of Chinese Zodiac history to which you subscribe, the Chinese Zodiac has amazed and entertained people around the world for thousands of years.

Olivia Nuzzi  09.27.14 12:55 AM ET  Had John McCain been elected president in 2008, Sarah Palin still may not have ever set foot in the White House…because she wouldn’t have been able to find it.  On Friday afternoon, the failed reality-television star and one-time VP nominee materialized in Washington, clad in a leather blazer, to deliver a speech to the crowd at the Values Voter Summit—an annual social-conservative confab held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, a sprawling, gilded maze of a place that is rumored to be haunted by a dead maid.  Maybe she was the one screwing with Palin’s notes, because about halfway through her remarks, Palin said this: “Don’t retreat: You reload with truth, which I know is an endangered species at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue. Anyway, truth.”  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.  One assumes Palin was attempting to say truth is an endangered species at the White House, which is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue is roughly a plaza in front of the Willard Hotel.  Palin is not the first politician to make this mistake. On Aug. 1, 2008, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, Republican from Texas, wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush, which he addressed to:  “The President  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, D.C. 20500”  I would like to imagine Conaway has spent the last six years wondering why he never received a response.  Out in the hallway of the Omni Shoreham, I talked to conservative women who felt that Palin’s mistake was not a big deal: “She speaks from the heart,” Marlea Knighton of Arizona, said. “The news never misprints?” Linda, an older lady from Virginia, said that anyone criticizing Palin for not knowing where the White House is located is just doing it “because they’re scared of what she says,” because women “who love the Lord” are intimidating to non-believers, like those populating the mainstream media.  Mark Roeske, who operates campaign buses, offered a different take: Conservative women like Palin intimidate feminist women because “they’re women who are not just a vagina,” and so they feel compelled to attack her whenever possible and make her seem stupid.  Gaffe aside, the rest of Palin’s speech was an unremarkable, nonsensical collection of Palinisms haphazardly strung together and delivered in her signature bright-yet-bitter-sounding sing-song style—like a homicidal kindergarten teacher.  “You’re the Americans that the media loves to hate,” she crooned, menacingly. And then, “All you mama grizzlies out there, rear up and charge against the lawless, imperial president and his failed liberal agenda and the lapdogs in the media.” And then, “So, I’m out in the shop with Todd, and he’s winterizing his snow plane.”  Let’s hope Todd has a better sense of direction.

Life, Paintings, Rubenshuis Museum  On other pages : Antwerp Central Railway Station | Saint Charles Borromeo's Church | Saint James' Church | About Peter Paul Rubens and the Rubenshuis Museum  Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp : Life, Where are his Paintings?  Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time.  During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north.  Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp.  Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced.  Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints.  Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life.  Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles.  Last time I checked, a painting of Rubens, 'Massacre of the Innocents', still holds the record as the most expensive painting by an old master, sold at auction (Sotheby's, 49.5 million Pounds).

The Philippines , the Philippine Sea , and the Pacific Ocean are to the north; the Arafura Sea and the island of Timor are to the south.  The islands comprise the two Indonesian propinsi (or provinsi; provinces) of North Maluku (Maluku Utara) and Maluku . The principal islands of North Maluku are Halmahera , Obi , Morotai , Bacan , and the main islands of the Sula archipelago (Taliabu, Mangole, and Sulabesi); significant smaller islands include Ternate and Tidore . To the south, the province of Maluku encompasses , most notably, the islands of Ceram (Seram), Buru , and Ambon , as well as the Banda , Wetar , Babar , Tanimbar , Kai , and Aru archipelagos. Area 30,462 square miles (78,897 square km). Pop. (2000) 1,981,401; (2010) 2,571,593.  Geography  Most of the Moluccas are mountainous, although the Tanimbar and Aru island groups are low and swampy. Earthquakes are frequent, and several islands, especially Ternate and Banda , have active volcanoes . The climate of the Moluccas is tropical, with rainfall varying from 80 to 150 inches (2,000 to 3,800 mm) annually in various locations. Some of the land has been cleared for cultivation, but other areas remain covered with evergreen rainforest . There are patches of open savanna , and the coasts are often fringed with mangrove swamps. The Moluccas are a transition zone between Asian and Australian fauna and flora, and the animal life and vegetation of the islands include many species that are unique to the region.  The population of the islands is diverse , with the Ambonese, Butonese (people from the island of Buton in Southeast Sulawesi ), and Kai peoples together constituting roughly one-third of the islands’ residents in relatively equal numbers. Most of the remainder of the population consists of scores of smaller groups, many living in sparsely settled inland regions, as well a notable minority of Chinese descent, concentrated primarily in larger towns and urban areas. The principal cities of the Moluccas include Ambon (on the island of Ambon ), in the central region, and Ternate (on the island of Ternate ), in the north.  Similar Topics  Andaman Islands  Dozens of languages are spoken in the Moluccas, although Malay (of which the national language, Indonesian, is a dialect) has for centuries been used as a lingua franca ; in many areas, Malay has eclipsed local languages. Christianity (mostly Protestant ) and Islam are the dominant religions. A small but notable minority practices Hinduism or Buddhism , and some communities in the interior regions follow local religions. Except in northern Halmahera , Morotai , Ternate, Tidore, and several other areas of the northern Moluccas—where West Papuan languages are spoken—all languages spoken in the islands belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.  Most residents are engaged in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Rice, coconuts, and cocoa are widely grown, and fish, forest products, copra , and spices are among the most significant exports. Petroleum is mined in limited quantities, primarily on Ceram.  History  The cloves of the northern Moluccas and the nutmeg of the central islands were traded in Asia long before Europeans heard of the so-called Spice Islands . The Portuguese established themselves on the islands in 1512, beginning many decades of conflict that caused great losses of life. The first major confrontation was between the Portuguese and the reigning sultans of Ternate and Tidore ; later, the Spanish, English, and Dutch wrestled for control of the islands. Eventually, the Dutch emerged victorious, and they earned large profits from their enterprise in the Moluccas. By the end of the 18th century, however, the spice trade had greatly diminished, and the islands had become an economic backwater.

Olivia Nuzzi  09.27.14 12:55 AM ET  Had John McCain been elected president in 2008, Sarah Palin still may not have ever set foot in the White House…because she wouldn’t have been able to find it.  On Friday afternoon, the failed reality-television star and one-time VP nominee materialized in Washington, clad in a leather blazer, to deliver a speech to the crowd at the Values Voter Summit—an annual social-conservative confab held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, a sprawling, gilded maze of a place that is rumored to be haunted by a dead maid.  Maybe she was the one screwing with Palin’s notes, because about halfway through her remarks, Palin said this: “Don’t retreat: You reload with truth, which I know is an endangered species at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue. Anyway, truth.”  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.  One assumes Palin was attempting to say truth is an endangered species at the White House, which is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue is roughly a plaza in front of the Willard Hotel.  Palin is not the first politician to make this mistake. On Aug. 1, 2008, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, Republican from Texas, wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush, which he addressed to:  “The President  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, D.C. 20500”  I would like to imagine Conaway has spent the last six years wondering why he never received a response.  Out in the hallway of the Omni Shoreham, I talked to conservative women who felt that Palin’s mistake was not a big deal: “She speaks from the heart,” Marlea Knighton of Arizona, said. “The news never misprints?” Linda, an older lady from Virginia, said that anyone criticizing Palin for not knowing where the White House is located is just doing it “because they’re scared of what she says,” because women “who love the Lord” are intimidating to non-believers, like those populating the mainstream media.  Mark Roeske, who operates campaign buses, offered a different take: Conservative women like Palin intimidate feminist women because “they’re women who are not just a vagina,” and so they feel compelled to attack her whenever possible and make her seem stupid.  Gaffe aside, the rest of Palin’s speech was an unremarkable, nonsensical collection of Palinisms haphazardly strung together and delivered in her signature bright-yet-bitter-sounding sing-song style—like a homicidal kindergarten teacher.  “You’re the Americans that the media loves to hate,” she crooned, menacingly. And then, “All you mama grizzlies out there, rear up and charge against the lawless, imperial president and his failed liberal agenda and the lapdogs in the media.” And then, “So, I’m out in the shop with Todd, and he’s winterizing his snow plane.”  Let’s hope Todd has a better sense of direction.

Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time.  During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north.  Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp.  Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced.  Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints.  Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life.  Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles.

The Philippines , the Philippine Sea , and the Pacific Ocean are to the north; the Arafura Sea and the island of Timor are to the south.  The islands comprise the two Indonesian propinsi (or provinsi; provinces) of North Maluku (Maluku Utara) and Maluku . The principal islands of North Maluku are Halmahera , Obi , Morotai , Bacan , and the main islands of the Sula archipelago (Taliabu, Mangole, and Sulabesi); significant smaller islands include Ternate and Tidore . To the south, the province of Maluku encompasses , most notably, the islands of Ceram (Seram), Buru , and Ambon , as well as the Banda , Wetar , Babar , Tanimbar , Kai , and Aru archipelagos. Area 30,462 square miles (78,897 square km). Pop. (2000) 1,981,401; (2010) 2,571,593.  Geography  Most of the Moluccas are mountainous, although the Tanimbar and Aru island groups are low and swampy. Earthquakes are frequent, and several islands, especially Ternate and Banda , have active volcanoes . The climate of the Moluccas is tropical, with rainfall varying from 80 to 150 inches (2,000 to 3,800 mm) annually in various locations. Some of the land has been cleared for cultivation, but other areas remain covered with evergreen rainforest . There are patches of open savanna , and the coasts are often fringed with mangrove swamps. The Moluccas are a transition zone between Asian and Australian fauna and flora, and the animal life and vegetation of the islands include many species that are unique to the region.  The population of the islands is diverse , with the Ambonese, Butonese (people from the island of Buton in Southeast Sulawesi ), and Kai peoples together constituting roughly one-third of the islands’ residents in relatively equal numbers. Most of the remainder of the population consists of scores of smaller groups, many living in sparsely settled inland regions, as well a notable minority of Chinese descent, concentrated primarily in larger towns and urban areas. The principal cities of the Moluccas include Ambon (on the island of Ambon ), in the central region, and Ternate (on the island of Ternate ), in the north.  Similar Topics  Andaman Islands  Dozens of languages are spoken in the Moluccas, although Malay (of which the national language, Indonesian, is a dialect) has for centuries been used as a lingua franca ; in many areas, Malay has eclipsed local languages. Christianity (mostly Protestant ) and Islam are the dominant religions. A small but notable minority practices Hinduism or Buddhism , and some communities in the interior regions follow local religions. Except in northern Halmahera , Morotai , Ternate, Tidore, and several other areas of the northern Moluccas—where West Papuan languages are spoken—all languages spoken in the islands belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.  Most residents are engaged in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Rice, coconuts, and cocoa are widely grown, and fish, forest products, copra , and spices are among the most significant exports. Petroleum is mined in limited quantities, primarily on Ceram.  History  The cloves of the northern Moluccas and the nutmeg of the central islands were traded in Asia long before Europeans heard of the so-called Spice Islands . The Portuguese established themselves on the islands in 1512, beginning many decades of conflict that caused great losses of life. The first major confrontation was between the Portuguese and the reigning sultans of Ternate and Tidore ; later, the Spanish, English, and Dutch wrestled for control of the islands. Eventually, the Dutch emerged victorious, and they earned large profits from their enterprise in the Moluccas. By the end of the 18th century, however, the spice trade had greatly diminished, and the islands had become an economic backwater.

The grand event takes place at the famous “Theresienwiese” field where large tents are constructed over a three month period that begins in the summer.\xa0  Oktoberfest dates back to the marriage celebration of Prince Ludwig to Princess Therese in 1810. On this special day, the people of Munich were invited to participate in the celebration which was held for five days on the fields in front of the city gates. What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair. From that day on, the festivities have continued more or less on an annual basis (outside of the 24 times it was canceled due to war and cholera).\xa0  "What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair."\xa0  Over the decades, the festival has evolved into an elaborate affair spanning from late September to early October. Oktoberfest 2016 will commence on September 17th and run through October 3rd, totalling 17 days of beer-drinking Bavarian shenanigans.\xa0  \xa0  Oktoberfest Must Sees and Dos  All About the Tents  Entry into Oktoberfest is free! You may enter both the festival and tents free of charge (with the exception of the “Historical Wies’n” which requires a small fee). Oktoberfest showcases 14 spectacular tents with 1,000 - 8,500 seats which are owned by various restaurants, breweries and other establishments. There are also a number of smaller tents and beer gardens in the vicinity.\xa0  All tents are unique and have their own charm, so if you have the time, we recommend trying to check them all out! The tents serve Bavarian beers, traditional eats, and are booming with live music throughout the day and night. Music performances are comprised of a mix of both traditional Bavarian music and contemporary bands playing later in the evenings.\xa0  While it’s possible to visit all of the tents, the issue is whether or not you can get a seat, especially on weekends and during bad weather. Although tents do offer reservations, they can be next to impossible to get. Reservations are typically given to large German companies and groups, and the tents always serve their existing customers from previous years first.\xa0  The remaining requests are put on a daunting waiting list; nonetheless, it’s still worth a shot! If you’re travelling in a small group of 2 or 3, you can patiently wait until someone leaves, and then quickly grab their table. And if it’s a pretty crowded day, you’ll be better off remaining at the table instead of venturing off to another tent where you’ll likely meet another long wait. Note that tents will be closed if they become too full, and will be re-opened later when more space is available. For a map and details on the fourteen tents, check out Oktoberfest’s Tent Guide with photos and descriptions of each tent.  Beer & Other Beverages  The Oktoberfest beer is by far the event’s most popular attraction. Large one liter beers are served in traditional German “Maß” mugs. The Club of Munich Brewers maintains strict regulations on exactly which brands of beer can be served at the festival. There are currently only 6 breweries whose beer meets the criteria. In doing so they must adhere to the Bavarian Purity Laws established for beer brewing in 1487 and the beers must be brewed within Munich city limits. Check out more details on the breweries here .\xa0  At the 2015 festival alone, a whopping 7.7 million liters of beer were consumed. A typical beer costs between €9.70 and €10.10 and is sold in the tents between the hours of 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. during the weekdays and between 9 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

And there is more…  Iceland is one of the Nordic countries and part of Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden).  Reykjavík is the capital city of the Republic of Iceland.  Hvannadalshnukur (2,119m) is the highest point in Iceland.  Vatnajokull glacier in Southeast Iceland is Europe’s largest glacier.  Hekla is Iceland\'s most active volcano; Hekla is also a common female name in Iceland.  In 1963 a new volcano appeared in the Atlantic close to Iceland. It grew to become an island now called Surtsey.  The English word "geyser" comes from Iceland\'s Great Geysir in Haukadalur.  The phenomenon of the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) can be seen during mid-winter (November-December) when the weather is clear.  The "Althingi", the Icelandic parliament, dates back to the early tenth century.  The last name of Icelanders is derived from their father\'s first name.  In the telephone book everyone is listed by their first name.  In the last quarter of the nineteenth century twenty percent of Iceland\'s population emigrated to Canada and the USA.  In the 1960s and 70s there was a dispute between Iceland and the UK over fishing grounds, known as the "Cod Wars".  The population of Iceland reached 300,000 in the year 2006.

Supernatural Iceland  Elves, trolls and ghosts  Surveys show that despite their obsession with modern technology, as many as 80% of Icelanders believe in the existence of elves. Even today, roads have been rerouted and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.  All around the country, strange lava formations were once explained in folktales as trolls who were turned to stone when caught outdoors in daylight. But only children in Iceland believe in trolls today, and the once widespread belief in ghosts is in decline, some say because electricity has taken the fright out of the long winter nights.  A different kind of fauna  Contrary to what many people think, there are no polar bears in Iceland. Admittedly, every ten years or so a polar bear may arrive as an accidental tourist on an ice flow from Greenland, However, they aren\'t invited to stay. The Arctic fox is the only native mammal. Reindeer live in the wild in east Iceland, but were only imported in the 18th century. Mink have also adapted to the wild, the descendants of animals which escaped from fur farms in the 1930s. A number of pedigree animal stocks are only found in Iceland. Many of these rare breeds have disappeared elsewhere and are the original decedents brought over by the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, cow, sheep and sheepdog. Marine mammals are also found in abundance along the coasts, especially minke whale, humpback whale, fin whale and several species of seals.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Time of Publication: 2:08 pm.  2:08 pm  The 10 Most Walkable Cities in America  Mitchell Funk/Getty  Cities that make life easier for pedestrians are, to many, better places to live. Studies have shown that walkable urban areas are healthier, wealthier and safer (perhaps in part because wealthy people can afford to live in nicer places)—and anyway, who doesn’t want to go outside every once in a while?  If getting around without a car appeals, you should head to New York City or San Francisco (if you can afford either). That’s according to a new ranking of the most walkable large US cities by Redfin, a real estate analysis website and brokerage.  The site uses something it calls Walk Score, an algorithm to measure how convenient it is to do daily errands without wheels, on a 100-point scale. It doesn’t take into account public transit systems (there’s a different score for that), but looks at things like the walking distance to schools, restaurants, and grocery stores, from any given point.  “It’s a population-rated average, sampled at every block,” explains Matt Lerner, VP of products at Redfin. “We’re basically sampling the walk score for every block in the city, weighted by the number of people who live there.” Cities are scored by where the population is, and aren’t penalized for non-walkable areas like shipping ports, industrial districts, and airports.  Most of the cities in the Redfin top 10 are unsurprising. NYC, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington D.C. all got big before the automobile age, so they were made for moving on foot. But the top scores for Miami, Oakland, and Seattle point to the fact that history isn’t all that matters. Cities can change to cater to pedestrians instead of, or at least in addition to, cars.  Lots of cities have become more pedestrian-friendly since Redfin’s last rankings, in 2011. Four years ago, New York City and San Francisco had basically the same score (about 85). Now, the Big Apple’s several points up, thanks to pro-walking efforts like booting cars out of Times Square, Lerner says.  Detroit didn’t crack the top ten, but its score went up 2.2 points, to 52.2, in part thanks to the downtown arrival of big companies like Quicken Loans, bringing restaurants, shops, and businesses with them. New Orleans’ score rose nearly a point, as it develops more affordable housing and revitalizes commercial districts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Edith Cresson was born January 27, 1934, in a fashionable Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Her father was a senior civil servant. Raised by a British nanny, she became fluent in the English language. Cresson attended the School of Advanced Commercial Studies, earning a degree in business and later a doctorate in demography.  A successful businesswoman, she added a second career in politics when she met François Mitterrand in 1965. For the next 26 years the future president helped Cresson advance through the ranks of what is now the French Socialist Party, calling her "my little soldier."  After Mitterrand became president in 1981, Cresson served first as minister of agriculture (1981-1983), then as minister of external trade and tourism (1983-1984), as minister of industrial restructuring and external trade (1984-1986), and finally minister of foreign affairs (1988-1990). She resigned from the government on October 3, 1990, to work as a consultant on international development. Meanwhile she was three times elected a deputy to the National Assembly from the Vienne province (1981, 1986, 1988).  Then in May 1991, President Mitterrand asked Cresson to form a new government. Some experts believe Mitterand had grown dissatisfied with the failures of the government of Michel Rocard to gain majorities in the National Assembly.   Others believe the French president foresaw major international trade issues looming as the trans-European Union came into existence, and sought Cresson\'s expertise in trade affairs.  As prime minister, the combative Cresson planned to strengthen France\'s industrial power and to "protect" French and European trade from the inroads of Japanese and American products. In assembling her new cabinet of 29 members she chose a number of holdovers from the government of her predecessor. One, Pierre Brgovoy, was named to head a new superministry combining economic, trade, industrial, and technology affairs. His appointment served to restore trust in the French leadership in financial markets. She also appointed five women, three to posts in labor, development, and youth and sports.  When her appointment to prime minister drew misogynist remarks from some politicians of France\'s center and right parties, Cresson said, "Men are not in any sense irreplaceable except in one\'s private life." Nevertheless, more fair-minded criticism about her ability to command majorities in the National Assembly persisted.  The Cresson government moved aggressively to free what had become a stagnant economy, and on contentious domestic issues, frequently centered around immigrants. Quoted making strident and antagonistic comments about the Japanese "strategy of conquest," Cresson was greatly concerned over what she was convinced to be Japan\'s major threat to European trade and commonwealth. Diplomatically, her outspokenness was creating unease in international circles. Within four months of becoming president, the Cresson government had fallen precipitously in popularity. Subtle and not-so-subtle attacks on her gender continued, including a popular daytime television show featuring two puppet characters, one a sexy and servile female broadly seen as a Cresson parody. In April 1992, Cresson resigned. Since then she has served as Commissioner for Science, Research and Development to the European Commission.  Cresson\'s husband, Jacques, a retired executive of Peugeot, the French automobile and appliance company, remained supportive of his wife, and their relationship has been likened to that of Margaret Thatcher and her husband. Cresson has been compared to the British prime minister for her bluntness, energy, and stubbornness. They have two daughters.  Further Reading on Edith Cresson  The appointment and career of Cresson was covered in the Washington Post (May 16 and May 18, 1991). See also "An Iron Lady Across the Channel?"

The grand event takes place at the famous “Theresienwiese” field where large tents are constructed over a three month period that begins in the summer.\xa0  Oktoberfest dates back to the marriage celebration of Prince Ludwig to Princess Therese in 1810. On this special day, the people of Munich were invited to participate in the celebration which was held for five days on the fields in front of the city gates. What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair. From that day on, the festivities have continued more or less on an annual basis (outside of the 24 times it was canceled due to war and cholera).\xa0  "What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair."\xa0  Over the decades, the festival has evolved into an elaborate affair spanning from late September to early October. Oktoberfest 2016 will commence on September 17th and run through October 3rd, totalling 17 days of beer-drinking Bavarian shenanigans.\xa0  \xa0  Oktoberfest Must Sees and Dos  All About the Tents  Entry into Oktoberfest is free! You may enter both the festival and tents free of charge (with the exception of the “Historical Wies’n” which requires a small fee). Oktoberfest showcases 14 spectacular tents with 1,000 - 8,500 seats which are owned by various restaurants, breweries and other establishments. There are also a number of smaller tents and beer gardens in the vicinity.\xa0  All tents are unique and have their own charm, so if you have the time, we recommend trying to check them all out! The tents serve Bavarian beers, traditional eats, and are booming with live music throughout the day and night. Music performances are comprised of a mix of both traditional Bavarian music and contemporary bands playing later in the evenings.\xa0  While it’s possible to visit all of the tents, the issue is whether or not you can get a seat, especially on weekends and during bad weather. Although tents do offer reservations, they can be next to impossible to get. Reservations are typically given to large German companies and groups, and the tents always serve their existing customers from previous years first.\xa0  The remaining requests are put on a daunting waiting list; nonetheless, it’s still worth a shot! If you’re travelling in a small group of 2 or 3, you can patiently wait until someone leaves, and then quickly grab their table. And if it’s a pretty crowded day, you’ll be better off remaining at the table instead of venturing off to another tent where you’ll likely meet another long wait. Note that tents will be closed if they become too full, and will be re-opened later when more space is available. For a map and details on the fourteen tents, check out Oktoberfest’s Tent Guide with photos and descriptions of each tent.  Beer & Other Beverages  The Oktoberfest beer is by far the event’s most popular attraction. Large one liter beers are served in traditional German “Maß” mugs. The Club of Munich Brewers maintains strict regulations on exactly which brands of beer can be served at the festival. There are currently only 6 breweries whose beer meets the criteria. In doing so they must adhere to the Bavarian Purity Laws established for beer brewing in 1487 and the beers must be brewed within Munich city limits. Check out more details on the breweries here .\xa0  At the 2015 festival alone, a whopping 7.7 million liters of beer were consumed. A typical beer costs between €9.70 and €10.10 and is sold in the tents between the hours of 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. during the weekdays and between 9 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

Hekla is Iceland\'s most active volcano; Hekla is also a common female name in Iceland.  In 1963 a new volcano appeared in the Atlantic close to Iceland.

Supernatural Iceland  Elves, trolls and ghosts  Surveys show that despite their obsession with modern technology, as many as 80% of Icelanders believe in the existence of elves. Even today, roads have been rerouted and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.  All around the country, strange lava formations were once explained in folktales as trolls who were turned to stone when caught outdoors in daylight. But only children in Iceland believe in trolls today, and the once widespread belief in ghosts is in decline, some say because electricity has taken the fright out of the long winter nights.

Reindeer live in the wild in east Iceland, but were only imported in the 18th century. Mink have also adapted to the wild, the descendants of animals which escaped from fur farms in the 1930s.

Many of these rare breeds have disappeared elsewhere and are the original decedents brought over by the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, cow, sheep and sheepdog.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Author: Jordan Golson. Jordan Golson Gear  Date of Publication: 04.16.15.  Time of Publication: 2:08 pm.  2:08 pm  The 10 Most Walkable Cities in America  Mitchell Funk/Getty  Cities that make life easier for pedestrians are, to many, better places to live. Studies have shown that walkable urban areas are healthier, wealthier and safer (perhaps in part because wealthy people can afford to live in nicer places)—and anyway, who doesn’t want to go outside every once in a while?  If getting around without a car appeals, you should head to New York City or San Francisco (if you can afford either). That’s according to a new ranking of the most walkable large US cities by Redfin, a real estate analysis website and brokerage.  The site uses something it calls Walk Score, an algorithm to measure how convenient it is to do daily errands without wheels, on a 100-point scale. It doesn’t take into account public transit systems (there’s a different score for that), but looks at things like the walking distance to schools, restaurants, and grocery stores, from any given point.  “It’s a population-rated average, sampled at every block,” explains Matt Lerner, VP of products at Redfin. “We’re basically sampling the walk score for every block in the city, weighted by the number of people who live there.” Cities are scored by where the population is, and aren’t penalized for non-walkable areas like shipping ports, industrial districts, and airports.  Most of the cities in the Redfin top 10 are unsurprising. NYC, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington D.C. all got big before the automobile age, so they were made for moving on foot. But the top scores for Miami, Oakland, and Seattle point to the fact that history isn’t all that matters. Cities can change to cater to pedestrians instead of, or at least in addition to, cars.  Lots of cities have become more pedestrian-friendly since Redfin’s last rankings, in 2011. Four years ago, New York City and San Francisco had basically the same score (about 85). Now, the Big Apple’s several points up, thanks to pro-walking efforts like booting cars out of Times Square, Lerner says.  Detroit didn’t crack the top ten, but its score went up 2.2 points, to 52.2, in part thanks to the downtown arrival of big companies like Quicken Loans, bringing restaurants, shops, and businesses with them. New Orleans’ score rose nearly a point, as it develops more affordable housing and revitalizes commercial districts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Miami has seen a surge of development, with new mixed-use commercial and residential areas opening up in the past few years. So there’s good news for pedestrians all over the country.

Edith Cresson was born January 27, 1934, in a fashionable Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Her father was a senior civil servant. Raised by a British nanny, she became fluent in the English language. Cresson attended the School of Advanced Commercial Studies, earning a degree in business and later a doctorate in demography.  A successful businesswoman, she added a second career in politics when she met François Mitterrand in 1965. For the next 26 years the future president helped Cresson advance through the ranks of what is now the French Socialist Party, calling her "my little soldier."  After Mitterrand became president in 1981, Cresson served first as minister of agriculture (1981-1983), then as minister of external trade and tourism (1983-1984), as minister of industrial restructuring and external trade (1984-1986), and finally minister of foreign affairs (1988-1990). She resigned from the government on October 3, 1990, to work as a consultant on international development. Meanwhile she was three times elected a deputy to the National Assembly from the Vienne province (1981, 1986, 1988).  Then in May 1991, President Mitterrand asked Cresson to form a new government. Some experts believe Mitterand had grown dissatisfied with the failures of the government of Michel Rocard to gain majorities in the National Assembly.   Others believe the French president foresaw major international trade issues looming as the trans-European Union came into existence, and sought Cresson\'s expertise in trade affairs.  As prime minister, the combative Cresson planned to strengthen France\'s industrial power and to "protect" French and European trade from the inroads of Japanese and American products. In assembling her new cabinet of 29 members she chose a number of holdovers from the government of her predecessor. One, Pierre Brgovoy, was named to head a new superministry combining economic, trade, industrial, and technology affairs. His appointment served to restore trust in the French leadership in financial markets. She also appointed five women, three to posts in labor, development, and youth and sports.  When her appointment to prime minister drew misogynist remarks from some politicians of France\'s center and right parties, Cresson said, "Men are not in any sense irreplaceable except in one\'s private life." Nevertheless, more fair-minded criticism about her ability to command majorities in the National Assembly persisted.  The Cresson government moved aggressively to free what had become a stagnant economy, and on contentious domestic issues, frequently centered around immigrants. Quoted making strident and antagonistic comments about the Japanese "strategy of conquest," Cresson was greatly concerned over what she was convinced to be Japan\'s major threat to European trade and commonwealth. Diplomatically, her outspokenness was creating unease in international circles. Within four months of becoming president, the Cresson government had fallen precipitously in popularity. Subtle and not-so-subtle attacks on her gender continued, including a popular daytime television show featuring two puppet characters, one a sexy and servile female broadly seen as a Cresson parody. In April 1992, Cresson resigned. Since then she has served as Commissioner for Science, Research and Development to the European Commission.  Cresson\'s husband, Jacques, a retired executive of Peugeot, the French automobile and appliance company, remained supportive of his wife, and their relationship has been likened to that of Margaret Thatcher and her husband. Cresson has been compared to the British prime minister for her bluntness, energy, and stubbornness. They have two daughters.  Further Reading on Edith Cresson  The appointment and career of Cresson was covered in the Washington Post (May 16 and May 18, 1991). See also "An Iron Lady Across the Channel?"

Travolta earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as 19-year-old Tony Manero, who during the week toils in a Brooklyn, New York hardware store and on the weekend dons a white suit and becomes king of a discotheque called 2001 Odyssey. Tony takes great care in his appearance, at one point during the film uttering the now-famous line: “Would ya just watch the hair. Ya know, I work on my hair a long time and you hit it. He hits my hair.” Music played an essential role in Saturday Night Fever, and the film’s soundtrack, which featured a number of songs by the Bee Gees, including “Stayin’ Alive,” “Night Fever,” “How Deep is Your Love” and “Jive Talkin,” became one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time. Saturday Night Fever was one of Gene Siskel’s favorite films. The prominent film critic (who died in 1999) reportedly watched the movie at least 17 times and even purchased the now-iconic white polyester suit Travolta wore while strutting across the lighted dance floor.  Prior to Saturday Night Fever, John Travolta, who was born on February 18, 1954, in Englewood, New Jersey, appeared in the 1976 horror film Carrie, starring Sissy Spacek, and the 1976 made-for-TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. He was best known, however, for his role as Vinnie Barbarino, a remedial high school student who employs the catchphrase “Up your nose with a rubber hose” on the TV sitcom Welcome Back Kotter, which originally aired from 1975 to 1979. After Saturday Night Fever propelled him to international stardom, Travolta followed up with another huge box-office hit, the 1978 big-screen adaptation of the musical Grease. In his role as 1950s-era bad boy Danny to co-star Olivia Newton-John’s good girl Sandy, Travolta charmed audiences with his singing and dancing. Grease was the highest-grossing film of 1978 as well as the highest-grossing movie musical of all time. Following Grease, Travolta helped spark another craze–this time for country music–with the 1980 box-office hit Urban Cowboy, co-starring Debra Winger.  During the 1980s, Travolta starred in a string of mediocre movies, including Staying Alive (1983), a sequel to Saturday Night Fever that was directed and co-written by Sylvester Stallone, Two of a Kind (1983), a romantic comedy that reteamed the actor with Newton-John, and Perfect (1985), about the health-club scene in Los Angeles. In 1994, Travolta staged a comeback when he appeared as the pony-tailed hitman Vincent Vega in writer-director Quentin Tarantino’s crime drama Pulp Fiction. The film, which included a now-famous scene in which Travolta’s character enters a dance contest and does the twist with his boss’s wife (played by Uma Thurman) earned Travolta his second Best Actor Oscar nomination and put him back on Hollywood’s A-list. Following Pulp Fiction, Travolta starred in such movies as Get Shorty (1995), Face/Off (1997), Primary Colors (1998), A Civil Action (1998), Swordfish (2001) and the movie musical Hairspray (2007), in which he dressed in drag to play Edna Turnblad.  Off screen, Travolta, who has been married to the actress Kelly Preston since 1991, is also a certified pilot and owns a fleet of planes.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character . '' The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt ; Depp believes that the character `` was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair , through his fingernails and eyes '' .

In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C.

A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole , but when first constrained , the cats took a long time to get out . With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently , so the cats escaped more and more quickly . Thorndike generalized this finding in his law of effect , which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated .

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur. More than 100,000 Japanese soldiers surrounded the port city, digging kilometres of trenches and attacking the city’s fortifications with gunfire | Question: The navy from which country destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur after a number of attacks in 1904 and 1905?', ['japan'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2812'), ("Context: Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle , said to be the real Santa Claus .

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria\'s approach was           significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte           Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste           Libeault of the Nancy           School . Faria\'s theoretical position, and the subsequent           experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant           contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of mile           Cou and the autogenic training techniques of Johannes           Heinrich Schultz .  Reichenbach  Rcamier, in 1821, prior to the           development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used           something resembling hypnoanesthesia and operated on patients under mesmeric coma.  In the 1840s and 1850s , Carl           Reichenbach began experiments to find any scientific validity to "mesmeric" energy, which he termed Odic           force after the Norse god Odin.

Travolta earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as 19-year-old Tony Manero, who during the week toils in a Brooklyn, New York hardware store and on the weekend dons a white suit and becomes king of a discotheque called 2001 Odyssey. Tony takes great care in his appearance, at one point during the film uttering the now-famous line: “Would ya just watch the hair. Ya know, I work on my hair a long time and you hit it. He hits my hair.” Music played an essential role in Saturday Night Fever, and the film’s soundtrack, which featured a number of songs by the Bee Gees, including “Stayin’ Alive,” “Night Fever,” “How Deep is Your Love” and “Jive Talkin,” became one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time. Saturday Night Fever was one of Gene Siskel’s favorite films. The prominent film critic (who died in 1999) reportedly watched the movie at least 17 times and even purchased the now-iconic white polyester suit Travolta wore while strutting across the lighted dance floor.  Prior to Saturday Night Fever, John Travolta, who was born on February 18, 1954, in Englewood, New Jersey, appeared in the 1976 horror film Carrie, starring Sissy Spacek, and the 1976 made-for-TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. He was best known, however, for his role as Vinnie Barbarino, a remedial high school student who employs the catchphrase “Up your nose with a rubber hose” on the TV sitcom Welcome Back Kotter, which originally aired from 1975 to 1979. After Saturday Night Fever propelled him to international stardom, Travolta followed up with another huge box-office hit, the 1978 big-screen adaptation of the musical Grease. In his role as 1950s-era bad boy Danny to co-star Olivia Newton-John’s good girl Sandy, Travolta charmed audiences with his singing and dancing. Grease was the highest-grossing film of 1978 as well as the highest-grossing movie musical of all time. Following Grease, Travolta helped spark another craze–this time for country music–with the 1980 box-office hit Urban Cowboy, co-starring Debra Winger.  During the 1980s, Travolta starred in a string of mediocre movies, including Staying Alive (1983), a sequel to Saturday Night Fever that was directed and co-written by Sylvester Stallone, Two of a Kind (1983), a romantic comedy that reteamed the actor with Newton-John, and Perfect (1985), about the health-club scene in Los Angeles. In 1994, Travolta staged a comeback when he appeared as the pony-tailed hitman Vincent Vega in writer-director Quentin Tarantino’s crime drama Pulp Fiction. The film, which included a now-famous scene in which Travolta’s character enters a dance contest and does the twist with his boss’s wife (played by Uma Thurman) earned Travolta his second Best Actor Oscar nomination and put him back on Hollywood’s A-list. Following Pulp Fiction, Travolta starred in such movies as Get Shorty (1995), Face/Off (1997), Primary Colors (1998), A Civil Action (1998), Swordfish (2001) and the movie musical Hairspray (2007), in which he dressed in drag to play Edna Turnblad.  Off screen, Travolta, who has been married to the actress Kelly Preston since 1991, is also a certified pilot and owns a fleet of planes.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

She said , `` When we were kids , my mum would pop it in the VCR player . We would be disturbed , and would n't really understand it , but we could n't look away because it was too intriguing . So I had kept that feeling about Alice , a kind of haunting feeling . '' Although facing pressures to conform to society 's expectations , Alice grows into a stronger - willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path ; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls , describing the character as `` stubborn , brave , ( and ) non-girlie '' . Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six - year - old girl .   Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp , The Mad Hatter . Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character . '' The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt ; Depp believes that the character `` was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair , through his fingernails and eyes '' . Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C. Nesbitt character ) reflecting a darker , more dangerous personality . Illusionary dancer David `` Elsewhere '' Bernal doubled for Depp during the `` Futterwacken '' sequence near the end of the film .   Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims , the Red Queen . She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters : the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts . Her first name is a play on the word irascible because she is easily irritated , obstreperous , impatient , and quick to anger . Bonham Carter 's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen . The character hates animals , and chooses to use them as servants and furniture . It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband , the King . The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell , a toddler , stating that , `` The Red Queen is just like a toddler , because she 's got a big head and she 's a tyrant . ''   Anne Hathaway as Mirana of Marmoreal , the White Queen . She was one of few characters that did not require digital manipulation . Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife ; `` Cute but psycho . Things even out . '' According to Hathaway , `` She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen . She really likes the dark side , but she 's so scared of going too far into it that she 's made everything appear very light and happy . But she 's living in that place out of fear that she wo n't be able to control herself . '' Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as `` a punk - rock vegan pacifist '' , with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry , Greta Garbo , and the artwork of Dan Flavin . Burton said that the White Queen 's appearance was inspired by Nigella Lawson .

A cat could escape from the box by a simple response such as pulling a cord or pushing a pole , but when first constrained , the cats took a long time to get out . With repeated trials ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more frequently , so the cats escaped more and more quickly . Thorndike generalized this finding in his law of effect , which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated .

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient.

UPS has used brown-painted vehicles since the 1920s; by at least the 1980s, UPS became known as “Big Brown.”  UPS has so many vehicles operating in New York City that it’s almost always the top recipient of parking tickets.  Wikipedia: United Parcel Service  United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS), colloquially referred to as UPS, is a package delivery company. Headquartered in Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States, UPS delivers more than 15 million packages a day to 6.1 million customers in more than 220 countries and territories around the world.  UPS is well known for its brown trucks, internally known as package cars (hence the company nickname “The Big Brown Machine"). UPS also operates its own airline (IATA: 5X, ICAO: UPS, Call sign: UPS) based in Louisville, Kentucky.  (...)  Brown  The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman Brown. The color is also mentioned in their former advertising slogan: “What can Brown do for you?” Originally founder James E.

GK Hart/Vikki Hart/Photodisc/ Getty Images  In all of history, no cow is more infamous than Mrs. O'Leary's. The farm animal was accused of kicking over a lantern and starting the Great Chicago Fire on Oct. 8, 1871. The fire , despite its humble origins in a barn, was ferocious. It destroyed 3.5 square miles of the city and left 120 people dead and thousands more homeless . Losses were estimated at $200 million [source: Gove ].  Mrs. O'Leary lived with her husband and five children at 137 DeKoven Street in Chicago. The O'Learys were a poor family; Mr. O'Leary worked as a laborer, and Mrs. O'Leary kept her infamous cows in a backyard barn and sold their milk to the neighbors.  Up Next  Was there a real John Henry?  After the fire, newspapers immediately pointed fingers at Mrs. O'Leary. The Chicago Tribune claimed that Mrs. O'Leary had a motive for starting the fire. She'd been on welfare, but when the city learned that she sold milk on the side, it cut her off. In response, the peeved Mrs. O'Leary swore her vengeance on the city, the paper claimed. And now she'd had her retribution.  Other newspapers were a bit more gracious. They reported that the fire was an accident -- that a kerosene lamp was knocked over during milking, either by the cow or by Mrs. O'Leary.  Mrs. O'Leary maintained, however, that her entire family was asleep in the house when the fire started. The official inquiry into the fire -- despite its over one thousand pages of testimony -- did not determine the exact cause of the fire. But the damage to Mrs. O'Leary was done, and she and her cow have lived on in Chicago legend.  Historians generally agree that the fire started in the barn behind the O'Leary home. But did the cow really kick over a lantern? Was someone besides Mrs. O'Leary to blame? Several other characters lurk on the edges of this crime scene. Let's take a look at these possible culprits on the next page.  Why did the fire spread so quickly?  Regardless of how the fire started, why weren't the fire fighters able to put it out? In the case of the Chicago fire, it was one heaping of bad luck after another. Chicago was unusually dry that summer, and there was a strong wind on the night of Oct. 8. At the time, about 90 percent of the buildings were constructed of wood, connected by 56 miles of wooden streets and 561 miles of sidewalks [source: Fedler]. For a city of 300,000, there were only 200 firemen. And they have fought a huge fire the night before, which resulted in damaged equipment and exhausted men. Some of the fire engines went to the wrong address. The fire destroyed the building that stored the city's water pumps, and attempts to draw water from Lake Michigan failed. The fire raged through Chicago until burning out the following evening, aided by the first significant rainfall in months.  1  Did Mrs. O'Leary's Cow Start the Great Chicago Fire?Did Mrs. O'Leary's Cow Start the Great Chicago Fire?

Review by Steven Suskin                             from Variety  Frequently Asked Questions  about La Cage aux Folles  What Is La Cage aux Folles Like?  This beloved 1983 musical hit has been scaled down—the stage of Broadway’s Longacre Theatre doubles as that of the La Cage nightclub, and the first few rows of the orchestra have been replaced with bistro tables. (Choose these seats if you like the idea of interacting with the characters.) Six “Cagelles” (men in drag) perform lively musical numbers to Jerry Herman’s Tony-winning score, and Harvey Fierstein’s book is as hilarious as ever. But the heart of the show is its touching portrayal of Georges and Albin’s enduring love. As the song says, “The Best of Times” is always now to see La Cage aux Folles.  Is La Cage aux Folles Good For Kids?  If you don\'t mind taking your kids to a nightclub featuring bawdy drag queens and comfortable-in-their-skin gay men (who kiss!), absolutely! School-age kids will embrace La Cage’s slapstick humor (including the comic antics of Albin’s "maid" Jacob) and will identify with Jean-Michel’s plight in feeling pulled between a desire to impress his girlfriend and loyalty to his sometimes embarrassing parents. The family at the center of the show may be unconventional, but their devotion to one another makes a strong statement about family values.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

Johnson appoints a special commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which had occurred a week earlier, on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.  According to his memoirs and biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson knew he had to provide strong leadership in the wake of the shocking murder of President Kennedy. One of his first official acts was to initiate an investigation into the assassination. Johnson later wrote that, in the weeks after the assassination, the American public, and the government that he now headed was in a state of confusion and disorientation “like a bunch of cattle caught in a swamp.” He felt the weight of his new responsibility keenly “in a world that is never more than minutes away from catastrophe” and knew that “the whole world would be anxiously following every move I made.”  On November 29, Johnson issued Executive Order No. 11130, appointing the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy–commonly referred to as the Warren Commission, after its leader, Chief Justice Earl Warren. Since the president’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was himself killed by Jack Ruby almost immediately after Oswald killed Kennedy, details of Oswald’s motive for the assassination remained murky.  During its almost year-long investigation, the Warren Commission reviewed reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, Department of State and the attorney general of Texas. It also poured over Oswald’s personal history, political affiliation and military record. Overall, the Warren Commission listened to the testimony of 552 witnesses and even traveled to Dallas several times to visit the site where Kennedy was shot. The commission concluded that Oswald had acted alone and that the Secret Service had made poor preparations for JFK’s visit to Dallas and had subsequently failed to sufficiently protect him.  The circumstances surrounding Kennedy’s death, however, have since given rise to several conspiracy theories involving such disparate characters as the Mafia, Cuban exiles, military leaders and even President Johnson. The Warren Commission’s conclusion that Oswald was a “lone gunman” failed to satisfy some who witnessed the attack and others whose research found conflicting details in the commission’s report. Critics of the Warren Commission’s report believed that additional ballistics experts’ conclusions and a home movie shot at the scene disputed the theory that three bullets fired from Oswald’s gun could have caused Kennedy’s fatal wounds as well as the injuries to Texas Governor John Connally, who was riding with the president in an open car as it traveled through Dallas’ Dealey Plaza that fateful day. So persistent was the controversy that another congressional investigation was conducted in 1979. That committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots that killed the president and that the Secret Service failed to protect Kennedy. It did, however, also allow for the possibility that a second gunman might have been involved, but did not pursue the matter further.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4.

Mount Meager is a potentially active volcano in the Canadian province of British Columbia , Canada , 150 kilometers north of Vancouver . The top of the mountain is mostly covered by snow and glaciers . It lies in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is the northernmost volcano of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that extends down to northern California . Its most common type of rock is lava that is almost a million years old (with a thickness in some places over 1\xa0km).  The mountain is part of the Pacific Ranges of mountains and is 2,680 meters (8,793 feet) high. It was previously called Cathedral Mountain.  Geologic history  Meager is known for its last major eruption about 2,350 years ago. The strange thing about the eruption was the fact it released the debris from the northeast side of the volcano, as rock and ash blocked a major river called the Lillooet River . The river was dammed to a height of at least 100 meters, forming a lake . The lake reached a maximum elevation of 810 meters and was at least 50 meters deep. The breccia soon eroded from water activity within the lake, forming Keyhole Falls. There was a massive flood when the water first broke through the breccia, carrying small house sized blocks of breccia. During this eruption, ash was hurled into the air over 20 kilometers above sea level. The ash was carried eastward as far as Alberta .  Volcanic hazards  Meager is an unstable volcano. It is built of unstable volcanic and has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Perberton Valley at least three times during the last 7,300 years. Two earlier debris flows, around 4,450 and 7,300 years ago, sent rubble at least 32 kilometers from the volcano. Recently, the volcano has created smaller landslides about every ten years, including one in 1975 that killed four geologists near Meager Creek. Logging, mining, tourism and wilderness recreation on nearby slopes and valleys are vulnerable to the volcano’s excellent geomorphic activity. The possibility of Mount Meager covering settled parts of the Pemberton Valley in a debris flow is estimated at about one in 2400 years. There is no sign of volcanic eruptions with these events, however scientists warn the volcano could release another massive debris flow over populated areas anytime without warning.  The explosive nature of past eruptions at Mount Meager indicates that this volcano also poses a considerable long-distance treat to communities across southern British Columbia and Alberta. It is also a local treat to the town of Pemberton, British Columbia, about 50\xa0km away. Another explosive eruption at Mount Meager would also have a considerable impact on local mining and logging operations, as well as significant negative impacts on the Lillooet River fishery.

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ("Context: Andrew Clement Serkis ( born 20 April 1964 ) is an English actor and director .

His works include the musical comedies Kiss Me, Kate, Fifty Million Frenchmen, DuBarry Was a Lady and Anything Goes, as well as songs like "Night and Day", "I Get a Kick out of You", "Well, Did You Evah!" and "I\'ve Got You Under My Skin". He was noted for his sophisticated bawdy lyrics, clever rhymes, and complex forms. He was one of the greatest contributors to the Great American Songbook. Cole Porter is one of the few Tin Pan Alley composers to have written both lyrics and music for his songs.  Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, to a wealthy Baptist family;[1] his maternal grandfather, James Omar "J.O." Cole, was a coal and timber speculator who dominated his daughter\'s family. His mother started Porter in musical training at an early age; he learned the violin at age six, the piano at eight, and he wrote his first operetta (with help from his mother) at 10. Porter\'s mother, Kate, recognized and supported her son\'s talents. She changed his legal birth year from 1891 to 1893 to make him appear more precocious. Porter\'s grandfather.  I Get a Kick Out of You"I Get a Kick out of You" is a song by Cole Porter, which was first sung in the 1934 Broadway musical Anything Goes, and then in the 1936 film version. Originally sung by Ethel Merman, it has been covered by dozens of prominent performers, including Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.  A cover in 1995 won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement with Accompanying Vocal(s) for arranger Rob McConnell.  Alterations to the song  The lyrics were first altered shortly after being written. The last verse originally went as follows:  I get no kick in a plane  I shouldn\'t care for those nights in the air  That the fair Mrs. Lindbergh goes through  But I get a kick out of you.  After the 1932 Lindbergh kidnapping,  Porter changed the second and third lines to:  Flying too high with some guy in the sky  Is my idea of nothing to do  In the 1936 movie version, alternative lyrics in the second verse were provided to replace a reference to the drug cocaine, which was not allowed by Hollywood\'s Production Code of 1934.

However, each contestant must attempt to smuggle five strange-but-true facts past the rest of the panel, hoping that no-one will notice what they have said is the unbelievable truth.

But it is important. Just as Cicero went through a phase where he used to begin every speech to the senate with the line "Carthage must be destroyed", so I have to say, far more often than I would like: Radio 4\'s comedy output needs a really big overhaul.  There are programmes that ring their own leper-bells, so you know you can avoid them. An all too typical example is Laura Solon: Talking and Not Talking, which goes out at 11.30pm on Wednesdays. The description given on the BBC\'s iPlayer includes the words "packed with bittersweet character monologues and cuttingly modern sketches", which is another way, as even the most cursorily experienced listener will recognise, of saying "not very funny". It illustrates the inverse formula given by Tolstoy about happy and unhappy families: all funny radio sketch shows are funny in different ways, but all unfunny ones are unfunny in the same way. I mean, how many different ways are there of being unfunny?  With marginally more potential, but not much more success, is DoubleScience (Wednesdays, 6.30pm), "a sitcom about two incompetent science teachers who work at a college that specialises in drama". "Incompetent" could fit the bill, in that one of the science teachers concerned, looking at a new poster of the periodic table, observes that radon sounds like something you\'d put in your washing machine. But never mind the marginal desirability of putting this weak joke in the script at all, how likely is it that a science teacher, however incompetent, would say such a thing?  Here is the sport the show makes about the teachers: they like real ale; they play Dungeons and Dragons; they are unsuccessful with women; they have undesirable living quarters; and they speak in comedy voices, one a bit like Neil from The Young Ones and the other like John Major. There is, for good measure, the proprietor of an Indian restaurant who addresses his clientele as "gentlemens".  By fluke rather than by design, my children and I have listened to the last two of these shows. Last week, the eldest, who until then had been in quite a sunny mood, suddenly lost all her joie de vivre and said, "Is this the one that\'s supposed to be funny but isn\'t?" "Let\'s give it a chance," I said. Thirty laugh-free minutes later, the children were looking defeated and mistrustful.  Also conceptually problematic is The Unbelievable Truth which, thanks to presenter David Mitchell and the calibre of many of the guests (Graeme Garden, Tony Hawks), cannot fail to raise a laugh from time to time; but the very format of the show, which is too boring to write out, means that contestants are too busy paying attention to the others\' flights of fancy to fabricate jokes. Its format is also a regression from the principles of I\'m Sorry, I Haven\'t a Clue, which was billed, you will recall, as "the antidote to panel games".  The funniest show on radio, then, for the last few weeks, has been David Quantick\'s The Blagger\'s Guide (Radio 2), whose run is now sadly over.

GK Hart/Vikki Hart/Photodisc/ Getty Images  In all of history, no cow is more infamous than Mrs. O'Leary's. The farm animal was accused of kicking over a lantern and starting the Great Chicago Fire on Oct. 8, 1871. The fire , despite its humble origins in a barn, was ferocious. It destroyed 3.5 square miles of the city and left 120 people dead and thousands more homeless . Losses were estimated at $200 million [source: Gove ].  Mrs. O'Leary lived with her husband and five children at 137 DeKoven Street in Chicago. The O'Learys were a poor family; Mr. O'Leary worked as a laborer, and Mrs. O'Leary kept her infamous cows in a backyard barn and sold their milk to the neighbors.  Up Next  Was there a real John Henry?  After the fire, newspapers immediately pointed fingers at Mrs. O'Leary. The Chicago Tribune claimed that Mrs. O'Leary had a motive for starting the fire. She'd been on welfare, but when the city learned that she sold milk on the side, it cut her off. In response, the peeved Mrs. O'Leary swore her vengeance on the city, the paper claimed. And now she'd had her retribution.  Other newspapers were a bit more gracious. They reported that the fire was an accident -- that a kerosene lamp was knocked over during milking, either by the cow or by Mrs. O'Leary.  Mrs. O'Leary maintained, however, that her entire family was asleep in the house when the fire started. The official inquiry into the fire -- despite its over one thousand pages of testimony -- did not determine the exact cause of the fire. But the damage to Mrs. O'Leary was done, and she and her cow have lived on in Chicago legend.  Historians generally agree that the fire started in the barn behind the O'Leary home. But did the cow really kick over a lantern? Was someone besides Mrs. O'Leary to blame? Several other characters lurk on the edges of this crime scene. Let's take a look at these possible culprits on the next page.  Why did the fire spread so quickly?  Regardless of how the fire started, why weren't the fire fighters able to put it out? In the case of the Chicago fire, it was one heaping of bad luck after another. Chicago was unusually dry that summer, and there was a strong wind on the night of Oct. 8. At the time, about 90 percent of the buildings were constructed of wood, connected by 56 miles of wooden streets and 561 miles of sidewalks [source: Fedler]. For a city of 300,000, there were only 200 firemen. And they have fought a huge fire the night before, which resulted in damaged equipment and exhausted men. Some of the fire engines went to the wrong address. The fire destroyed the building that stored the city's water pumps, and attempts to draw water from Lake Michigan failed. The fire raged through Chicago until burning out the following evening, aided by the first significant rainfall in months.  1  Did Mrs. O'Leary's Cow Start the Great Chicago Fire?Did Mrs. O'Leary's Cow Start the Great Chicago Fire?

This beloved 1983 musical hit has been scaled down—the stage of Broadway’s Longacre Theatre doubles as that of the La Cage nightclub, and the first few rows of the orchestra have been replaced with bistro tables. (Choose these seats if you like the idea of interacting with the characters.) Six “Cagelles” (men in drag) perform lively musical numbers to Jerry Herman’s Tony-winning score, and Harvey Fierstein’s book is as hilarious as ever. But the heart of the show is its touching portrayal of Georges and Albin’s enduring love. As the song says, “The Best of Times” is always now to see La Cage aux Folles.  Is La Cage aux Folles Good For Kids?  If you don\'t mind taking your kids to a nightclub featuring bawdy drag queens and comfortable-in-their-skin gay men (who kiss!), absolutely! School-age kids will embrace La Cage’s slapstick humor (including the comic antics of Albin’s "maid" Jacob) and will identify with Jean-Michel’s plight in feeling pulled between a desire to impress his girlfriend and loyalty to his sometimes embarrassing parents. The family at the center of the show may be unconventional, but their devotion to one another makes a strong statement about family values.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

Johnson appoints a special commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which had occurred a week earlier, on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.  According to his memoirs and biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson knew he had to provide strong leadership in the wake of the shocking murder of President Kennedy. One of his first official acts was to initiate an investigation into the assassination. Johnson later wrote that, in the weeks after the assassination, the American public, and the government that he now headed was in a state of confusion and disorientation “like a bunch of cattle caught in a swamp.” He felt the weight of his new responsibility keenly “in a world that is never more than minutes away from catastrophe” and knew that “the whole world would be anxiously following every move I made.”  On November 29, Johnson issued Executive Order No. 11130, appointing the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy–commonly referred to as the Warren Commission, after its leader, Chief Justice Earl Warren. Since the president’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was himself killed by Jack Ruby almost immediately after Oswald killed Kennedy, details of Oswald’s motive for the assassination remained murky.  During its almost year-long investigation, the Warren Commission reviewed reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, Department of State and the attorney general of Texas. It also poured over Oswald’s personal history, political affiliation and military record. Overall, the Warren Commission listened to the testimony of 552 witnesses and even traveled to Dallas several times to visit the site where Kennedy was shot. The commission concluded that Oswald had acted alone and that the Secret Service had made poor preparations for JFK’s visit to Dallas and had subsequently failed to sufficiently protect him.  The circumstances surrounding Kennedy’s death, however, have since given rise to several conspiracy theories involving such disparate characters as the Mafia, Cuban exiles, military leaders and even President Johnson. The Warren Commission’s conclusion that Oswald was a “lone gunman” failed to satisfy some who witnessed the attack and others whose research found conflicting details in the commission’s report. Critics of the Warren Commission’s report believed that additional ballistics experts’ conclusions and a home movie shot at the scene disputed the theory that three bullets fired from Oswald’s gun could have caused Kennedy’s fatal wounds as well as the injuries to Texas Governor John Connally, who was riding with the president in an open car as it traveled through Dallas’ Dealey Plaza that fateful day. So persistent was the controversy that another congressional investigation was conducted in 1979. That committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots that killed the president and that the Secret Service failed to protect Kennedy. It did, however, also allow for the possibility that a second gunman might have been involved, but did not pursue the matter further.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4.

Mount Meager is a potentially active volcano in the Canadian province of British Columbia , Canada , 150 kilometers north of Vancouver . The top of the mountain is mostly covered by snow and glaciers . It lies in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is the northernmost volcano of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that extends down to northern California . Its most common type of rock is lava that is almost a million years old (with a thickness in some places over 1\xa0km).  The mountain is part of the Pacific Ranges of mountains and is 2,680 meters (8,793 feet) high. It was previously called Cathedral Mountain.  Geologic history  Meager is known for its last major eruption about 2,350 years ago. The strange thing about the eruption was the fact it released the debris from the northeast side of the volcano, as rock and ash blocked a major river called the Lillooet River . The river was dammed to a height of at least 100 meters, forming a lake . The lake reached a maximum elevation of 810 meters and was at least 50 meters deep. The breccia soon eroded from water activity within the lake, forming Keyhole Falls. There was a massive flood when the water first broke through the breccia, carrying small house sized blocks of breccia. During this eruption, ash was hurled into the air over 20 kilometers above sea level. The ash was carried eastward as far as Alberta .  Volcanic hazards  Meager is an unstable volcano. It is built of unstable volcanic and has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Perberton Valley at least three times during the last 7,300 years. Two earlier debris flows, around 4,450 and 7,300 years ago, sent rubble at least 32 kilometers from the volcano. Recently, the volcano has created smaller landslides about every ten years, including one in 1975 that killed four geologists near Meager Creek. Logging, mining, tourism and wilderness recreation on nearby slopes and valleys are vulnerable to the volcano’s excellent geomorphic activity. The possibility of Mount Meager covering settled parts of the Pemberton Valley in a debris flow is estimated at about one in 2400 years. There is no sign of volcanic eruptions with these events, however scientists warn the volcano could release another massive debris flow over populated areas anytime without warning.  The explosive nature of past eruptions at Mount Meager indicates that this volcano also poses a considerable long-distance treat to communities across southern British Columbia and Alberta. It is also a local treat to the town of Pemberton, British Columbia, about 50\xa0km away. Another explosive eruption at Mount Meager would also have a considerable impact on local mining and logging operations, as well as significant negative impacts on the Lillooet River fishery.

The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ("Context: Andrew Clement Serkis ( born 20 April 1964 ) is an English actor and director .

He was noted for his sophisticated bawdy lyrics, clever rhymes, and complex forms. He was one of the greatest contributors to the Great American Songbook. Cole Porter is one of the few Tin Pan Alley composers to have written both lyrics and music for his songs.  Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, to a wealthy Baptist family;[1] his maternal grandfather, James Omar "J.O." Cole, was a coal and timber speculator who dominated his daughter\'s family. His mother started Porter in musical training at an early age; he learned the violin at age six, the piano at eight, and he wrote his first operetta (with help from his mother) at 10. Porter\'s mother, Kate, recognized and supported her son\'s talents. She changed his legal birth year from 1891 to 1893 to make him appear more precocious. Porter\'s grandfather.

However, each contestant must attempt to smuggle five strange-but-true facts past the rest of the panel, hoping that no-one will notice what they have said is the unbelievable truth.

But it is important. Just as Cicero went through a phase where he used to begin every speech to the senate with the line "Carthage must be destroyed", so I have to say, far more often than I would like: Radio 4\'s comedy output needs a really big overhaul.  There are programmes that ring their own leper-bells, so you know you can avoid them. An all too typical example is Laura Solon: Talking and Not Talking, which goes out at 11.30pm on Wednesdays. The description given on the BBC\'s iPlayer includes the words "packed with bittersweet character monologues and cuttingly modern sketches", which is another way, as even the most cursorily experienced listener will recognise, of saying "not very funny". It illustrates the inverse formula given by Tolstoy about happy and unhappy families: all funny radio sketch shows are funny in different ways, but all unfunny ones are unfunny in the same way. I mean, how many different ways are there of being unfunny?  With marginally more potential, but not much more success, is DoubleScience (Wednesdays, 6.30pm), "a sitcom about two incompetent science teachers who work at a college that specialises in drama". "Incompetent" could fit the bill, in that one of the science teachers concerned, looking at a new poster of the periodic table, observes that radon sounds like something you\'d put in your washing machine. But never mind the marginal desirability of putting this weak joke in the script at all, how likely is it that a science teacher, however incompetent, would say such a thing?  Here is the sport the show makes about the teachers: they like real ale; they play Dungeons and Dragons; they are unsuccessful with women; they have undesirable living quarters; and they speak in comedy voices, one a bit like Neil from The Young Ones and the other like John Major. There is, for good measure, the proprietor of an Indian restaurant who addresses his clientele as "gentlemens".  By fluke rather than by design, my children and I have listened to the last two of these shows. Last week, the eldest, who until then had been in quite a sunny mood, suddenly lost all her joie de vivre and said, "Is this the one that\'s supposed to be funny but isn\'t?" "Let\'s give it a chance," I said. Thirty laugh-free minutes later, the children were looking defeated and mistrustful.  Also conceptually problematic is The Unbelievable Truth which, thanks to presenter David Mitchell and the calibre of many of the guests (Graeme Garden, Tony Hawks), cannot fail to raise a laugh from time to time; but the very format of the show, which is too boring to write out, means that contestants are too busy paying attention to the others\' flights of fancy to fabricate jokes. Its format is also a regression from the principles of I\'m Sorry, I Haven\'t a Clue, which was billed, you will recall, as "the antidote to panel games".  The funniest show on radio, then, for the last few weeks, has been David Quantick\'s The Blagger\'s Guide (Radio 2), whose run is now sadly over. But that\'s too music-oriented for Radio 4 | Question: "Who presents ""The Unbelievable Truth"" on BBC Radio 4?" ?', ['david mitchell'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5068')]

They are currently exhibited, free to the public, in the Duveen Gallery in the British Museum. Although today the sculptures appear white, originally they were painted in vivid colors, something that new research is revealing .  A marble frieze from the Parthenon, now displayed in the British Museum, depicts a procession of gods and mortals.  Credit: Mark Higgins Shutterstock  The marbles in London were removed from the Parthenon in the first decade of the 19th century under the auspices of Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin, and were first exhibited in London in 1807. Their removal is deeply controversial and the Greek government has requested that they be repatriated, a debate that has garnered extensive media attention. Not all the sculptures from the Parthenon are in the British Museum; another large portion is still in Athens, while a few other sculptures are in different museums throughout the world.  The Elgin Marbles once adorned the Parthenon in Athens.  Credit: Anastasios71 Shutterstock  The Parthenon  A temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is located on the Acropolis of ancient Athens. It is about 228 feet (69.5 meters) long by 101 feet (30.9 meters) wide and roughly 65 feet (20 meters) high. Construction of the temple started in 447 B.C., with work on its decorations continuing up to about 432 B.C., around the time war broke out with Sparta. At the time the Parthenon was created, Athens was at its height, the city’s vast navy helping it control an empire in the Aegean Sea.  There are three main types of sculptures on the exterior of the Parthenon that are now part of the Elgin Marbles.  Pediments  Pediments are large triangular shaped niches, which contained impressive sculptures, located high up on top of the Parthenon. One pediment is located on the east side of the building and another on the west. The sculptures on the east pediment tell the tale of the birth of the goddess Athena, while those on the west depict a battle between Athena and the god Poseidon to determine who would be the patron deity of Athens. The size of the sculptures varied depending on how close they were to the apex (the highest point) of the triangle.  The most impressive pediment sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles come from the east side and illustrate reactions to the birth of Athena.  According to myth, Athena was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Metis. Zeus was afraid that Athena would become more powerful than him so he swallowed Metis whole while she was pregnant. This did not stop the pregnancy and Athena became so big that Zeus’ head was split open with an axe by the Greek blacksmith god Hephaestus, and the goddess was born.  Unfortunately, the sculptures depicting the head-blowing birth have not survived but the sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles do show the reactions of Greek deities to the birth. British Museum curator Ian Jenkins notes in his book "The Parthenon Sculptures" (Harvard University Press, 2007) that Athena was born “at daybreak” and sculptures show “the sun-god Helios and the heads of two of his four horses,” emerging from the floor of the pediment, rising “as if from the sea.”  Also observing the event is a nude image of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry, who is shown reclining and apparently enjoying a cup of wine, as if toasting the birth. To the right are two seated goddesses who, Jenkins says, are probably Demeter and her daughter Persephone, while further to the right is a heavily draped Greek girl, apparently a mortal human, who has taken flight after viewing the event.

Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule. The United States joined the war on the side of South     Vietnam in 1961, but withdrew combat troops in 1973. In 1975 North Vietnam     succeeded in taking control of South Vietnam.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

Robin Scott-Elliot remembers Torvill and Dean\'s perfect dance in Sarajevo  Tuesday 14 July 2009 23:01 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  The girl was the same height as the wall that enclosed the arena. She held a bouquet in one hand and with the other picked furiously at something stuck on the ice, desperate to ensure the surface was perfect for the two competitors waiting their turn. Out of sight, they watched and a country watched with them, millions upon millions waiting, united in a universal anxiety. Perfection was not to be long delayed.  Satisfied with her precise labours, the girl made for the small gate that led off the ice. Jayne Torvill smiled down at her as she scrambled off, her skates now a clumsy hindrance. Alongside Torvill, Christopher Dean stared ahead, inscrutable, his face a mask of calm, his long slender neck, accentuated by his collarless top, giving him the serene air of a swan on the summer water.  The ice was Dean\'s natural habitat, and, at last, the girl banished contentedly into the depths of the Zetra stadium, he led his partner on to the rink.  The gate was closed behind them and they skated briskly to the centre, the brilliance of the ice and the whitewashed wall blurring the spectators and highlighting Torvill and Dean, each clad in billowing tops of darkening purple, he in black trousers and black skates, she in a short dress, also purple, and white skates. It was the evening of Valentine\'s Day, 1984, and in Sarajevo, the host city of the XIV Winter Olympics, two Britons were on the brink of passing forever into sporting greatness.

Sport may become, as the Olympic movement demands, relentlessly faster, higher, stronger, but grace spans ages, through a Bradman drive to a Cruyff turn and on to a Federer forehand. Torvill and Dean, artists on ice, reached the rare ground of sporting perfection. What is more, under an almost intolerable weight of expectation, they captured a nation.

"An adult human brain has more than 100 billion neurons"  >\xa0100 billion  One of the most remarkable aspects of the adult nervous system is the human brain. The human brain controls memory, vision, learning, thought, consciousness and other activities. By means of electrochemical impulses the brain directly controls conscious or voluntary behavior. It also monitors, through feedback circuitry, most involuntary behavior and influences automatic activities of the internal organs.  During fetal development the foundations of the mind are laid as billions of neurons form appropriate connections and patterns. No aspect of this complicated structure has been left to chance. The basic wiring plan is encoded in the genes. It has been shown from previous studies that in developing embryos of animals, nerve cells are created in or travel to designated regions of the brain, and once in place send out axons along preprogrammed paths to make contact with specific targets.  The brain\'s billions of neurons connect with one another in complex networks. All physical and mental functioning depends on the establishment and maintenance of neuron networks. A person\'s habits and skills -- such as nail-biting or playing a musical instrument -- become embedded within the brain in frequently activated neuron networks. When a person stops performing an activity, the neural networks for the activity fall into disuse and eventually may disappear.  Differences in weight and size of a person\'s brain does not correlate with differences in mental ability. The adult human brain normally weighs from 1.0 to 1.5\xa0kg (2¼ to 3¼\xa0lbs).  The work of the brain is similar to a combination of a computer and a chemical factory. So take good care of your PC!

Search the site  By Kendra Cherry - Reviewed by a board-certified physician.  Updated March 11, 2016  How many neurons are in the human brain? Older estimates have long suggested that 100 billion was the magic number, but some more recent research suggests that the brain actually contains fewer neurons than previously believed.  The human brain is made up of a complex network of neurons . These neurons serve as the building blocks of the nervous system, transmitting information to and from the brain and throughout the body.  You probably expect that a large number of neurons are required for such a complex process, but just how many neurons are there in the human brain?  How Many Neurons are in the Human Brain?  According to many estimates, the human brain contains around 100 billion neurons (give or take a few billion). This estimate has often been reported for many years in neuroscience and psychology textbooks and for many years was simply accepted as a relatively close approximation.  Recently, however, Brazilian researcher Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel discovered that these estimates might not be entirely accurate. While the number is widely cited, she found that no one seemed to know where this number originated. She then decided to investigate in order to determine if the number is accurate. | Question: The human brain is made up of between 10 billion and 100 billion nerve cells known as what?', ['nerve cells', 'neuron', 'neurons'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1877'), ("Context: Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city ...Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city | Daily Mail Online  Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city  comments  Prague is one of Europe's architectural gems, with more knockout picture-postcard views than some entire countries. Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities "by ancient usage" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891.

Scientists discover the ability to bring extinct animals back to life via a complex cloning process. To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.  Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong .  The 1990 book Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton , while the 1993 movie Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg . Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008. But it all worked out, and the fourth film, titled Jurassic World , was released in 2015.

They are currently exhibited, free to the public, in the Duveen Gallery in the British Museum. Although today the sculptures appear white, originally they were painted in vivid colors, something that new research is revealing .  A marble frieze from the Parthenon, now displayed in the British Museum, depicts a procession of gods and mortals.  Credit: Mark Higgins Shutterstock  The marbles in London were removed from the Parthenon in the first decade of the 19th century under the auspices of Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin, and were first exhibited in London in 1807. Their removal is deeply controversial and the Greek government has requested that they be repatriated, a debate that has garnered extensive media attention. Not all the sculptures from the Parthenon are in the British Museum; another large portion is still in Athens, while a few other sculptures are in different museums throughout the world.  The Elgin Marbles once adorned the Parthenon in Athens.  Credit: Anastasios71 Shutterstock  The Parthenon  A temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is located on the Acropolis of ancient Athens. It is about 228 feet (69.5 meters) long by 101 feet (30.9 meters) wide and roughly 65 feet (20 meters) high. Construction of the temple started in 447 B.C., with work on its decorations continuing up to about 432 B.C., around the time war broke out with Sparta. At the time the Parthenon was created, Athens was at its height, the city’s vast navy helping it control an empire in the Aegean Sea.  There are three main types of sculptures on the exterior of the Parthenon that are now part of the Elgin Marbles.  Pediments  Pediments are large triangular shaped niches, which contained impressive sculptures, located high up on top of the Parthenon. One pediment is located on the east side of the building and another on the west. The sculptures on the east pediment tell the tale of the birth of the goddess Athena, while those on the west depict a battle between Athena and the god Poseidon to determine who would be the patron deity of Athens. The size of the sculptures varied depending on how close they were to the apex (the highest point) of the triangle.  The most impressive pediment sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles come from the east side and illustrate reactions to the birth of Athena.  According to myth, Athena was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Metis. Zeus was afraid that Athena would become more powerful than him so he swallowed Metis whole while she was pregnant. This did not stop the pregnancy and Athena became so big that Zeus’ head was split open with an axe by the Greek blacksmith god Hephaestus, and the goddess was born.  Unfortunately, the sculptures depicting the head-blowing birth have not survived but the sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles do show the reactions of Greek deities to the birth. British Museum curator Ian Jenkins notes in his book "The Parthenon Sculptures" (Harvard University Press, 2007) that Athena was born “at daybreak” and sculptures show “the sun-god Helios and the heads of two of his four horses,” emerging from the floor of the pediment, rising “as if from the sea.”  Also observing the event is a nude image of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry, who is shown reclining and apparently enjoying a cup of wine, as if toasting the birth. To the right are two seated goddesses who, Jenkins says, are probably Demeter and her daughter Persephone, while further to the right is a heavily draped Greek girl, apparently a mortal human, who has taken flight after viewing the event.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule. The United States joined the war on the side of South     Vietnam in 1961, but withdrew combat troops in 1973. In 1975 North Vietnam     succeeded in taking control of South Vietnam.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead.

But for one magical Valentine\'s evening, ice dancing was the only thing that anyone in Britain cared about. Robin Scott-Elliot remembers Torvill and Dean\'s perfect dance in Sarajevo  Tuesday 14 July 2009 23:01 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  The girl was the same height as the wall that enclosed the arena. She held a bouquet in one hand and with the other picked furiously at something stuck on the ice, desperate to ensure the surface was perfect for the two competitors waiting their turn. Out of sight, they watched and a country watched with them, millions upon millions waiting, united in a universal anxiety. Perfection was not to be long delayed.  Satisfied with her precise labours, the girl made for the small gate that led off the ice. Jayne Torvill smiled down at her as she scrambled off, her skates now a clumsy hindrance. Alongside Torvill, Christopher Dean stared ahead, inscrutable, his face a mask of calm, his long slender neck, accentuated by his collarless top, giving him the serene air of a swan on the summer water.  The ice was Dean\'s natural habitat, and, at last, the girl banished contentedly into the depths of the Zetra stadium, he led his partner on to the rink.  The gate was closed behind them and they skated briskly to the centre, the brilliance of the ice and the whitewashed wall blurring the spectators and highlighting Torvill and Dean, each clad in billowing tops of darkening purple, he in black trousers and black skates, she in a short dress, also purple, and white skates. It was the evening of Valentine\'s Day, 1984, and in Sarajevo, the host city of the XIV Winter Olympics, two Britons were on the brink of passing forever into sporting greatness.  "My whole family went round to my granny\'s – we always went there for special events like royal weddings. I remember being very nervous – there was so much expectation. And it was just perfect."  Fran, aged 14 in 1984  Whatever the standing of ice dancing as an Olympic sport – a debate for another time, and it would be far from alone in the dock – the simple truth is that on that night in the former Yugoslavia, Torvill and Dean executed an achievement of immense worth. Sport may become, as the Olympic movement demands, relentlessly faster, higher, stronger, but grace spans ages, through a Bradman drive to a Cruyff turn and on to a Federer forehand. Torvill and Dean, artists on ice, reached the rare ground of sporting perfection. What is more, under an almost intolerable weight of expectation, they captured a nation.  Twenty-four million people watched the BBC (the corporation was so fearful of the host broadcaster cutting away during the routine that they covered it with just their own single hand-held camera), a figure that astonishes almost as much as the string of sixes that was to be strung across the screen once the pair\'s finale had left them laid out on the ice.

"An adult human brain has more than 100 billion neurons"  >\xa0100 billion  One of the most remarkable aspects of the adult nervous system is the human brain. The human brain controls memory, vision, learning, thought, consciousness and other activities. By means of electrochemical impulses the brain directly controls conscious or voluntary behavior. It also monitors, through feedback circuitry, most involuntary behavior and influences automatic activities of the internal organs.  During fetal development the foundations of the mind are laid as billions of neurons form appropriate connections and patterns. No aspect of this complicated structure has been left to chance. The basic wiring plan is encoded in the genes. It has been shown from previous studies that in developing embryos of animals, nerve cells are created in or travel to designated regions of the brain, and once in place send out axons along preprogrammed paths to make contact with specific targets.  The brain\'s billions of neurons connect with one another in complex networks. All physical and mental functioning depends on the establishment and maintenance of neuron networks. A person\'s habits and skills -- such as nail-biting or playing a musical instrument -- become embedded within the brain in frequently activated neuron networks. When a person stops performing an activity, the neural networks for the activity fall into disuse and eventually may disappear.  Differences in weight and size of a person\'s brain does not correlate with differences in mental ability. The adult human brain normally weighs from 1.0 to 1.5\xa0kg (2¼ to 3¼\xa0lbs).  The work of the brain is similar to a combination of a computer and a chemical factory. So take good care of your PC!

Older estimates have long suggested that 100 billion was the magic number, but some more recent research suggests that the brain actually contains fewer neurons than previously believed.  The human brain is made up of a complex network of neurons . These neurons serve as the building blocks of the nervous system, transmitting information to and from the brain and throughout the body.  You probably expect that a large number of neurons are required for such a complex process, but just how many neurons are there in the human brain?  How Many Neurons are in the Human Brain?  According to many estimates, the human brain contains around 100 billion neurons (give or take a few billion). This estimate has often been reported for many years in neuroscience and psychology textbooks and for many years was simply accepted as a relatively close approximation.  Recently, however, Brazilian researcher Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel discovered that these estimates might not be entirely accurate. While the number is widely cited, she found that no one seemed to know where this number originated. She then decided to investigate in order to determine if the number is accurate. | Question: The human brain is made up of between 10 billion and 100 billion nerve cells known as what?', ['nerve cells', 'neuron', 'neurons'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1877'), ("Context: Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city ...Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city | Daily Mail Online  Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city  comments  Prague is one of Europe's architectural gems, with more knockout picture-postcard views than some entire countries.

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa. This quotation comes from the translation in Ibn Battuta in Black Africa by Said Hamdun and Noël | Question: "Which North African food dish made of coarsely ground wheat takes it’s name from the Arabic word Kaskasa meaning ""To Pound"" ?" ?', ['couscous'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2522'), ("Context: Indian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience ( which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature ) and by those leaders ' exposure to Fabian socialism .

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities "by ancient usage" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891.

Trade flourished between China and the Ryukyu kingdom (Okinawa). Many instruments were brought over, including their sanxian, now called the Okinawan Sanshin. It is said to have been brought over by merchants from Fukien in 1392, a time when there was considerable immigration from southern China.  The Sanxian  Now we come to it’s arrival to Japan. It’s generally said that the sanshin came to Japan in 1562, in the city of Sakai (a port city south of Osaka). It’s assumed to have come from Okinawa, though with all the trade that was happening with China, direct importation was by no means out of the question. There probably were Chinese sanxian in Japan before 1562, but not in significant enough numbers to start anything. The Okinawan sanshin is what caused the shamisen to be taken up by the Japanese.  Soon after, biwa players took up the sanshin (now called the shamisen) so they could be better heard on the street. And being the first players of the instrument in Japan, they could do what they wanted with it! And do they did.  Kusakabe Kimbei - Geshia Playing Shamisen  The shamisen is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the shamisen is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the dō , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The sao, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.  The three strings are traditionally made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or ‘tetron’ strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.  Shamisen maker with a customer  The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as nagauta, or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and bunraku. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.  The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is gidayū, named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the bunraku puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The gidayū shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. From the 19th century female performers known as onna-jōruri or onna gidayū also carried on this concert tradition.

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

The shamisen had many forms before it arrived to Japan, though it’s unclear where it originated from. It is said that a three stringed lute arrived in China during the later years of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). This instrument is called the sanxian. Trade flourished between China and the Ryukyu kingdom (Okinawa). Many instruments were brought over, including their sanxian, now called the Okinawan Sanshin. It is said to have been brought over by merchants from Fukien in 1392, a time when there was considerable immigration from southern China.  The Sanxian  Now we come to it’s arrival to Japan. It’s generally said that the sanshin came to Japan in 1562, in the city of Sakai (a port city south of Osaka). It’s assumed to have come from Okinawa, though with all the trade that was happening with China, direct importation was by no means out of the question. There probably were Chinese sanxian in Japan before 1562, but not in significant enough numbers to start anything. The Okinawan sanshin is what caused the shamisen to be taken up by the Japanese.  Soon after, biwa players took up the sanshin (now called the shamisen) so they could be better heard on the street. And being the first players of the instrument in Japan, they could do what they wanted with it! And do they did.  Kusakabe Kimbei - Geshia Playing Shamisen  The shamisen is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the shamisen is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the dō , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The sao, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.  The three strings are traditionally made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or ‘tetron’ strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.  Shamisen maker with a customer  The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as nagauta, or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and bunraku. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.  The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is gidayū, named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the bunraku puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The gidayū shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. From the 19th century female performers known as onna-jōruri or onna gidayū also carried on this concert tradition.

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai).

It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Fresh off of their independence war decades earlier, the US Navy found itself with nary a capable vessel of defending her merchant force and her interests from French aggression and pirate attacks. The resulting design initially encompassed some six ships of great gun strength but this was eventually curtailed to the USS United States, USS Constellation and the USS Constitution.  At her core, the USS Constitution was a traditional-looking three-masted great ship of oak wood hull construction and protected by copper sheathing throughout. She carried 32 x 24-pdr (pounder) long guns - supplemented by 20 x 32-pdr carronades and 2 x 24-pdr bow chasers making her a 44-gun heavy frigate. The crew complement was 450 personnel though today the vessel is supported by only 55 personnel in a primarily ceremonial role. She was partially launched on the 20th of September in 1797 where her weight prevented the official launching from completing. As a result, the reworked Constitution was once again ceremoniously launched on October 21st, 1797 in Boston Harbor.  The following year, the USS Constitution was actively patrolling the waters off of the southeast portion of the United States. During this time - the time of the Quasi-War with France, a conflict never formally declared and surprisingly fought entirely at sea - she saw action in support of marine units and was deserving of distinction in the conflict. By 1803, the vessel was serving in the Mediterranean Sea and fought along the North African coast to combat African nations seeking a sort of tax for American use of local Mediterranean trade ways. As the troubles in the Mediterranean subsided, a brewing conflict with the British was underway. The USS Constitution faced off with the HMS Guerriere in 1812 to which the Constitution earned her "Old Ironsides" nickname when British cannon rounds seemingly bounced off the American vessel\'s hull. After several more years of storied engagements and more years undergoing repairs for damaged received in those engagements, the Constitution was placed through major reconstruction which was completed by 1835 at the request of the United States Congress.  The Constitution was back in action in the American Civil War though she was not used in anger and merely moved to a safe location so as to protect her from Southern assault. The ironclad "New Ironsides" instead fought on in her name. With the close of the war and the arrivial of steam-powered vessels, wind-powered ships like the USS Constitution were less and less in need and would spend her days as a training ship for the Naval Academy at Annapolis. Following a world tour, the ship would be in dock once more for refitting and repair. She would later take part in her 200th celebration on July 21, 1997. The voyage of the Constitution would eventually find her in a home in Charleston Navy Yard.  Though a "show boat" in many regards, the USS Constitution is actually crewed by active sailors and commanders where it is regarded as an honor to serve on and underneath her decks for any chosen man. The vessel was first ordered in 1794, laid down that same year and launched in 1797. Acting US President George Washington is credited with naming the vessel after the United States Constitution. The Constitution completed a round-the-world voyage in March of 1844, taking some 30 months to accomplish the feat. In a bit of interesting trivia, she remains the only known vessel afloat to have sunk an enemy ship with true cannon fire.\xa0©www.MilitaryFactory.com  \xa0\xa0Global Operators\xa0\xa0  USS Constitution - pediaview.comUSS Constitution  USS Constitution  Constitution, dressed overall , fires a 17-gun salute in Boston Harbor, 4 July 2014.

Approximately 9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo,  the capital city of Japan, which is the sixth largest city proper in the OECD and the fourth leading global city in the world.  The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world\'s largest metropolitan area with over 35 million residents and the world\'s largest urban agglomeration economy.  Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan\'s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.  Japan is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power.    The country has the world\'s third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world\'s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world\'s fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world\'s eighth largest military budget,  used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population enjoys the highest life expectancy, the third lowest infant mortality in the world,    and ranked first in the number of Nobel laureates of any country in Asia.

Today, Church leaders oversee Church operations in some 160 countries from this location. However, leadership is heavily decentralized throughout the world, with local, regional and national levels of administration operating mainly through a lay clergy.  Temple Square is Utah’s number one tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors a year. Temple Square consists of the Salt Lake Temple, the Tabernacle (home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir), the Assembly Hall and two visitors’ centers.  To the east of Temple Square is a plaza where the Church Office Building, Church Administration Building, Joseph Smith Memorial Building and Relief Society Building are located. All of these buildings are used for offices for Church departments and general leadership.  West of Temple Square is the Family History Library — the world’s largest genealogical facility — and the Museum of Church History and Art.  North of Temple Square sits the Conference Center — a 21,000-seat auditorium, one of the largest in the world. It is used for semiannual meetings broadcast worldwide for the entire Church membership, as well as frequent closed-circuit conferences broadcast to specific groups of members in different parts of the world.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously.

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens. They used the ingredients that were most | Question: The stomach of which animal is traditionally stuffed for a haggis?', ['sheep'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1015'), ('Context: Spike (TV network)Spike (formerly and popularly known as Spike TV) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Viacom Music and Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal\'s USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s.

Fresh off of their independence war decades earlier, the US Navy found itself with nary a capable vessel of defending her merchant force and her interests from French aggression and pirate attacks. The resulting design initially encompassed some six ships of great gun strength but this was eventually curtailed to the USS United States, USS Constellation and the USS Constitution.  At her core, the USS Constitution was a traditional-looking three-masted great ship of oak wood hull construction and protected by copper sheathing throughout. She carried 32 x 24-pdr (pounder) long guns - supplemented by 20 x 32-pdr carronades and 2 x 24-pdr bow chasers making her a 44-gun heavy frigate. The crew complement was 450 personnel though today the vessel is supported by only 55 personnel in a primarily ceremonial role. She was partially launched on the 20th of September in 1797 where her weight prevented the official launching from completing. As a result, the reworked Constitution was once again ceremoniously launched on October 21st, 1797 in Boston Harbor.  The following year, the USS Constitution was actively patrolling the waters off of the southeast portion of the United States. During this time - the time of the Quasi-War with France, a conflict never formally declared and surprisingly fought entirely at sea - she saw action in support of marine units and was deserving of distinction in the conflict. By 1803, the vessel was serving in the Mediterranean Sea and fought along the North African coast to combat African nations seeking a sort of tax for American use of local Mediterranean trade ways. As the troubles in the Mediterranean subsided, a brewing conflict with the British was underway. The USS Constitution faced off with the HMS Guerriere in 1812 to which the Constitution earned her "Old Ironsides" nickname when British cannon rounds seemingly bounced off the American vessel\'s hull. After several more years of storied engagements and more years undergoing repairs for damaged received in those engagements, the Constitution was placed through major reconstruction which was completed by 1835 at the request of the United States Congress.  The Constitution was back in action in the American Civil War though she was not used in anger and merely moved to a safe location so as to protect her from Southern assault. The ironclad "New Ironsides" instead fought on in her name. With the close of the war and the arrivial of steam-powered vessels, wind-powered ships like the USS Constitution were less and less in need and would spend her days as a training ship for the Naval Academy at Annapolis. Following a world tour, the ship would be in dock once more for refitting and repair. She would later take part in her 200th celebration on July 21, 1997. The voyage of the Constitution would eventually find her in a home in Charleston Navy Yard.  Though a "show boat" in many regards, the USS Constitution is actually crewed by active sailors and commanders where it is regarded as an honor to serve on and underneath her decks for any chosen man. The vessel was first ordered in 1794, laid down that same year and launched in 1797. Acting US President George Washington is credited with naming the vessel after the United States Constitution. The Constitution completed a round-the-world voyage in March of 1844, taking some 30 months to accomplish the feat. In a bit of interesting trivia, she remains the only known vessel afloat to have sunk an enemy ship with true cannon fire.\xa0©www.MilitaryFactory.com  \xa0\xa0Global Operators\xa0\xa0  USS Constitution - pediaview.comUSS Constitution  USS Constitution  Constitution, dressed overall , fires a 17-gun salute in Boston Harbor, 4 July 2014.

Out of loneliness , he has adopted various sports balls as `` buddies '' and drawn faces on them . He has painted `` Alive in Tucson '' on billboards and highway signs during his trip , hoping others might see the message . Phil is married to Carol and they have twin girls together .

In season 3 , Melissa kills Darrell , one of paranoiac Pat Brown 's crew , and consequently starts acting strangely , ultimately forcing Todd to lock her in a focus - group room to stop her from jumping off a building .

Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, China, Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The kanji that make up Japan\'s name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun".  Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan\'s land area. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions. The population of 126\xa0million is the world\'s tenth largest. Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan\'s total population. Approximately 9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo,  the capital city of Japan, which is the sixth largest city proper in the OECD and the fourth leading global city in the world.  The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world\'s largest metropolitan area with over 35 million residents and the world\'s largest urban agglomeration economy.  Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan\'s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.  Japan is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power.    The country has the world\'s third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world\'s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world\'s fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world\'s eighth largest military budget,  used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population enjoys the highest life expectancy, the third lowest infant mortality in the world,    and ranked first in the number of Nobel laureates of any country in Asia.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously.

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens. They used the ingredients that were most | Question: The stomach of which animal is traditionally stuffed for a haggis?', ['sheep'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1015'), ('Context: Spike (TV network)Spike (formerly and popularly known as Spike TV) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Viacom Music and Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal\'s USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s.

The first paperback copy appeared in 1948, published by the British Publishers Guild.  Background  All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer\'s native Swansea in South Wales. Written over a number of years, the often comic stories show glimpses of his life, from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post.  Thomas claimed, in a letter to Vernon Watkins, that he had "kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons". He claimed also, somewhat dubiously, that the title was not a parody of James Joyce\'s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, although the general influence of Joyce\'s Dubliners was freely acknowledged. In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins: "I\'ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas."  Reception  Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well. Ferris, reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said: "the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more". Critic Jacob Korg later commented that "taken as a group, [the stories] seem to trace the child\'s emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering, pathos, and dignity".  The book has been described as showing Thomas\' "waggish humor at its best, his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display".  Apart from Under Milk Wood, the book is "probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts". It has been suggested that few writers "have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious".   Adaptations  The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas\' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014.   Contents  * "The Peaches"  * "A Visit to Grandpa\'s"  * "Patricia, Edith and Arnold"  * "The Fight"  * "Extraordinary Little Cough"  * "Just Like Little Dogs"  * "Where Tawe Flows"  * "Who Do You Wish Was with Us?"  * "Old Garbo"  * "One Warm Saturday"  Under Milk WoodUnder Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("bugger all" backwards).  They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.  Origins and development  When Thomas was staying at New Quay, Cardiganshire, in West Wales, one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for BBC Wales on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva. This step was taken to avoid development of resistance and compromise the | Question: Artemisinin and derivatives are drugs found to act especially well on which disease?', ['falciparum malaria', 'malaria'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3595'), ('Context: BagelA bagel ( \'; ), also spelled beigel,  is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: The Dutch regained the colony briefly in 1673 , then finally lost it permanently to the English in 1674 after the Third Anglo - Dutch War . | Question: when was new york taken by the british ?', ['1674'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-86440'), ("Context: The Valle de los Caídos ( Spanish pronunciation : ( ˈbaʎe ðe los kaˈiðos ) , `` Valley of the Fallen '' ) is a Catholic basilica and a monumental memorial in the municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial , erected at Cuelgamuros Valley in the Sierra de Guadarrama , near Madrid , conceived by Spanish dictator Francisco Franco to honour and bury those who died in the Spanish Civil War .

Achilles was a famous Greek warrior whose mother was one of the immortals, but he was not. His mother sought to protect her son by dipping him in the River Styx, which was believed to have magical powers. She held her infant son by his heel. Consequently, the only part of his body that was vulnerable was his heel. As fate would have it, at the battle of Troy, an enemy warrior, Paris, shot an arrow into Achilles heel and killed him. The phrase “Achilles heel” has come into common usage to describe someone’s personal weakness or vulnerability.\xa0  AchillesIn Greek mythology, Achilles (; , Akhilleus,) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer\'s Iliad. His mother was the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons.  Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term Achilles\' heel has come to mean a person\'s point of weakness.  Etymology   Achilles\' name can be analyzed as a combination of  (\') "grief" and  (\') "a people, tribe, nation." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles\' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of  \' ("glory", usually glory in war).  Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy,  following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.  R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name.   The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.  It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".  Birth   Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.   There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in Argonautica (iv.760) Zeus\' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it. After Bond kills Tee Hee, he rescues her out of the bed and they soon make out.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

The shamisen had many forms before it arrived to Japan, though it’s unclear where it originated from. It is said that a three stringed lute arrived in China during the later years of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). This instrument is called the sanxian. Trade flourished between China and the Ryukyu kingdom (Okinawa). Many instruments were brought over, including their sanxian, now called the Okinawan Sanshin. It is said to have been brought over by merchants from Fukien in 1392, a time when there was considerable immigration from southern China.  The Sanxian  Now we come to it’s arrival to Japan. It’s generally said that the sanshin came to Japan in 1562, in the city of Sakai (a port city south of Osaka). It’s assumed to have come from Okinawa, though with all the trade that was happening with China, direct importation was by no means out of the question. There probably were Chinese sanxian in Japan before 1562, but not in significant enough numbers to start anything. The Okinawan sanshin is what caused the shamisen to be taken up by the Japanese.  Soon after, biwa players took up the sanshin (now called the shamisen) so they could be better heard on the street. And being the first players of the instrument in Japan, they could do what they wanted with it! And do they did.  Kusakabe Kimbei - Geshia Playing Shamisen  The shamisen is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the shamisen is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the dō , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The sao, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.  The three strings are traditionally made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or ‘tetron’ strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.  Shamisen maker with a customer  The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as nagauta, or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and bunraku. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.  The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is gidayū, named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the bunraku puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The gidayū shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. From the 19th century female performers known as onna-jōruri or onna gidayū also carried on this concert tradition.

In 1997, Tony Blair won the biggest Labour victory in history to sweep the party to power and end 18 years of Conservative government. He has been one of the most dynamic leaders of modern times; few British prime ministers have shaped the nation’s course as profoundly as Tony Blair did, during his ten years in power. His achievements and his legacy will be debated for years to come. His memoirs reveal in intimate detail this unique political and personal journey and provide an insight into the man, the politician and the statesman, charting successes, controversies and disappointments with an extraordinary candour. They will prove essential and compulsive reading for anyone who wants to understand the complexities of our global world.  “Tony Blair’s The Journey will break new ground in prime ministerial memoirs just as Blair himself broke the mould of British politics,” said Rebuck.\xa0 “His book is frank, open, revealing and written in an intimate and accessible style.\xa0 As an account of the nature and uses of power, it will have a readership that extends well beyond politics, to all those who want to understand the challenge of leadership in today’s world.”  Tony\xa0Blair says: “I have really enjoyed the writing of the book. I have tried to write a book which describes the human as much as the political dimensions of life as Prime Minister. Though necessarily retrospective, it is an attempt to inform and shape current and future thinking as much as an historical account of the past. Most of all I want readers to have as much pleasure reading it as I had writing it.”  “Tony Blair is an extremely popular figure in North America,” said Sonny Mehta, his US publisher. “His memoir is refreshing, both for its candour and vivid portrayal of political life.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

The first paperback copy appeared in 1948, published by the British Publishers Guild.  Background  All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer\'s native Swansea in South Wales. Written over a number of years, the often comic stories show glimpses of his life, from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post.  Thomas claimed, in a letter to Vernon Watkins, that he had "kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons". He claimed also, somewhat dubiously, that the title was not a parody of James Joyce\'s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, although the general influence of Joyce\'s Dubliners was freely acknowledged. In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins: "I\'ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas."  Reception  Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well. Ferris, reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said: "the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more". Critic Jacob Korg later commented that "taken as a group, [the stories] seem to trace the child\'s emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering, pathos, and dignity".  The book has been described as showing Thomas\' "waggish humor at its best, his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display".  Apart from Under Milk Wood, the book is "probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts". It has been suggested that few writers "have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious".   Adaptations  The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas\' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014.   Contents  * "The Peaches"  * "A Visit to Grandpa\'s"  * "Patricia, Edith and Arnold"  * "The Fight"  * "Extraordinary Little Cough"  * "Just Like Little Dogs"  * "Where Tawe Flows"  * "Who Do You Wish Was with Us?"  * "Old Garbo"  * "One Warm Saturday"  Under Milk WoodUnder Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("bugger all" backwards).  They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.  Origins and development  When Thomas was staying at New Quay, Cardiganshire, in West Wales, one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for BBC Wales on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva. This step was taken to avoid development of resistance and compromise the | Question: Artemisinin and derivatives are drugs found to act especially well on which disease?', ['falciparum malaria', 'malaria'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3595'), ('Context: BagelA bagel ( \'; ), also spelled beigel,  is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: The Dutch regained the colony briefly in 1673 , then finally lost it permanently to the English in 1674 after the Third Anglo - Dutch War . | Question: when was new york taken by the british ?', ['1674'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-86440'), ("Context: The Valle de los Caídos ( Spanish pronunciation : ( ˈbaʎe ðe los kaˈiðos ) , `` Valley of the Fallen '' ) is a Catholic basilica and a monumental memorial in the municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial , erected at Cuelgamuros Valley in the Sierra de Guadarrama , near Madrid , conceived by Spanish dictator Francisco Franco to honour and bury those who died in the Spanish Civil War .

Temple Square consists of the Salt Lake Temple, the Tabernacle (home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir), the Assembly Hall and two visitors’ centers.  To the east of Temple Square is a plaza where the Church Office Building, Church Administration Building, Joseph Smith Memorial Building and Relief Society Building are located. All of these buildings are used for offices for Church departments and general leadership.  West of Temple Square is the Family History Library — the world’s largest genealogical facility — and the Museum of Church History and Art.  North of Temple Square sits the Conference Center — a 21,000-seat auditorium, one of the largest in the world. It is used for semiannual meetings broadcast worldwide for the entire Church membership, as well as frequent closed-circuit conferences broadcast to specific groups of members in different parts of the world. It is also a popular venue for concerts and performances.\xa0  Mormon-Church Offices | Utah.comMormon-Church Offices |                                 Utah.com  SEE LOCATION ON THE MAP  The tallest building in Salt Lake City at 28 stories, the Church Office Building at Temple Square houses the administrative support staff for the lay ministry of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout the world.

Achilles was a famous Greek warrior whose mother was one of the immortals, but he was not. His mother sought to protect her son by dipping him in the River Styx, which was believed to have magical powers. She held her infant son by his heel. Consequently, the only part of his body that was vulnerable was his heel. As fate would have it, at the battle of Troy, an enemy warrior, Paris, shot an arrow into Achilles heel and killed him. The phrase “Achilles heel” has come into common usage to describe someone’s personal weakness or vulnerability.\xa0  AchillesIn Greek mythology, Achilles (; , Akhilleus,) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer\'s Iliad. His mother was the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons.  Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term Achilles\' heel has come to mean a person\'s point of weakness.  Etymology   Achilles\' name can be analyzed as a combination of  (\') "grief" and  (\') "a people, tribe, nation." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles\' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of  \' ("glory", usually glory in war).  Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy,  following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.  R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name.   The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.  It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".  Birth   Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.   There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in Argonautica (iv.760) Zeus\' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

The shamisen had many forms before it arrived to Japan, though it’s unclear where it originated from. It is said that a three stringed lute arrived in China during the later years of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). This instrument is called the sanxian. Trade flourished between China and the Ryukyu kingdom (Okinawa). Many instruments were brought over, including their sanxian, now called the Okinawan Sanshin. It is said to have been brought over by merchants from Fukien in 1392, a time when there was considerable immigration from southern China.  The Sanxian  Now we come to it’s arrival to Japan. It’s generally said that the sanshin came to Japan in 1562, in the city of Sakai (a port city south of Osaka). It’s assumed to have come from Okinawa, though with all the trade that was happening with China, direct importation was by no means out of the question. There probably were Chinese sanxian in Japan before 1562, but not in significant enough numbers to start anything. The Okinawan sanshin is what caused the shamisen to be taken up by the Japanese.  Soon after, biwa players took up the sanshin (now called the shamisen) so they could be better heard on the street. And being the first players of the instrument in Japan, they could do what they wanted with it! And do they did.  Kusakabe Kimbei - Geshia Playing Shamisen  The shamisen is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the shamisen is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the dō , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The sao, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.  The three strings are traditionally made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or ‘tetron’ strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.  Shamisen maker with a customer  The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as nagauta, or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and bunraku. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.  The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is gidayū, named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the bunraku puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The gidayū shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. From the 19th century female performers known as onna-jōruri or onna gidayū also carried on this concert tradition.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

One of those men would be hailed as the inventor of the Frisbee. The other would die unknown, just as he began to fight for a share of the credit and millions in royalties the Frisbee generated. The First to Fly Walter Frederick Morrison came to Warren Franscioni in 1947, looking for work. Both men had been Army Air Corps pilots in World War II. Maj. Franscioni served with the Air Transport Service in India and China; Lt. Morrison flew a fighter in 58 missions over Italy before being shot down and held in Stalag 13, Germany\'s infamous prison camp. Franscioni\'s parents lived in Paso Robles, where his father had been mayor, so he settled after the war in San Luis Obispo. He founded a butane company as his father had done in Paso. He built a home on Conejo Avenue, in a neighborhood developing near San Luis High School, and he opened the Franscioni and Davis Butane Co. office at 884 Broad St., across Broad from Mission College Prep. "I first met Fred Morrison in late 1947," Franscioni wrote in a 1973 letter. "He was a struggling World War II veteran trying to build a home for his family at Baywood Park, a developing residential area just outside San Luis Obispo, California. "At that time, I was attempting to establish a bottle gas business with a partner, George Davis, in San Luis Obispo. We needed someone to assist in the installation of home heating appliances, and Fred went to work for us." The bottled gas business moved too slowly in postwar SLO to sustain three men and their families. So Franscioni and Morrison dreamed up an enterprise on the side. For decades kids had played catch with metal pie tins. The sport grew in popularity during the Depression, and soldiers spread it across the country during the war. The game had a few drawbacks. The tins made a shrill noise, and if you didn\'t catch them just right, they stung. After a few crash landings they could crack or develop sharp edges that cut fingers. Morrison and Franscioni thought of casting them in plastic, a material proliferated by wartime industry. Morrison took credit for the idea in later interviews, but Franscioni said they thought of it together. "I do know that when we compared some of our past experiences at sailing things, it came out plastics," Franscioni wrote.   It seems like a simple idea today, but Morrison and Franscioni broke new ground. And after 49 years of improvements, the Frisbee has diverged little from their first plastic interpretation of a pie tin. "People were throwing paint can lids and paper plates and pie pans throughout history, since they were invented," said Victor Malafronte, a Frisbee historian in Alameda. "The first plastic disc was that Flyin\' Saucer in 1948." Morrison and Franscioni used a lathe to carve their first model out of Tenite, a hard cellulose material now used in toothbrush handles and eyeglass frames. That disc confirmed the aerodynamics of the toy, but it shattered on landing.

This is a video from AnswersinGenesis correcting a lot of the common misconceptions about the famous Scopes Monkey Trial.  Check out GreenSlugg.com for more Creation vs. Evolution information.  Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

The River Wyre meanders across the Fylde from Garstang on the eastern edge, westwards towards Poulton and then northwards to the sea at Fleetwood. The area north and east of the tidal Wyre, known as Over Wyre, is the more rural side of the river. The Fylde peninsula is roughly trisected by the M55 motorway and the A586 road.  The Borough of Fylde is a local government area covering the south of the Fylde plain. The rest is covered by the boroughs of Wyre and Blackpool respectively. The local justice area covering all of the Fylde is called Fylde Coast.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

Question: What Is the Most Abundant Element?  Answer: The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen, which makes up about 3/4 of all matter! Helium makes up most of the remaining 25%. Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe. All of the other elements are relatively rare.  The chemical composition of the earth is quite a bit different from that of the universe. The most abundant element in the earth's crust is oxygen, making up 46.6% of the earth's mass. Silicon is the second most abundant element (27.7%), followed by aluminum (8.1%), iron (5.0%), calcium (3.6%), sodium (2.8%), potassium (2.6%). and magnesium (2.1%). These eight elements account for approximately 98.5% of the total mass of the earth's crust. Of course, the earth's crust is only the outer portion of the earth.

The most abundant element in the human body is oxygen, making up about 65% of the weight of each person.  continue reading below our video  10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know  Carbon is the second more abundant element, making up 18% of the body. Although you have more hydrogen atoms than any other type of element, the mass of a hydrogen atom is so much less than that of the other elements that its abundance comes in third, at 10% by mass.

By Kylene Arnold  Ryan McVay/Photodisc/Getty Images  Of the 92 naturally occurring elements, the Earth's geosphere -- the solid part of the Earth made up of the core, the mantle and the crust -- is primarily composed of only four. These four are iron, oxygen, silicon and magnesium. These elements make up more than 90 percent of the Earth's mass.  Iron  The vast majority of the Earth's supply of iron is found in the core and the mantle. The solid inner core is almost entirely composed of iron, while the liquid outer core is an alloy of iron and nickel, with small amounts of lighter elements. The mantle is composed of iron-magnesium silicates, and the crust is composed of roughly 5 percent iron. All together, iron makes up an estimated 35 percent of the Earth's mass.  Oxygen  Oxygen, the second most abundant element on Earth, is found mainly in the crust. Although oxygen is most often thought of as an atmospheric gas, it is also one of the primary components of the silicate minerals that make up the vast majority of the Earth's crust. Oxygen itself makes up approximately 46.6 percent of the crust and 30 percent of the mass of the entire Earth.  Silicon  Silicon is found in compounds in both the mantle and the crust, making it the third most abundant element. In the mantle, it combines with iron and magnesium and, in the crust, with oxygen in the form of silicate minerals. These minerals make up common compounds such as quartz, mica and talc, as well as rare stones such as emeralds and opals. All together, silicon accounts for approximately 15 percent of the Earth's mass.  Magnesium  Since the majority of the Earth's volume is taken up by its liquid mantle, it makes sense that magnesium, one of the mantle's key components, is the fourth most abundant element on | Question: What is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, representing approximately a quarter of its mass?", ['silicon'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2130'), ("Context: The Paris Sisters recorded a version of `` It 's my Party '' which was slower than Gore 's version .

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

One of those men would be hailed as the inventor of the Frisbee. The other would die unknown, just as he began to fight for a share of the credit and millions in royalties the Frisbee generated. The First to Fly Walter Frederick Morrison came to Warren Franscioni in 1947, looking for work. Both men had been Army Air Corps pilots in World War II. Maj. Franscioni served with the Air Transport Service in India and China; Lt. Morrison flew a fighter in 58 missions over Italy before being shot down and held in Stalag 13, Germany\'s infamous prison camp. Franscioni\'s parents lived in Paso Robles, where his father had been mayor, so he settled after the war in San Luis Obispo. He founded a butane company as his father had done in Paso. He built a home on Conejo Avenue, in a neighborhood developing near San Luis High School, and he opened the Franscioni and Davis Butane Co. office at 884 Broad St., across Broad from Mission College Prep. "I first met Fred Morrison in late 1947," Franscioni wrote in a 1973 letter. "He was a struggling World War II veteran trying to build a home for his family at Baywood Park, a developing residential area just outside San Luis Obispo, California. "At that time, I was attempting to establish a bottle gas business with a partner, George Davis, in San Luis Obispo. We needed someone to assist in the installation of home heating appliances, and Fred went to work for us." The bottled gas business moved too slowly in postwar SLO to sustain three men and their families. So Franscioni and Morrison dreamed up an enterprise on the side. For decades kids had played catch with metal pie tins. The sport grew in popularity during the Depression, and soldiers spread it across the country during the war. The game had a few drawbacks. The tins made a shrill noise, and if you didn\'t catch them just right, they stung. After a few crash landings they could crack or develop sharp edges that cut fingers. Morrison and Franscioni thought of casting them in plastic, a material proliferated by wartime industry. Morrison took credit for the idea in later interviews, but Franscioni said they thought of it together. "I do know that when we compared some of our past experiences at sailing things, it came out plastics," Franscioni wrote.   It seems like a simple idea today, but Morrison and Franscioni broke new ground. And after 49 years of improvements, the Frisbee has diverged little from their first plastic interpretation of a pie tin. "People were throwing paint can lids and paper plates and pie pans throughout history, since they were invented," said Victor Malafronte, a Frisbee historian in Alameda. "The first plastic disc was that Flyin\' Saucer in 1948." Morrison and Franscioni used a lathe to carve their first model out of Tenite, a hard cellulose material now used in toothbrush handles and eyeglass frames. That disc confirmed the aerodynamics of the toy, but it shattered on landing.

This is a video from AnswersinGenesis correcting a lot of the common misconceptions about the famous Scopes Monkey Trial.  Check out GreenSlugg.com for more Creation vs. Evolution information.  Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

The Fylde Coast is a coastal plain in western Lancashire. It is roughly a 13-mile (20-kilometre)square-shaped peninsula, bounded by Morecambe Bay to the north, the Ribble estuary to the south, the Irish Sea to the west, and the Bowland hills to the east. The eastern boundary is approximately the location of the M6 motorway.  It is a flat, alluvial plain, parts were once dug for peat, and it is the western part of an area formerly known as\xa0Amounderness. The name \'Fylde\' is of Scandinavian origin, meaning "field".  The west coast is almost entirely urban, consisting of the towns of Fleetwood, Cleveleys, Blackpool and Lytham St Annes, with the villages of Wrea Green, Poulton-le-Fylde and Kirkham not far inland.  The River Wyre meanders across the Fylde from Garstang on the eastern edge, westwards towards Poulton and then northwards to the sea at Fleetwood. The area north and east of the tidal Wyre, known as Over Wyre, is the more rural side of the river. The Fylde peninsula is roughly trisected by the M55 motorway and the A586 road.  The Borough of Fylde is a local government area covering the south of the Fylde plain. The rest is covered by the boroughs of Wyre and Blackpool respectively. The local justice area covering all of the Fylde is called Fylde Coast.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

Question: What Is the Most Abundant Element?  Answer: The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen, which makes up about 3/4 of all matter! Helium makes up most of the remaining 25%. Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe. All of the other elements are relatively rare.  The chemical composition of the earth is quite a bit different from that of the universe. The most abundant element in the earth's crust is oxygen, making up 46.6% of the earth's mass. Silicon is the second most abundant element (27.7%), followed by aluminum (8.1%), iron (5.0%), calcium (3.6%), sodium (2.8%), potassium (2.6%). and magnesium (2.1%). These eight elements account for approximately 98.5% of the total mass of the earth's crust. Of course, the earth's crust is only the outer portion of the earth.

By Kylene Arnold  Ryan McVay/Photodisc/Getty Images  Of the 92 naturally occurring elements, the Earth's geosphere -- the solid part of the Earth made up of the core, the mantle and the crust -- is primarily composed of only four. These four are iron, oxygen, silicon and magnesium. These elements make up more than 90 percent of the Earth's mass.  Iron  The vast majority of the Earth's supply of iron is found in the core and the mantle. The solid inner core is almost entirely composed of iron, while the liquid outer core is an alloy of iron and nickel, with small amounts of lighter elements. The mantle is composed of iron-magnesium silicates, and the crust is composed of roughly 5 percent iron. All together, iron makes up an estimated 35 percent of the Earth's mass.  Oxygen  Oxygen, the second most abundant element on Earth, is found mainly in the crust. Although oxygen is most often thought of as an atmospheric gas, it is also one of the primary components of the silicate minerals that make up the vast majority of the Earth's crust. Oxygen itself makes up approximately 46.6 percent of the crust and 30 percent of the mass of the entire Earth.  Silicon  Silicon is found in compounds in both the mantle and the crust, making it the third most abundant element. In the mantle, it combines with iron and magnesium and, in the crust, with oxygen in the form of silicate minerals. These minerals make up common compounds such as quartz, mica and talc, as well as rare stones such as emeralds and opals. All together, silicon accounts for approximately 15 percent of the Earth's mass.  Magnesium  Since the majority of the Earth's volume is taken up by its liquid mantle, it makes sense that magnesium, one of the mantle's key components, is the fourth most abundant element on | Question: What is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, representing approximately a quarter of its mass?", ['silicon'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2130'), ("Context: The Paris Sisters recorded a version of `` It 's my Party '' which was slower than Gore 's version .

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

The creative musical theatre artists who were inspired by this painting drew the other characters in Act One from figures in the painting.

What’s Going On? According to Sondheim and Lapine  The painting’s setting is the island of la Grande Jatte, which is located northwest of Paris in the Seine River. In 1884 (when Seurat began working on his painting), the island was a pastoral place where people could go to get away from city life.

He is most famous for his work on television as Johnny Carson\'s sidekick, announcer, and second banana on The Tonight Show from 1962 through 1992. He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.

A popular idol, he inspired the Romantic mystique of the virtuoso and revolutionized violin technique.  Niccolò Paganini featured on a cigarette trading card.  © Hemera/Thinkstock  After initial study with his father, Paganini studied with a local violinist, G. Servetto, and then with the celebrated Giacomo Costa. He made his first appearance in 1793 and then studied with Alessandro Rolla and Gaspare Ghiretti at Parma . In 1797, accompanied by his father, he toured Lombardy, where with each concert his reputation grew. Gaining his independence soon after, he indulged excessively in gambling and romantic love affairs. At one point he pawned his violin because of gambling debts; a French merchant lent him a Guarneri violin to play a concert and, after hearing him, gave him the instrument.  Between 1801 and 1807 he wrote the 24 Capricci for unaccompanied violin, displaying the novel features of his technique, and the two sets of six sonatas for violin and guitar. He reappeared in Italy as a violinist in 1805 and was appointed director of music at Piombino by Napoleon ’s sister, Élisa Bonaparte Baciocchi . He later gave recitals of his own compositions in many towns in Italy and about 1824 formed his long attachment with the singer Antonia Bianchi.  In 1828 Paganini experienced great success in Vienna, and his appearances in Paris and London in 1831 were equally sensational. His tour of England and Scotland in 1832 made him a wealthy man. In 1833 he settled in Paris, where he commissioned Hector Berlioz to write his symphony Harold en Italie . Paganini thought that the challenge of its viola solo was too slight, however, and he never played it. Following the failure of the Casino Paganini, a gambling house in which he had invested, he went to Marseille in 1839, then to Nice.  Paganini, etching by Luigi Calamatta after a drawing by J.-A.-D.

Stories circulated that he was in league with the devil and that he had been imprisoned for murder; his burial in consecrated ground was delayed for five years. He was long regarded as a miser, but a more accurate portrait would consider his desire to be free from a train of dependent followers and their importunities for his largesse. His gift of 20,000 francs to the struggling composer Berlioz was an act of generosity seemingly uncharacteristic; possibly Paganini, recognizing in “ Beethoven ’s successor” a worthy talent, thought it was his duty to come to the composer’s aid.

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.  Links  The Chisholm Trail - Kansas Historical SocietyThe Chisholm Trail         - Kansas Historical Society  February 1936 (Vol. 5, No. 1), pages 3 to 14  Transcribed by Elizabeth Lawrence; digitized with permission of  the Kansas Historical Society.  NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R.

The Laughing Kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) is a carnivorous bird in the kingfisher subfamily Halcyoninae. Native to eastern mainland Australia, it has also been introduced to parts of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Western Australia. Male and female adults are similar in plumage, which is predominantly brown and white. A common and familiar bird, this species of kookaburra is well known for its laughing call. The species was previously known as the Laughing Jackass and Giant Kingfisher. They live in close family groups where the young male offspring are driven out near maturity and the females usually stay on and assist the breeding adults in raising the new young by defending and feeding.

Additional information added by Avianweb  The Laughing Kookaburras (Dacelo novaeguineae) are Australian kingfishers that were named for their laughing calls.  In the past, it has been given the nicknames, the “Laughing Jackass” and the “Giant Kingfisher.” Its name comes from the Aboriginal language of the extinct Wiradhuri tribe.  Kookaburras occupy open woodland territories, forests and land on the edges of plains. It is the largest member of the Kingfisher family.  \xa0  Distribution and Habitat  The Laughing Kookaburras are indigenous to the woodlands of Eastern\xa0 mainland Australia , but they have also been introduced to Western Australia, Tasmania ,\xa0Flinders Island, Kangaroo Island , and New Zealand .  The Laughing Kookaburra prefers the mature trees in the woodlands, especially in the dry eucalyptus forests; however, it is a frequent guest in urban parks and gardens. Its territory is based on the availability of a consistent food supply and safe nesting sites.  Kookaburras can live 10 to 12 years in the wild, and they are not threatened or\xa0endangered.\xa0They remain in their territories year-round.  \xa0  Description  A familiar bird in its habitats, the Laughing Kookaburra is easily identifiable by its plumage, mainly shades of brown and white. This makes for excellent camouflage to protect it from its predators and hide it from its prey. Its head and bill are both large, and its eyes are brown. Its stocky, solidly built body is about 45 cm (18 in) long, from beak to tail, making it one of the most sizeable species in the Kingfisher family. The boat-shaped bill is bi-colored; the maxilla, or top part, is blue, and the lower part, or mandible, is a pale pink.  The sexes are dimorphic yet very similar. The female is larger than the male, and her rump contains fewer blue markings than the male’s. The body is cream-colored, and there is a dark brown stripe running through each eye and across the top of the beige-colored head. Another brown stripe runs from the eye to the back of the head on the side. Both the back and the wings are brown, although the wings include sparkling sky-blue markings on the shoulders. The tail is rufous reddish-orange with dark brown bars and white tips on the feathers.  The Laughing Kookaburra’s breast is filled with pale gray, wavy lines, and the outsides of the wings are covered with a scattering of blue markings. The male Laughing Kookaburra’s rump is often blue. The female is slightly larger than the male.  \xa0  Vocalizations  The name "Laughing Kookaburra | Question: "In Australia, what is known as a ""Laughing Jackass""?" ?', ['kookaburra', 'dacelo'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3486'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , the Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .

Question: What Is the Most Abundant Gas in the Earth\'s Atmosphere?  The Earth\'s atmosphere or air is composed of several gases. One gas is much more abundant than any other. Can you guess which one it is?  Answer:\xa0By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth\'s atmosphere is nitrogen , which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20-21%. Although humid air seems like it contains a lot of water, the maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is only about 4%.  Abundance of Gases in the Atmosphere  This table lists the eleven most abundant gases in the lower portion of Earth\'s atmosphere (up to 25 km). While the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen are fairly stable, the amount of greenhouse gases changes and depends on location. Water vapor is extremely variable. In arid or extremely cold regions, water vapor may be nearly absent. In warm, tropical regions, water vapor accounts for a significant portion of atmospheric gases.  continue reading below our video  Test Your General Science Knowledge  Some references include other gases on this list, such as krypton (less abundant than helium, but more than hydrogen), xenon (less abundant than hydrogen), nitrogen dioxide (less abundant than ozone), and iodine (less abundant than ozone).  Gas  * gases with variable composition  Reference:\xa0Pidwirny, M. (2006). "Atmospheric Composition".\xa0Fundamentals of Physical Geography, 2nd Edition.  The average concentration of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxde, methane, and nitrous dioxide has been increasing. Ozone is concentrated around cities and in the Earth\'s stratosphere. In addition to the elements in the table and krypton, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, and iodine (all mentioned earlier), there are trace amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and several other gases.  Why Is Important To Know the Abundance of Gases?  It\'s important to know which gas is most abundant, what the other gases are in the Earth\'s atmosphere, and how the composition of air changes with altitude and over time for multiple reasons. The information helps us understand and predict the weather. The amount of water vapor in air is particularly relevant to weather forecasting. The gas composition helps us understand the effects of natural and manmade chemicals released into the atmosphere. The make-up of the atmosphere is extremely important for climate, so changes in gases may help us predict broad climate change.

By Patricia Arnett  Ablestock.com/AbleStock.com/Getty Images  The atmosphere is a mixture of gases that surround the Earth. It is essential to all life and serves several purposes, such as providing air for respiration, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting the earth from falling meteorites, controlling climate and regulating the water cycle. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of approximately 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 1 percent argon and trace amounts of other gases that include carbon dioxide and neon.  Nitrogen  Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images  Nitrogen is a colorless, unscented and inert (does not react with other chemicals) gas. Chemist Daniel Rutherford first discovered this chemical element in 1772. Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere and is found in all living organisms. Nitrogen is an important component of amino acids, protein, DNA and RNA. All living organisms depend on nitrogen for growth, metabolic processes and reproduction.  The atmosphere is the primary source of nitrogen; however, plants and animals are not able to use it directly. Nitrogen enters the soil through precipitation, animal waste and dead organic matter.

She is played by Jennifer Aniston , who received Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe for her performance.  Contents  [ show ]  Early Life  Rachel Karen Green was born to Leonard and Sandra Green , who gave her and her two sisters Jill and Amy , a rather spoiled upbringing. She met Monica Geller for the first time when they were both six years old and they quickly became best friends, remaining exactly that from then until attending the same high school. Rachel also soon met Monica\'s older brother, Ross , who developed a crush on her which he ultimately decided to keep to himself.  She was also involved with an unpleasant-natured fellow high school student named Chip, who arrived late to take her out to the high school prom. When it appeared that Chip was never going to arrive, Ross, after being encouraged by his parents Jack and Judy , decided to ask her out himself, but missed his chance when Chip arrived before he could ask her. She soon learned how unpleasant, careless and unfaithful at his core Chip was when he ditched her at the prom to have sex with another girl named Amy Welsh .  Rachel herself, however, was a bully to an overweight student named Will Colbert , spurring him and his friend, Ross, who dealt with the fact that she never seemed to notice his feelings for her in a very immature way, to form an "I Hate Rachel Green" Club and spread a rumour about her, saying that she, as Ross put it, "had both male and female reproductive parts" and that, as Will put it, "her parents flipped a coin and decided to raise her as a girl" which everyone in the entire high school (apart from Rachel herself) heard (which may or may not have influenced Chip\'s unfaithfulness towards her).  Rachel also met Chandler Bing for the first time at Thanksgiving at Ross and Monica\'s house. Eventually drifting apart from Monica and Ross, Rachel met and got engaged to an orthodontist named Barry Farber, another careless and unpleasant-natured individual who was unfaithful toward her, cheating on her with both her best friend, Mindy and her selfish, shallow, unpleasant, self-absorbed sister Amy (although she didn\'t learn of this until after she eventually broke it off with him). Later, though, Rachel sleeps with him while he\'s engaged to Mindy, her former best friend.  Rachel\'s first appearance in The Pilot .  In 1994, Rachel jilts Barry at the altar and climbs out of the restroom window before running into Central Perk in a rain-soaked wedding dress, having just discovered she is more turned on by a gravy boat than by Barry. Her search for Monica , who she hasn\'t spoken to in several years, ends as she sees her and tells her what happened. Monica introduces Rachel to the rest of the group: Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and also reunites her with Ross, who eventually decides to suggest that he may someday ask her out on a date, a proposition she does not object to. Rachel confronts her father over the phone about her fleeing from the wedding and announces that she\'s moving in with Monica. She is excited about this new phase in life, until she is forced to get a job because her father has cut her off financially. She becomes a waitress at Central Perk.

The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.  Notes by Lesley Young  WALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The) - naxos.comWALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The)  The Castle of Otranto  \xa0  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister. He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797. In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

What’s Going On? According to Sondheim and Lapine  The painting’s setting is the island of la Grande Jatte, which is located northwest of Paris in the Seine River. In 1884 (when Seurat began working on his painting), the island was a pastoral place where people could go to get away from city life.

He is most famous for his work on television as Johnny Carson\'s sidekick, announcer, and second banana on The Tonight Show from 1962 through 1992. He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.

A popular idol, he inspired the Romantic mystique of the virtuoso and revolutionized violin technique.  Niccolò Paganini featured on a cigarette trading card.  © Hemera/Thinkstock  After initial study with his father, Paganini studied with a local violinist, G. Servetto, and then with the celebrated Giacomo Costa. He made his first appearance in 1793 and then studied with Alessandro Rolla and Gaspare Ghiretti at Parma . In 1797, accompanied by his father, he toured Lombardy, where with each concert his reputation grew. Gaining his independence soon after, he indulged excessively in gambling and romantic love affairs. At one point he pawned his violin because of gambling debts; a French merchant lent him a Guarneri violin to play a concert and, after hearing him, gave him the instrument.  Between 1801 and 1807 he wrote the 24 Capricci for unaccompanied violin, displaying the novel features of his technique, and the two sets of six sonatas for violin and guitar. He reappeared in Italy as a violinist in 1805 and was appointed director of music at Piombino by Napoleon ’s sister, Élisa Bonaparte Baciocchi . He later gave recitals of his own compositions in many towns in Italy and about 1824 formed his long attachment with the singer Antonia Bianchi.  In 1828 Paganini experienced great success in Vienna, and his appearances in Paris and London in 1831 were equally sensational. His tour of England and Scotland in 1832 made him a wealthy man. In 1833 he settled in Paris, where he commissioned Hector Berlioz to write his symphony Harold en Italie . Paganini thought that the challenge of its viola solo was too slight, however, and he never played it. Following the failure of the Casino Paganini, a gambling house in which he had invested, he went to Marseille in 1839, then to Nice.  Paganini, etching by Luigi Calamatta after a drawing by J.-A.-D.

Stories circulated that he was in league with the devil and that he had been imprisoned for murder; his burial in consecrated ground was delayed for five years. He was long regarded as a miser, but a more accurate portrait would consider his desire to be free from a train of dependent followers and their importunities for his largesse. His gift of 20,000 francs to the struggling composer Berlioz was an act of generosity seemingly uncharacteristic; possibly Paganini, recognizing in “ Beethoven ’s successor” a worthy talent, thought it was his duty to come to the composer’s aid.

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R.

Male and female adults are similar in plumage, which is predominantly brown and white. A common and familiar bird, this species of kookaburra is well known for its laughing call. The species was previously known as the Laughing Jackass and Giant Kingfisher. They live in close family groups where the young male offspring are driven out near maturity and the females usually stay on and assist the breeding adults in raising the new young by defending and feeding.

Additional information added by Avianweb  The Laughing Kookaburras (Dacelo novaeguineae) are Australian kingfishers that were named for their laughing calls.  In the past, it has been given the nicknames, the “Laughing Jackass” and the “Giant Kingfisher.” Its name comes from the Aboriginal language of the extinct Wiradhuri tribe.  Kookaburras occupy open woodland territories, forests and land on the edges of plains. It is the largest member of the Kingfisher family.  \xa0  Distribution and Habitat  The Laughing Kookaburras are indigenous to the woodlands of Eastern\xa0 mainland Australia , but they have also been introduced to Western Australia, Tasmania ,\xa0Flinders Island, Kangaroo Island , and New Zealand .  The Laughing Kookaburra prefers the mature trees in the woodlands, especially in the dry eucalyptus forests; however, it is a frequent guest in urban parks and gardens. Its territory is based on the availability of a consistent food supply and safe nesting sites.  Kookaburras can live 10 to 12 years in the wild, and they are not threatened or\xa0endangered.\xa0They remain in their territories year-round.  \xa0  Description  A familiar bird in its habitats, the Laughing Kookaburra is easily identifiable by its plumage, mainly shades of brown and white. This makes for excellent camouflage to protect it from its predators and hide it from its prey. Its head and bill are both large, and its eyes are brown. Its stocky, solidly built body is about 45 cm (18 in) long, from beak to tail, making it one of the most sizeable species in the Kingfisher family. The boat-shaped bill is bi-colored; the maxilla, or top part, is blue, and the lower part, or mandible, is a pale pink.  The sexes are dimorphic yet very similar. The female is larger than the male, and her rump contains fewer blue markings than the male’s. The body is cream-colored, and there is a dark brown stripe running through each eye and across the top of the beige-colored head. Another brown stripe runs from the eye to the back of the head on the side. Both the back and the wings are brown, although the wings include sparkling sky-blue markings on the shoulders. The tail is rufous reddish-orange with dark brown bars and white tips on the feathers.  The Laughing Kookaburra’s breast is filled with pale gray, wavy lines, and the outsides of the wings are covered with a scattering of blue markings. The male Laughing Kookaburra’s rump is often blue. The female is slightly larger than the male.  \xa0  Vocalizations  The name "Laughing Kookaburra | Question: "In Australia, what is known as a ""Laughing Jackass""?" ?', ['kookaburra', 'dacelo'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3486'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , the Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .

Question: What Is the Most Abundant Gas in the Earth\'s Atmosphere?  The Earth\'s atmosphere or air is composed of several gases. One gas is much more abundant than any other. Can you guess which one it is?  Answer:\xa0By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth\'s atmosphere is nitrogen , which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20-21%. Although humid air seems like it contains a lot of water, the maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is only about 4%.  Abundance of Gases in the Atmosphere  This table lists the eleven most abundant gases in the lower portion of Earth\'s atmosphere (up to 25 km). While the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen are fairly stable, the amount of greenhouse gases changes and depends on location. Water vapor is extremely variable. In arid or extremely cold regions, water vapor may be nearly absent. In warm, tropical regions, water vapor accounts for a significant portion of atmospheric gases.  continue reading below our video  Test Your General Science Knowledge  Some references include other gases on this list, such as krypton (less abundant than helium, but more than hydrogen), xenon (less abundant than hydrogen), nitrogen dioxide (less abundant than ozone), and iodine (less abundant than ozone).

The average concentration of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxde, methane, and nitrous dioxide has been increasing. Ozone is concentrated around cities and in the Earth\'s stratosphere. In addition to the elements in the table and krypton, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, and iodine (all mentioned earlier), there are trace amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and several other gases.  Why Is Important To Know the Abundance of Gases?  It\'s important to know which gas is most abundant, what the other gases are in the Earth\'s atmosphere, and how the composition of air changes with altitude and over time for multiple reasons. The information helps us understand and predict the weather. The amount of water vapor in air is particularly relevant to weather forecasting. The gas composition helps us understand the effects of natural and manmade chemicals released into the atmosphere. The make-up of the atmosphere is extremely important for climate, so changes in gases may help us predict broad climate change.

It is essential to all life and serves several purposes, such as providing air for respiration, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting the earth from falling meteorites, controlling climate and regulating the water cycle. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of approximately 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 1 percent argon and trace amounts of other gases that include carbon dioxide and neon.  Nitrogen  Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images  Nitrogen is a colorless, unscented and inert (does not react with other chemicals) gas. Chemist Daniel Rutherford first discovered this chemical element in 1772. Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere and is found in all living organisms. Nitrogen is an important component of amino acids, protein, DNA and RNA. All living organisms depend on nitrogen for growth, metabolic processes and reproduction.

She is played by Jennifer Aniston , who received Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe for her performance.  Contents  [ show ]  Early Life  Rachel Karen Green was born to Leonard and Sandra Green , who gave her and her two sisters Jill and Amy , a rather spoiled upbringing. She met Monica Geller for the first time when they were both six years old and they quickly became best friends, remaining exactly that from then until attending the same high school. Rachel also soon met Monica\'s older brother, Ross , who developed a crush on her which he ultimately decided to keep to himself.  She was also involved with an unpleasant-natured fellow high school student named Chip, who arrived late to take her out to the high school prom. When it appeared that Chip was never going to arrive, Ross, after being encouraged by his parents Jack and Judy , decided to ask her out himself, but missed his chance when Chip arrived before he could ask her. She soon learned how unpleasant, careless and unfaithful at his core Chip was when he ditched her at the prom to have sex with another girl named Amy Welsh .  Rachel herself, however, was a bully to an overweight student named Will Colbert , spurring him and his friend, Ross, who dealt with the fact that she never seemed to notice his feelings for her in a very immature way, to form an "I Hate Rachel Green" Club and spread a rumour about her, saying that she, as Ross put it, "had both male and female reproductive parts" and that, as Will put it, "her parents flipped a coin and decided to raise her as a girl" which everyone in the entire high school (apart from Rachel herself) heard (which may or may not have influenced Chip\'s unfaithfulness towards her).  Rachel also met Chandler Bing for the first time at Thanksgiving at Ross and Monica\'s house. Eventually drifting apart from Monica and Ross, Rachel met and got engaged to an orthodontist named Barry Farber, another careless and unpleasant-natured individual who was unfaithful toward her, cheating on her with both her best friend, Mindy and her selfish, shallow, unpleasant, self-absorbed sister Amy (although she didn\'t learn of this until after she eventually broke it off with him). Later, though, Rachel sleeps with him while he\'s engaged to Mindy, her former best friend.  Rachel\'s first appearance in The Pilot .  In 1994, Rachel jilts Barry at the altar and climbs out of the restroom window before running into Central Perk in a rain-soaked wedding dress, having just discovered she is more turned on by a gravy boat than by Barry. Her search for Monica , who she hasn\'t spoken to in several years, ends as she sees her and tells her what happened. Monica introduces Rachel to the rest of the group: Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and also reunites her with Ross, who eventually decides to suggest that he may someday ask her out on a date, a proposition she does not object to. Rachel confronts her father over the phone about her fleeing from the wedding and announces that she\'s moving in with Monica. She is excited about this new phase in life, until she is forced to get a job because her father has cut her off financially. She becomes a waitress at Central Perk.

When she visits him at his orthodontist office, she learns that he was cheating on her with her best friend Mindy Hunter . He also reveals that he went on their honeymoon with Mindy, which makes Rachel even more upset. She returns the ring and later takes comfort with Ross.

The castle is sited on a strategic rocky promontory by Pembroke River.  The first castle here was established in 1093 during the Norman invasion of Wales. It was a Norman motte and bailey with earthen ramparts and a timber palisade  The present structure owes much to William Marshal, "The Flower of Courtesy", one of the most powerful men in 12th-Century Britain.

Although only made from earth and wood, it resisted several Welsh attacks and sieges over the next 30 years, the castle establishing itself at the heart of the Norman-controlled lands of southwest Wales.  In the 12th century Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, eldest son of Roger de Montgomerie, was forced to forfeit his British lands and titles after he rebelled against King Henry I. By 1138 King Stephen had given Pembroke Castle to Gilbert de Clare who used it as a base in the Norman invasion of Ireland.  In August 1189 Richard I arranged the marriage of Isabel, Gilbert de Clare\'s granddaughter, to William Marshal who later received both the castle and the title, Earl of Pembroke. He set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive stone castle with a massive round stone keep - only royal towers of the period are comparable in scale. Marshall was succeeded by each of his five sons. His third son, Gilbert Marshal, was responsible for enlarging and further strengthening the castle between 1234 and 1241.  All of Marshal\'s sons died childless. In 1247, the castle was inherited by William de Valence, a half-brother of Henry III who became Earl of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan, William Marshal\'s granddaughter. The Valence family held Pembroke for 70 years. During this time, the town was fortified with defensive walls, three main gates and a postern.  Pembroke Castle became de Valence\'s military base for fighting the Welsh princes, during the conquest of North Wales by Edward I between 1277 and 1295.  On the death of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (son of William de Valence) the castle passed through marriage to the Hastings family. In 1389, 17-year-old John Hastings died in a jousting accident ending a line of inheritance stretching back 250 years.  The castle reverted to Richard II. Short tenancies were then granted by the Crown. By 1400 Owain Glyndwr had begun a rebellion in Wales, but Pembroke escaped attack because the castle\'s Constable, Francis а Court, paid off Glyndwr.  Eventually the castle and the earldom were presented to Jasper Tudor by his half-brother Henry VI in 1452. Tudor brought his widowed sister-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, to Pembroke where she gave birth to her only child, the future King Henry VII of England who was born in 1457.  In the 15th and 16th centuries the castle saw a period of peace. At the outbreak of the English Civil War most of South Wales sided with the King but Pembroke declared for Parliament. It was besieged by Royalist troops and saved after Parliamentary reinforcements arrived by sea from nearby Milford Haven.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ("Context: The Aleutian Islands ( Aleut : Tanam Unangaa , literally `` Land of the Aleuts '' ; pronounced ( / əˈluːʃən / ; possibly from Chukchi aliat , `` island '' ) are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller ones belonging to both the U.S. state of Alaska and the Russian federal subject of Kamchatka Krai .

This is a video from AnswersinGenesis correcting a lot of the common misconceptions about the famous Scopes Monkey Trial.  Check out GreenSlugg.com for more Creation vs. Evolution information.  Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

Their leader was William Quantrill and they included Jesse James and his brother Frank.     Early in the war, Missouri and Kansas, nominally under Union government, had become bandit country, with groups of Confederate bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers competing for control. The town of Lawrence, Kansas, a centre of anti-slavery sentiment, had outlawed Quantrill’s men and jailed some of their young womenfolk. In August 1863, Quantrill led a furious attack on the town, killing over 180 civilians, supposedly in retaliation for the casualties caused when the women’s jail had collapsed, possibly by design.  The Confederate government, which had granted Quantrill a field commission under the Partisan Ranger Act, was outraged and withdrew support for such irregular forces. By 1864, Quantrill had lost control of the group, which split-up into small bands. Some, including Quantrill, were killed in various engagements. Others lived on, to hold reunions many years later, when the name Quantrill\'s Raiders began to be used.  Origins  The Missouri-Kansas border area was fertile ground for the outbreak of guerrilla warfare when the Civil War erupted in 1861. Historian Albert Castel wrote:  In February 1861 Missouri voters elected delegates to a statewide convention, which rejected secession by a vote of 89-1. Unionists, led by regular U.S. Army commander Nathaniel Lyon and Frank Blair of the politically powerful Blair family, and increasingly pro-secessionist forces, led by governor Claiborne Jackson and future Confederate general Sterling Price, contested for the political and military control of the state. By June, there was open warfare between Union forces and troops supporting the Confederacy. Guerrilla warfare immediately erupted throughout the state and intensified in August after the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson\'s Creek.   By August 1862, with the Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge, the state was free of significant regular Confederate troops but the violence in Missouri continued. One historical work describes the situation in the state after Wilson\'s Creek:  The most notorious of these guerrilla forces was led by William Clarke Quantrill.  Methods and legal status  Quantrill was not the only Confederate guerrilla operating in Missouri, but he rapidly gained the greatest notoriety. He and his men ambushed Union patrols and supply convoys, seized the mail, and occasionally struck towns on either side of the Kansas-Missouri border. Reflecting the internecine nature of the guerrilla conflict in Missouri, Quantrill directed much of his effort against pro-Union civilians, attempting to drive them from the territory where he operated.  Quantrill\'s guerrillas attacked Jayhawkers, Union militia, and U.S. forces relying primarily on ambush and raids.   Under his direction, Confederate guerrillas perfected military tactics such as disguises, coordinated and synchronized attacks, planned dispersal after an attack using pre-planned routes and relays of horses, and technical methods, including the use of multiple .36 caliber Colt revolvers, for increased firepower and their improved accuracy over the .44 caliber.  Confederate induction  On 15 August 1862, Quantrill was granted a field commission as a captain in the Confederate army under the Confederate Partisan Ranger Act.  Other officers were elected by the men. Quantrill often referred to himself as a colonel. Despite the legal responsibility assumed by the Confederate government, Quantrill often acted on his own with little concern for his government\'s policy or orders.  His most notable operation was the Lawrence Massacre, a revenge raid on Lawrence, Kansas in August 1863.  Lawrence Massacre  Lawrence had historically been the base of operations for abolitionist and jayhawker organizations.  During the period of border warfare (1855-1861), known as "Bleeding Kansas" in the press, and during the Civil War, irregular raids into Missouri by abolitionists, redlegs, and jayhawkers and Union soldiers, resulted in robberies, theft, arson, and the murder of citizens.  In August 1863, Union authorities assigned to the border were frustrated by the hit-and-run tactics of Quantrill\'s guerrillas | Question: Quantrill\'s Raiders, a loosely organised force of Partisan rangers under the leadership of William Clarke Quantril, fought in which war?', ['american civil war'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3014'), ('Context: Michael Jackson sold 750 million Records Alive The Beatles sold 500 + million records Alive Elvis Presley sold 350 + million records Alive | Question: who sold more records michael jackson or the beatles ?', ['Michael Jackson'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-68341'), ("Context: Although previous attempts to create a Simpsons film had been made , they failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members .

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city.

Nicknames can help establish the identity of a city. They can also spread pride among its citizens.  New Orleans, Louisiana probably has more nicknames than any other American city. One web site lists more than twenty nicknames. The most famous is “The Big Easy.” It describes the gentle, slow and easy-going way of life in New Orleans.  Bourbon Street in New Orleans  So how did the city get this nickname? In the early 1900s there was a dance hall in New Orleans called “The Big Easy.” But the nickname did not become famous until the early 1970s. That was when a Louisiana newspaper writer began calling New Orleans by this name. She compared the easy-going way of life there to the hurried pace of life in New York City.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city.

Although only made from earth and wood, it resisted several Welsh attacks and sieges over the next 30 years, the castle establishing itself at the heart of the Norman-controlled lands of southwest Wales.  In the 12th century Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, eldest son of Roger de Montgomerie, was forced to forfeit his British lands and titles after he rebelled against King Henry I. By 1138 King Stephen had given Pembroke Castle to Gilbert de Clare who used it as a base in the Norman invasion of Ireland.  In August 1189 Richard I arranged the marriage of Isabel, Gilbert de Clare\'s granddaughter, to William Marshal who later received both the castle and the title, Earl of Pembroke. He set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive stone castle with a massive round stone keep - only royal towers of the period are comparable in scale. Marshall was succeeded by each of his five sons. His third son, Gilbert Marshal, was responsible for enlarging and further strengthening the castle between 1234 and 1241.  All of Marshal\'s sons died childless. In 1247, the castle was inherited by William de Valence, a half-brother of Henry III who became Earl of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan, William Marshal\'s granddaughter. The Valence family held Pembroke for 70 years. During this time, the town was fortified with defensive walls, three main gates and a postern.  Pembroke Castle became de Valence\'s military base for fighting the Welsh princes, during the conquest of North Wales by Edward I between 1277 and 1295.  On the death of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (son of William de Valence) the castle passed through marriage to the Hastings family. In 1389, 17-year-old John Hastings died in a jousting accident ending a line of inheritance stretching back 250 years.  The castle reverted to Richard II. Short tenancies were then granted by the Crown. By 1400 Owain Glyndwr had begun a rebellion in Wales, but Pembroke escaped attack because the castle\'s Constable, Francis а Court, paid off Glyndwr.  Eventually the castle and the earldom were presented to Jasper Tudor by his half-brother Henry VI in 1452. Tudor brought his widowed sister-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, to Pembroke where she gave birth to her only child, the future King Henry VII of England who was born in 1457.  In the 15th and 16th centuries the castle saw a period of peace. At the outbreak of the English Civil War most of South Wales sided with the King but Pembroke declared for Parliament.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

Their leader was William Quantrill and they included Jesse James and his brother Frank.     Early in the war, Missouri and Kansas, nominally under Union government, had become bandit country, with groups of Confederate bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers competing for control. The town of Lawrence, Kansas, a centre of anti-slavery sentiment, had outlawed Quantrill’s men and jailed some of their young womenfolk. In August 1863, Quantrill led a furious attack on the town, killing over 180 civilians, supposedly in retaliation for the casualties caused when the women’s jail had collapsed, possibly by design.  The Confederate government, which had granted Quantrill a field commission under the Partisan Ranger Act, was outraged and withdrew support for such irregular forces. By 1864, Quantrill had lost control of the group, which split-up into small bands. Some, including Quantrill, were killed in various engagements. Others lived on, to hold reunions many years later, when the name Quantrill\'s Raiders began to be used.  Origins  The Missouri-Kansas border area was fertile ground for the outbreak of guerrilla warfare when the Civil War erupted in 1861. Historian Albert Castel wrote:  In February 1861 Missouri voters elected delegates to a statewide convention, which rejected secession by a vote of 89-1. Unionists, led by regular U.S. Army commander Nathaniel Lyon and Frank Blair of the politically powerful Blair family, and increasingly pro-secessionist forces, led by governor Claiborne Jackson and future Confederate general Sterling Price, contested for the political and military control of the state. By June, there was open warfare between Union forces and troops supporting the Confederacy. Guerrilla warfare immediately erupted throughout the state and intensified in August after the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson\'s Creek.   By August 1862, with the Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge, the state was free of significant regular Confederate troops but the violence in Missouri continued. One historical work describes the situation in the state after Wilson\'s Creek:  The most notorious of these guerrilla forces was led by William Clarke Quantrill.  Methods and legal status  Quantrill was not the only Confederate guerrilla operating in Missouri, but he rapidly gained the greatest notoriety. He and his men ambushed Union patrols and supply convoys, seized the mail, and occasionally struck towns on either side of the Kansas-Missouri border. Reflecting the internecine nature of the guerrilla conflict in Missouri, Quantrill directed much of his effort against pro-Union civilians, attempting to drive them from the territory where he operated.  Quantrill\'s guerrillas attacked Jayhawkers, Union militia, and U.S. forces relying primarily on ambush and raids.   Under his direction, Confederate guerrillas perfected military tactics such as disguises, coordinated and synchronized attacks, planned dispersal after an attack using pre-planned routes and relays of horses, and technical methods, including the use of multiple .36 caliber Colt revolvers, for increased firepower and their improved accuracy over the .44 caliber.  Confederate induction  On 15 August 1862, Quantrill was granted a field commission as a captain in the Confederate army under the Confederate Partisan Ranger Act.  Other officers were elected by the men. Quantrill often referred to himself as a colonel. Despite the legal responsibility assumed by the Confederate government, Quantrill often acted on his own with little concern for his government\'s policy or orders.  His most notable operation was the Lawrence Massacre, a revenge raid on Lawrence, Kansas in August 1863.  Lawrence Massacre  Lawrence had historically been the base of operations for abolitionist and jayhawker organizations.  During the period of border warfare (1855-1861), known as "Bleeding Kansas" in the press, and during the Civil War, irregular raids into Missouri by abolitionists, redlegs, and jayhawkers and Union soldiers, resulted in robberies, theft, arson, and the murder of citizens.  In August 1863, Union authorities assigned to the border were frustrated by the hit-and-run tactics of Quantrill\'s guerrillas | Question: Quantrill\'s Raiders, a loosely organised force of Partisan rangers under the leadership of William Clarke Quantril, fought in which war?', ['american civil war'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3014'), ('Context: Michael Jackson sold 750 million Records Alive The Beatles sold 500 + million records Alive Elvis Presley sold 350 + million records Alive | Question: who sold more records michael jackson or the beatles ?', ['Michael Jackson'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-68341'), ("Context: Although previous attempts to create a Simpsons film had been made , they failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members .

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city.

One web site lists more than twenty nicknames. The most famous is “The Big Easy.” It describes the gentle, slow and easy-going way of life in New Orleans.  Bourbon Street in New Orleans  So how did the city get this nickname? In the early 1900s there was a dance hall in New Orleans called “The Big Easy.” But the nickname did not become famous until the early 1970s. That was when a Louisiana newspaper writer began calling New Orleans by this name. She compared the easy-going way of life there to the hurried pace of life in New York City.  In 1970, James Conaway wrote a crime novel called “The Big Easy.” The story was set in New Orleans. In 1987, that book was made into a film which made the nickname even more popular.  New Orleans has other nicknames. One of them is “The Crescent City.” During the 19th century, new neighborhoods expanded out from what is now known as the French Quarter. These areas followed the great curve of the Mississippi River, giving New Orleans the shape of a crescent.  Port of New Orleans  Another nickname is “The Birthplace of Jazz,” because that kind of music started in New Orleans. It is also called “Mardi Gras City” for the wild celebrations and parades that take place there every year. And, there is a nickname that uses the short way to write New Orleans and Louisiana.

Recipients of this award may add G.C. after their names; the cross ranks second only to the Victoria Cross (the highest British military decoration). The cross is silver, with one side depicting St. George slaying the dragon and with the inscription “For Gallantry;” the other side gives the recipient’s name and the date of the award.  The George Medal, instituted at the same time as the George Cross, is analogous to it but is awarded for services not quite so outstanding as those which merit the George Cross.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously. Three women were awarded the GC for resistance activities in occupied  territories during WW 2. One of them was Noor Inayat Khan.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city. The nickname became more commonplace in the years that followed.

Nicknames can help establish the identity of a city. They can also spread pride among its citizens.  New Orleans, Louisiana probably has more nicknames than any other American city. One web site lists more than twenty nicknames. The most famous is “The Big Easy.” It describes the gentle, slow and easy-going way of life in New Orleans.  Bourbon Street in New Orleans  So how did the city get this nickname? In the early 1900s there was a dance hall in New Orleans called “The Big Easy.” But the nickname did not become famous until the early 1970s. That was when a Louisiana newspaper writer began calling New Orleans by this name. She compared the easy-going way of life there to the hurried pace of life in New York City.  In 1970, James Conaway wrote a crime novel called “The Big Easy.” The story was set in New Orleans. In 1987, that book was made into a film which made the nickname even more popular.  New Orleans has other nicknames. One of them is “The Crescent City.” During the 19th century, new neighborhoods expanded out from what is now known as the French Quarter. These areas followed the great curve of the Mississippi River, giving New Orleans the shape of a crescent.  Port of New Orleans  Another nickname is “The Birthplace of Jazz,” because that kind of music started in New Orleans. It is also called “Mardi Gras City” for the wild celebrations and parades that take place there every year. And, there is a nickname that uses the short way to write New Orleans and Louisiana. It you do not want to use the complete name, you can call the city “NOLA.”  One of America’s most exciting cities is Las Vegas, Nevada. There you can play games of chance all night long.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

Belgians were the first to experiment with fruit, adding raspberry and cherry into the mix, and today brewers have taken things even further, sweetening their suds with apples, blueberries, bananas and more.\xa0  Take a look at Gayot.com’s list of the top 10 fruit beers to find everything from tart lambics to crisp saisons to creamy strawberry beer.  1. Raspberry Redemption  Gayot.com  Joseph James Brewing Company - Henderson, NV  This microbrewery in Henderson, Nevada, is not shy about making extreme beers. Their Raspberry Redemption contains no sweet, syrupy fruit concentrate, but rather loads of the real McCoy. Eighty pounds of fresh raspberries are added during the boil. After the beer is done fermenting, it\'s transferred onto another 600 pounds of fresh raspberries, where it sits for three months, soaking up the true flavor of the fruit. Fifty pounds of Hershey\'s raw cocoa and Belgian candi sugar are also put in while the beer is cooking, which provides some sweet balance to the tartness of the true raspberry flavor of this beer. After bottling, this brew goes through a secondary fermentation, providing a natural carbonation, so this bottle-conditioned beer will have some natural yeast sediment left in the bottle after pouring.  Style: Belgian-Style Dubbel  Price: $11.99 for 750 ml  2. Lindemans Pomme  Gayot.com  Brouwerij Lindemans - Vlezenbeek, Belgium  The Lindemans brewery has its roots as a family farm with a small brewery that began the commercial brewing of lambic ales in 1811. The fruit seasoning this lambic is apple (pomme is French for apple). Long before hops were common in most beers, fruits and herbs were used as bittering agents! As with all Belgian lambics, immediately after being brewed the beer is left in vats open to the outside air, where it is fermented by a variety of wild yeasts. The yeast provides plenty of tartness, as do the fresh apples that are added during a secondary fermentation. This apple lambic pours a light golden hue with a thick foamy head of tightly packed bubbles. An aroma of sweet and sour apple dominates, which may remind you of a Sour Apple Jolly Rancher candy. A Granny Smith Apple sweet and sour flavor continues as you sip, with sweetness up front turning to tartness in the aftertaste. Unlike ciders, which tend to be overly sweet, this lambic has other complexities compliments of the yeast. This beer has a diminutive 3.5 percent alcohol content, making it easy drinking.  Style: Lambic/Fruit  Gayot.com  Lost Coast Brewery - Eureka, CA  One of the few breweries to be founded by women, Lost Coast Brewery in California\'s Humboldt Bay region began in 1986 when homebrewers Barbara Groom and Wendy Pound wondered what it would be like to open their own brewpub. From its humble beginnings, Lost Coast has grown exponentially and is now the 49th largest brewery in the U.S. and 36th largest craft brewery in the nation. This wheat beer pours a beautiful burnt orange honey color. Its aroma is anything but subtle and will remind you of a freshly peeled tangerine. Upon tasting, this beer makes a transformation, with an initial flavor delivering a mild tangerine sweetness that, after swallowing, turns into a tangy aftertaste with bitterness reminiscent of tangerine peel zest. Both flavors blend well with the combination of wheat and crystal malts and Perle finishing hops. Tangerine Wheat is one of Lost Coast\'s two fruit beer offerings, the other being its Raspberry Brown.  Style: Fruit Beer  Gayot.com  New Belgium Brewing - Fort Collins, CO  Released in 2012 as part of New Belgium Brewing\'s Lips of Faith series, this ale was crafted in honor of alternative hip hop and blues musician G.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

After a week in which the controversial payday lender reported a 51pc drop in net profit and decided to to write off the debts of 330,000 customers , the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has hit Wonga with another blow.  The Financial Times reports that the ASA has banned the ad as it fails to show the representative annual interest rate on Wonga loans.  The banned advert implies that customers could “save money” by taking out a loan at Wonga, but neglected to mention any interest rate that comes with it.  Wonga has reportedly been told the advert must not appear again in its current form.  Advertising from the payday loan sector has come under heavy scrutiny this year, with four other companies also having TV ads prohibited.  However, the government has rejected calls to ban outright the payday lenders from advertising on children’s TV .  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who are responsible for regulation of the industry, has recommended payday loans adverts carry a “health warning”. As an example, it suggested: "Warning: Late repayment can cause you serious money problems. For help, go to www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk".  Earlier this year a different Wonga advert was banned for “misleading” viewers about the lenders’ interest rates.  The ad featured two puppets talking about how to secure a loan from Wonga, with one of them describing interest rates over 5,000pc as being “irrelevant”. The clip formed part of a series of ads featuring puppets called Betty, Earl and Joyce.  In a bid to clean up the brands’ public image, the puppet ads were swiftly dropped by Wonga chairman Andy Haste when he came into the role in July. He said his intention was to shed any advertising which “could attract children”.  Wonga has endured a rough patch recently - a fall in profits has prompted the company to reconsider its sponsorship of Newcastle United .  The company also decided to write off the debt of 330,00 customers as it attempts to "improve standards in consumer credit".

Brand equity is the precious objective behind every brand strategy and, for all of its value, the concept itself is really rather straightforward.

Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

Research summarized  Evidence reviews  Local treatment with Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin following surgery for superficial bladder cancer reduces the risk of the cancer returning.  Worldwide, bladder cancer is common in both men and women. In most cases, the cancer occurs in the superficial layers of the bladder and can be surgically removed. However, in many people the cancer returns. Drugs placed directly into the bladder tissue following surgery are therefore often used to try to prevent the cancer recurring. Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated bacterium used for immunization against\xa0tuberculosis, and is safe and effective for that purpose;\xa0it has also been licensed by the US FDA and other national regulatory agencies for use in\xa0superficial bladder‐cancer treatment. The review found that BCG treatment was effective in preventing cancer recurrence following surgery. Further studies into making treatment more effective are needed.  Intravesical Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin versus epirubicin for Ta and T1 bladder cancer  Transurethral resection (TUR) is the usual treatment method for patients who, when examined with a cystoscope, are found to have abnormal growths on the urothelium (stage Ta) and/or in the lamina propria (stage T1). However post‐operation tumour recurrence is a major clinical problem. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin or epirubicin following surgery are therefore often used to try to prevent the cancer recurrence. This review found that intravesical Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin is more efficacious than epirubicin to prevent cancer recurrence. However, Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin appears to induce greater local and systemic adverse effects than epirubicin.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

Belgians were the first to experiment with fruit, adding raspberry and cherry into the mix, and today brewers have taken things even further, sweetening their suds with apples, blueberries, bananas and more.\xa0  Take a look at Gayot.com’s list of the top 10 fruit beers to find everything from tart lambics to crisp saisons to creamy strawberry beer.  1. Raspberry Redemption  Gayot.com  Joseph James Brewing Company - Henderson, NV  This microbrewery in Henderson, Nevada, is not shy about making extreme beers. Their Raspberry Redemption contains no sweet, syrupy fruit concentrate, but rather loads of the real McCoy. Eighty pounds of fresh raspberries are added during the boil. After the beer is done fermenting, it\'s transferred onto another 600 pounds of fresh raspberries, where it sits for three months, soaking up the true flavor of the fruit. Fifty pounds of Hershey\'s raw cocoa and Belgian candi sugar are also put in while the beer is cooking, which provides some sweet balance to the tartness of the true raspberry flavor of this beer. After bottling, this brew goes through a secondary fermentation, providing a natural carbonation, so this bottle-conditioned beer will have some natural yeast sediment left in the bottle after pouring.  Style: Belgian-Style Dubbel  Price: $11.99 for 750 ml  2. Lindemans Pomme  Gayot.com  Brouwerij Lindemans - Vlezenbeek, Belgium  The Lindemans brewery has its roots as a family farm with a small brewery that began the commercial brewing of lambic ales in 1811. The fruit seasoning this lambic is apple (pomme is French for apple). Long before hops were common in most beers, fruits and herbs were used as bittering agents! As with all Belgian lambics, immediately after being brewed the beer is left in vats open to the outside air, where it is fermented by a variety of wild yeasts. The yeast provides plenty of tartness, as do the fresh apples that are added during a secondary fermentation. This apple lambic pours a light golden hue with a thick foamy head of tightly packed bubbles. An aroma of sweet and sour apple dominates, which may remind you of a Sour Apple Jolly Rancher candy. A Granny Smith Apple sweet and sour flavor continues as you sip, with sweetness up front turning to tartness in the aftertaste. Unlike ciders, which tend to be overly sweet, this lambic has other complexities compliments of the yeast. This beer has a diminutive 3.5 percent alcohol content, making it easy drinking.  Style: Lambic/Fruit  Gayot.com  Lost Coast Brewery - Eureka, CA  One of the few breweries to be founded by women, Lost Coast Brewery in California\'s Humboldt Bay region began in 1986 when homebrewers Barbara Groom and Wendy Pound wondered what it would be like to open their own brewpub. From its humble beginnings, Lost Coast has grown exponentially and is now the 49th largest brewery in the U.S. and 36th largest craft brewery in the nation. This wheat beer pours a beautiful burnt orange honey color. Its aroma is anything but subtle and will remind you of a freshly peeled tangerine. Upon tasting, this beer makes a transformation, with an initial flavor delivering a mild tangerine sweetness that, after swallowing, turns into a tangy aftertaste with bitterness reminiscent of tangerine peel zest. Both flavors blend well with the combination of wheat and crystal malts and Perle finishing hops. Tangerine Wheat is one of Lost Coast\'s two fruit beer offerings, the other being its Raspberry Brown.  Style: Fruit Beer  Gayot.com  New Belgium Brewing - Fort Collins, CO  Released in 2012 as part of New Belgium Brewing\'s Lips of Faith series, this ale was crafted in honor of alternative hip hop and blues musician G.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

After a week in which the controversial payday lender reported a 51pc drop in net profit and decided to to write off the debts of 330,000 customers , the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has hit Wonga with another blow.  The Financial Times reports that the ASA has banned the ad as it fails to show the representative annual interest rate on Wonga loans.  The banned advert implies that customers could “save money” by taking out a loan at Wonga, but neglected to mention any interest rate that comes with it.  Wonga has reportedly been told the advert must not appear again in its current form.  Advertising from the payday loan sector has come under heavy scrutiny this year, with four other companies also having TV ads prohibited.  However, the government has rejected calls to ban outright the payday lenders from advertising on children’s TV .  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), who are responsible for regulation of the industry, has recommended payday loans adverts carry a “health warning”. As an example, it suggested: "Warning: Late repayment can cause you serious money problems. For help, go to www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk".  Earlier this year a different Wonga advert was banned for “misleading” viewers about the lenders’ interest rates.  The ad featured two puppets talking about how to secure a loan from Wonga, with one of them describing interest rates over 5,000pc as being “irrelevant”. The clip formed part of a series of ads featuring puppets called Betty, Earl and Joyce.  In a bid to clean up the brands’ public image, the puppet ads were swiftly dropped by Wonga chairman Andy Haste when he came into the role in July. He said his intention was to shed any advertising which “could attract children”.  Wonga has endured a rough patch recently - a fall in profits has prompted the company to reconsider its sponsorship of Newcastle United .  The company also decided to write off the debt of 330,00 customers as it attempts to "improve standards in consumer credit".

Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ("Context: The name Moloch results from a dysphemic vocalisation in the Second Temple period of a theonym based on the root mlk `` king '' .

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens.

Titanic records mostly consist of plans for the ship, information on how the ship was built, as well as passenger manifests, which are deemed incomplete. Other Titanic records are largely made up from eyewitness accounts and stories and journals passed down in families whose ancestors were part of the Titanic voyage.  Titanic records prove that the ship was the largest one ever made back in 1912. Titanic records also show that the ship cost $7.5 million to construct and was made by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Ireland. Over 14,000 men helped build this epic ship over three years, and the Titanic was advertised to be the most luxurious and safest floating 5 star hotel, sporting the first swimming pool on a cruise ship.  Titanic records show the ship sailed safely from Belfast to Southampton, England, where it was docked until its maiden voyage was set for April 10, 1912. After only four days at sea, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank on April 15.  Titanic Timeline  April 2-3, 1912: The Titanic sailed from Belfast, Ireland to Southampton, England in preparation for its maiden voyage across the Atlantic.  April 14, 1912; 11:40 pm: Quartermaster Robert Hitchens was steering the ship when the Titanic hit an iceberg. Prior to this, the Titanic had received multiple warnings regarding sightings of icebergs, but remained full steam ahead.  April 15, 1912; 12:00-12:25 am: Captain Smith is notified that all six watertight compartments are damaged, and the Titanic will sink in two hours. By 12:25 am, Captain Smith orders crew to start filling lifeboats with women and children.  April 15, 1912; 12:45-2:17 am: Lifeboats are launched during this period as the Titanic continues to send out distress signals.  April 15, 1912; 2:20 am: The Titanic breaks into two pieces and sinks below the ocean\'s surface, taking many passengers with it.  Titanic Newspaper Articles  Daily Review  The Daily Review, published in Decatur, Illinois on April 15, 1912, unfortunately carried the important story of the sinking of the Titanic. This Titanic newspaper account revealed that aboard the ship\'s maiden voyage from England bound for New York were Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob Astor, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderbilt, Major Archibald Butt, journalist William Thomas Stead and Benjamin Guggenheim.  The main headline surrounding the sinking of the ship in this Titanic newspaper was the fact that wireless telegraphy had not failed, but prevailed since surrounding ocean liners were able to hear the Titanic\'s distress calls. Unfortunately, these liners weren\'t in a position to respond quickly enough to rescue the large amounts of lower class passengers and crew members that went down with the Titanic due to a shortage of lifeboats.  This Titanic newspaper account also described the basic, well-known facts of the time surrounding the Titanic, including that it was the biggest boat in the world. Also noted was the fact that an unusual amount of icebergs were reported in the area by other ships. Also written up was the fact that a special train designated for transporting Titanic survivors was being organized with the New Haven Railroad. Many of these survivors were taken to Halifax and would catch this train there.  This Titanic newspaper also displayed a photo of the Titanic prior to its fateful journey to the bottom of the ocean, but the majority of the front page is taken up with other news, both local and national, including the skirmishes that were taking place between the Republicans and Democrats.  Trenton Evening Times  The Trenton Evening Times published its Titanic newspaper articles on April 15, 1912, after learning initial facts from the tragic sinking. The main Titanic newspaper article described that the Titanic was due in New York the next day and was on course a day ahead of schedule, indicating high speeds, before it struck an iceberg. Also described was the general specs of that enormous ship, which was the largest ship ever built in 1912. | Question: "What ""unsinkable"" ship sank in April 1912?" ?', ['titanic', 'rms titanic'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3860'), ('Context: County MayoCounty Mayo (, meaning "Plain of the yew trees") is a county in Ireland.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ("Context: The name Moloch results from a dysphemic vocalisation in the Second Temple period of a theonym based on the root mlk `` king '' .

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens.

Titanic records also show that the ship cost $7.5 million to construct and was made by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Ireland. Over 14,000 men helped build this epic ship over three years, and the Titanic was advertised to be the most luxurious and safest floating 5 star hotel, sporting the first swimming pool on a cruise ship.  Titanic records show the ship sailed safely from Belfast to Southampton, England, where it was docked until its maiden voyage was set for April 10, 1912. After only four days at sea, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank on April 15.  Titanic Timeline  April 2-3, 1912: The Titanic sailed from Belfast, Ireland to Southampton, England in preparation for its maiden voyage across the Atlantic.  April 14, 1912; 11:40 pm: Quartermaster Robert Hitchens was steering the ship when the Titanic hit an iceberg. Prior to this, the Titanic had received multiple warnings regarding sightings of icebergs, but remained full steam ahead.  April 15, 1912; 12:00-12:25 am: Captain Smith is notified that all six watertight compartments are damaged, and the Titanic will sink in two hours. By 12:25 am, Captain Smith orders crew to start filling lifeboats with women and children.  April 15, 1912; 12:45-2:17 am: Lifeboats are launched during this period as the Titanic continues to send out distress signals.  April 15, 1912; 2:20 am: The Titanic breaks into two pieces and sinks below the ocean\'s surface, taking many passengers with it.  Titanic Newspaper Articles  Daily Review  The Daily Review, published in Decatur, Illinois on April 15, 1912, unfortunately carried the important story of the sinking of the Titanic. This Titanic newspaper account revealed that aboard the ship\'s maiden voyage from England bound for New York were Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob Astor, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderbilt, Major Archibald Butt, journalist William Thomas Stead and Benjamin Guggenheim.  The main headline surrounding the sinking of the ship in this Titanic newspaper was the fact that wireless telegraphy had not failed, but prevailed since surrounding ocean liners were able to hear the Titanic\'s distress calls. Unfortunately, these liners weren\'t in a position to respond quickly enough to rescue the large amounts of lower class passengers and crew members that went down with the Titanic due to a shortage of lifeboats.  This Titanic newspaper account also described the basic, well-known facts of the time surrounding the Titanic, including that it was the biggest boat in the world. Also noted was the fact that an unusual amount of icebergs were reported in the area by other ships. Also written up was the fact that a special train designated for transporting Titanic survivors was being organized with the New Haven Railroad. Many of these survivors were taken to Halifax and would catch this train there.  This Titanic newspaper also displayed a photo of the Titanic prior to its fateful journey to the bottom of the ocean, but the majority of the front page is taken up with other news, both local and national, including the skirmishes that were taking place between the Republicans and Democrats.  Trenton Evening Times  The Trenton Evening Times published its Titanic newspaper articles on April 15, 1912, after learning initial facts from the tragic sinking. The main Titanic newspaper article described that the Titanic was due in New York the next day and was on course a day ahead of schedule, indicating high speeds, before it struck an iceberg. Also described was the general specs of that enormous ship, which was the largest ship ever built in 1912. | Question: "What ""unsinkable"" ship sank in April 1912?" ?', ['titanic', 'rms titanic'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3860'), ('Context: County MayoCounty Mayo (, meaning "Plain of the yew trees") is a county in Ireland.  In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.  The west consists largely of poor subsoils and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket bog, whereas the east is largely a limestone landscape.  Agricultural land is therefore more productive in the east than in the west.  *The highest point in Mayo (and Connacht) is Mweelrea, at 814 m  *The River Moy in the northeast of the county is renowned for its salmon fishing  *Ireland\'s largest island, Achill Island, lies off Mayo\'s west coast  *Mayo has Ireland\'s highest cliffs at Croaghaun, Achill Island,  while the Benwee Head cliffs in Kilcommon Erris drop almost perpendicularly 900 ft into the Atlantic Ocean.   )  *The northwest areas of County Mayo have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, if not the world, in terms of wind resources, ocean wave, tidal and hydroelectric resources     Local government and political subdivisions  Mayo County Council () is the authority responsible for local government.  As a county council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. The County is divided into four municipal areas Castlebar, Ballina, Claremorris and West (an area which stretches from Westport to Belmullet). The council is responsible for housing and community, roads and transportation, urban planning and development, amenity and culture, and environment. For the purpose of local elections the county is divided into its four municipal districts, replacing the former six local electoral areas: Ballina (6), Belmullet (4), Castlebar (7), Claremorris (6), Swinford (4) and Westport (4).   The county town is at Áras an Contae in Castlebar the main population centre located in the centre of the county.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

Charlotte is home to the corporate headquarters of Bank of America and the east coast operations of Wells Fargo, which along with other financial institutions makes it the second largest banking center in the United States.  Among Charlotte\'s many notable attractions, some of the most popular include the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL), the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Charlotte Independence of the United Soccer League (USL), two NASCAR Sprint Cup races and the NASCAR All-Star Race, the Wells Fargo Championship, the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Carowinds amusement park, and the U.S. National Whitewater Center. Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a major international hub, and was ranked the 23rd busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic in 2013.   Nicknamed the Queen City, like its county a few years earlier, Charlotte was named in honor of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had become the Queen of Great Britain just seven years before the town\'s incorporation. A second nickname derives from the American Revolutionary War, when British commander General Cornwallis occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents, prompting him to write that Charlotte was "a hornet\'s nest of rebellion", leading to the nickname The Hornet\'s Nest.  Charlotte has a humid subtropical climate. Charlotte is located several miles east of the Catawba River and southeast of Lake Norman, the largest man-made lake in North Carolina. Lake Wylie and Mountain Island Lake are two smaller man-made lakes located near the city.  History  The Catawba Native Americans were the first to settle Mecklenburg County (in the Charlotte area) and were first recorded in European records around 1567. By 1759 half the Catawba tribe had been killed by smallpox. At the time of their largest population, Catawba people numbered 10,000, but by 1826 that number dropped to 110.   Mecklenburg County was initially part of Bath County (1696 to 1729) of New Hanover Precinct, which became New Hanover County in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into Bladen County in 1734, its western portion splitting into Anson County in 1750. Mecklenburg County formed from Anson County in 1762, with further apportionment in 1792, with Cabarrus County formed from Mecklenburg, and in 1842, with Union County formed from Mecklenburg\'s southeastern portion. These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the Salisbury District.   The area that is now Charlotte was settled by people of European descent around 1755, when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. Thomas Polk (granduncle of U.S.\xa0President James K. Polk), who later married Thomas Spratt\'s daughter, built his house by the intersection of two Native American trading paths between the Yadkin and Catawba rivers.   One path ran north–south and was part of the Great Wagon Road; the second path ran east–west along what is now Trade Street. Within decades of Polk\'s settling, the area grew to become "Charlotte Town", incorporating in 1768.  The crossroads, perched atop the Piedmont landscape, became the heart of Uptown Charlotte.  In 1770, surveyors marked the streets in a grid pattern for future development. | Question: Opened in May 11, 2010, Charlotte, NC is the home to the Hall of Fame for what popular outdoor sport, the second most watched sport (on TV) in the US?', ['nascar', 'national association for stock car auto racing'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7598'), ('Context: A prototype of an ombudsman may have flourished in China during the Qin Dynasty ( 221 BC ) , and in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty .

Travis (for the regular army) and Jim Bowie (for the volunteers).  Over the following two weeks, the Mexican forces continually strengthened to over 2000 troops.  During the same period, a few reinforcements for the Texans answered Travis\' famous Appeal for Aid and managed to penetrate enemy lines and enter the Alamo grounds, bringing the total strength of the defenders to about 189 men.  After periodic bombardment, the siege ended on the morning of 6 March when the Mexicans storm the Alamo fortress.  During the battle, all of the Texan defenders were killed.  Several non-combatants were spared, including Susanna Dickenson, the wife of one of the defenders, Susanna\'s baby, and a servant of Travis.  Partly to reinforce his goal of terrorizing colonists in Texas, Santa Anna released this small party to inform Texans of the fate of the defenders.  Losses in the battle have been placed at 189 Texans against about 1600 for the Mexicans.  The Alamo - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.comThe Alamo - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com  Google  Early History of the Alamo  Spanish settlers built the Mission San Antonio de Valero, named for St. Anthony of Padua, on the banks of the San Antonio River around 1718. They also established the nearby military garrison of San Antonio de Béxar, which soon became the center of a settlement known as San Fernando de Béxar (later renamed San Antonio). The Mission San Antonio de Valero housed missionaries and their Native American converts for some 70 years until 1793, when Spanish authorities secularized the five missions located in San Antonio and distributed their lands among local residents.  Did You Know?  Ten years after Texas won its independence and shortly after it was annexed by the United States, U.S. soldiers revived the "Remember the Alamo!" battle cry while fighting against Mexican forces in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.  Beginning in the early 1800s, Spanish military troops were stationed in the abandoned chapel of the former mission. Because it stood in a grove of cottonwood trees, the soldiers called their new fort “El Alamo” after the Spanish word for cottonwood and in honor of Alamo de Parras, their hometown in Mexico . Military troops–first Spanish, then rebel and later Mexican–occupied the Alamo during and after Mexico’s successful war for independence from Spain in the early 1820s. In the summer of 1821, Stephen Austin arrived in San Antonio along with some 300 U.S. families that the Spanish government had allowed to settle in Texas . The migration of U.S. citizens to Texas increased over the next decades, sparking a revolutionary movement that would erupt into armed conflict by the mid-1830s.  The Battle of the Alamo  In December 1835, in the early stages of Texas’ war for independence from Mexico, a group of Texan (or Texian) volunteers led by George Collinsworth and Benjamin Milam overwhelmed the Mexican garrison at the Alamo and captured the fort, seizing control of San Antonio. By mid-February 1836, Colonel James Bowie and Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis had taken command of Texan forces in San Antonio. Though Sam Houston , the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Texan forces, argued that San Antonio should be abandoned due to insufficient troop numbers, the Alamo’s defenders–led by Bowie and Travis–dug in nonetheless, prepared to defend the fort to the last. These defenders, who despite later reinforcements never numbered more than 200, included Davy Crockett , the famous frontiersman and former congressman from Tennessee | Question: Where was the siege of the Alamo?', ['texas', 'texas state'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2999'), ("Context: Spencer Plaza was built in 1863 -- 1864 , established by Charles Durant and J.W.

Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008.

Published on Jan 2, 2009  One  wonderful  waltz  of   Johann Strauss  Johann Strauss II (October 25, 1825 -- June 3, 1899; also known as fully Johann Baptist Strauss, and Johann Strauss, Jr. was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

Plot summary  Receiving a tip from his dentist Jack Shorter, Inspector Peter Pascoe takes a closer look at the Calliope Kinema Club, a film club notorious for showing adult entertainment movies. Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn\'t suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter\'s concerns are unnecessary. Meanwhile, the "Calli" has been vandalised and its proprietor Gilbert Haggard has been assaulted so badly that he succumbs to a heart attack. The only existing copy of "Droit de Seigneur" - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed, and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her (yet unborn) child, it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the "Calli".

It was shown on the ITV network in three parts over consecutive Saturdays beginning on 9 April. However, Reginald Hill is said to have been unhappy with the series and it subsequently remains the only one to star Hale and Pace in the leading roles.

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a major international hub, and was ranked the 23rd busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic in 2013.   Nicknamed the Queen City, like its county a few years earlier, Charlotte was named in honor of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had become the Queen of Great Britain just seven years before the town\'s incorporation. A second nickname derives from the American Revolutionary War, when British commander General Cornwallis occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents, prompting him to write that Charlotte was "a hornet\'s nest of rebellion", leading to the nickname The Hornet\'s Nest.  Charlotte has a humid subtropical climate. Charlotte is located several miles east of the Catawba River and southeast of Lake Norman, the largest man-made lake in North Carolina. Lake Wylie and Mountain Island Lake are two smaller man-made lakes located near the city.  History  The Catawba Native Americans were the first to settle Mecklenburg County (in the Charlotte area) and were first recorded in European records around 1567. By 1759 half the Catawba tribe had been killed by smallpox. At the time of their largest population, Catawba people numbered 10,000, but by 1826 that number dropped to 110.   Mecklenburg County was initially part of Bath County (1696 to 1729) of New Hanover Precinct, which became New Hanover County in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into Bladen County in 1734, its western portion splitting into Anson County in 1750. Mecklenburg County formed from Anson County in 1762, with further apportionment in 1792, with Cabarrus County formed from Mecklenburg, and in 1842, with Union County formed from Mecklenburg\'s southeastern portion. These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the Salisbury District.   The area that is now Charlotte was settled by people of European descent around 1755, when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. Thomas Polk (granduncle of U.S.\xa0President James K. Polk), who later married Thomas Spratt\'s daughter, built his house by the intersection of two Native American trading paths between the Yadkin and Catawba rivers.   One path ran north–south and was part of the Great Wagon Road; the second path ran east–west along what is now Trade Street. Within decades of Polk\'s settling, the area grew to become "Charlotte Town", incorporating in 1768.  The crossroads, perched atop the Piedmont landscape, became the heart of Uptown Charlotte.  In 1770, surveyors marked the streets in a grid pattern for future development. | Question: Opened in May 11, 2010, Charlotte, NC is the home to the Hall of Fame for what popular outdoor sport, the second most watched sport (on TV) in the US?', ['nascar', 'national association for stock car auto racing'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7598'), ('Context: A prototype of an ombudsman may have flourished in China during the Qin Dynasty ( 221 BC ) , and in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty .

With these goals, the vanguard of Santa Anna\'s army arrived in San Antonio about 23 February 1836.  Some 145 Texans in the area took refuge in the fortified grounds of an old mission known as the Alamo, under the joint command of William B. Travis (for the regular army) and Jim Bowie (for the volunteers).  Over the following two weeks, the Mexican forces continually strengthened to over 2000 troops.  During the same period, a few reinforcements for the Texans answered Travis\' famous Appeal for Aid and managed to penetrate enemy lines and enter the Alamo grounds, bringing the total strength of the defenders to about 189 men.  After periodic bombardment, the siege ended on the morning of 6 March when the Mexicans storm the Alamo fortress.  During the battle, all of the Texan defenders were killed.  Several non-combatants were spared, including Susanna Dickenson, the wife of one of the defenders, Susanna\'s baby, and a servant of Travis.  Partly to reinforce his goal of terrorizing colonists in Texas, Santa Anna released this small party to inform Texans of the fate of the defenders.  Losses in the battle have been placed at 189 Texans against about 1600 for the Mexicans.  The Alamo - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.comThe Alamo - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com  Google  Early History of the Alamo  Spanish settlers built the Mission San Antonio de Valero, named for St. Anthony of Padua, on the banks of the San Antonio River around 1718. They also established the nearby military garrison of San Antonio de Béxar, which soon became the center of a settlement known as San Fernando de Béxar (later renamed San Antonio). The Mission San Antonio de Valero housed missionaries and their Native American converts for some 70 years until 1793, when Spanish authorities secularized the five missions located in San Antonio and distributed their lands among local residents.  Did You Know?  Ten years after Texas won its independence and shortly after it was annexed by the United States, U.S. soldiers revived the "Remember the Alamo!" battle cry while fighting against Mexican forces in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.  Beginning in the early 1800s, Spanish military troops were stationed in the abandoned chapel of the former mission. Because it stood in a grove of cottonwood trees, the soldiers called their new fort “El Alamo” after the Spanish word for cottonwood and in honor of Alamo de Parras, their hometown in Mexico . Military troops–first Spanish, then rebel and later Mexican–occupied the Alamo during and after Mexico’s successful war for independence from Spain in the early 1820s. In the summer of 1821, Stephen Austin arrived in San Antonio along with some 300 U.S. families that the Spanish government had allowed to settle in Texas . The migration of U.S. citizens to Texas increased over the next decades, sparking a revolutionary movement that would erupt into armed conflict by the mid-1830s.  The Battle of the Alamo  In December 1835, in the early stages of Texas’ war for independence from Mexico, a group of Texan (or Texian) volunteers led by George Collinsworth and Benjamin Milam overwhelmed the Mexican garrison at the Alamo and captured the fort, seizing control of San Antonio. By mid-February 1836, Colonel James Bowie and Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis had taken command of Texan forces in San Antonio. Though Sam Houston , the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Texan forces, argued that San Antonio should be abandoned due to insufficient troop numbers, the Alamo’s defenders–led by Bowie and Travis–dug in nonetheless, prepared to defend the fort to the last.

To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.  Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong .  The 1990 book Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton , while the 1993 movie Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg . Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008. But it all worked out, and the fourth film, titled Jurassic World , was released in 2015. After a highly successful run at the box office, positive reviews, and a resurrection of the franchise in general, a fifth film is to be released on June 22, 2018.

In the Sega Master System game, instead of trying to escape the island, Grant is called to fight and capture the dinosaurs. At the end of the game, he defeats the Tyrannosaurus rex and the park is allowed to open as planned.  Both human female characters in the first film are more capable than their counterparts in the book. In the book, Ellie is mostly passive and stays out of the action; in the film, she is involved just as much as the men around her and even calls out Hammond when he tries to imply he should take a dangerous mission because of her gender.

Published on Jan 2, 2009  One  wonderful  waltz  of   Johann Strauss  Johann Strauss II (October 25, 1825 -- June 3, 1899; also known as fully Johann Baptist Strauss, and Johann Strauss, Jr. was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

Plot summary  Receiving a tip from his dentist Jack Shorter, Inspector Peter Pascoe takes a closer look at the Calliope Kinema Club, a film club notorious for showing adult entertainment movies. Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn\'t suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter\'s concerns are unnecessary. Meanwhile, the "Calli" has been vandalised and its proprietor Gilbert Haggard has been assaulted so badly that he succumbs to a heart attack. The only existing copy of "Droit de Seigneur" - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed, and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her (yet unborn) child, it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the "Calli".  Publication history  *1978, London: Collins Crime Club ISBN 0-00-231643-9, Pub date February 1978, Hardback  Television Adaptation  The novel was adapted for television in 1994 and starred Gareth Hale as Dalziel and Norman Pace as Pascoe. It was shown on the ITV network in three parts over consecutive Saturdays beginning on 9 April. However, Reginald Hill is said to have been unhappy with the series and it subsequently remains the only one to star Hale and Pace in the leading roles. Dalziel and Pascoe was later picked up by the BBC where it enjoyed greater success. Since 1996, 11 series of Dalziel and Pascoe starring Warren Clarke and Colin Buchanan have been made up to 2007.

The wine can be made only in a strictly defined region comprising 14 wine-producing villages in the Troodos foothills about 20 miles (30km) north of the city of Limassol. In 1993, the European Union registered \'Commandaria\' as a protected name and geographical origin.  All Commandaria wines are both sweet and high in alcohol (15–20%). Their sweetness is entirely natural – the result of the high sugar levels wine grapes can achieve in Cyprus\' warm climate, later concentrated by the drying process the grapes undergo before vinification (see passito ). The high alcohol results from an addition of pure grape spirit (see fortification ).  The historic Commandaria wine style dates back to the late 12th century, when Guy de Lusignan was gifted the island by King Richard \'the Lionheart\' of England, who had captured it during the Crusades. De Lusignan fled to Cyprus after he was defeated and run out of Jerusalem. He imposed feudal rule and remained on the island until his death in 1194. The name \'Commandaria\' comes from the Grand Commandery, the feudal land belonging to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, where the original wine-producing vineyards were located.  Commandaria, southern Europe\'s most easterly wine region, has much in common with Oporto , its most westerly (some 2,300 miles away). Both produce sweet, fortified wines; both owe their existence to England\'s historic thirst for rich wine and war; both have had their name and style protected by law; and both are shipped down a river for ageing, to port cities which are the second largest in their respective nations.  One of the clearest differences between Commandaria and port is color: while Commandaria has a deep amber hue which gets darker as the years go by, port is red in its youth and bricks with age. Some Commandaria is made using a solera -style ageing system similar to those used to age sherry in Jerez \xa0(solera\xa0involves blending wine batches from successive years to create consistency of taste). There are even single-vintage cuvees produced in exceptional years.  Both red ( Mavro ) and white ( Xynisteri ) wine grapes are used to make Commandaria. Even today, their vines are generally trained into the traditional bush-vine form that was used before the development of structured trellising. The wine production and the style it produces remain true to the island\'s traditions in almost every regard.  Only a small quantity of Commandaria is made each vintage, so obtaining the wine is significantly more difficult than obtaining its western equivalents port or sherry. This rarity adds to its mystique and helps to maintain its firm ranking among the world\'s classic wines.

Commandaria has a rich history dating back\xa0to Homeric times when it was a popular drink at festivals celebrating the goddess of beauty Aphrodite who emerged from the sea at Paphos in Cyprus - a scene immortalized by Botticelli\'s famous painting, "the Birth of Venus".  A dried grape wine from Cyprus was first known to be described in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod and was known as the Cypriot Manna. Previously it was called "Mana" the Greek word for "Mother". The reason for this is very interesting. The wine was matured in giant earthenware jars. When the time came to pour it out, a certain amount was left in the bottom. When the new wine was added, the old wine helped it to mature. So the old became the mother of the new. It is very likely that the Commandaria you can buy today is the original Cypriot wine enjoyed by the Greek poet Homer and drunk by the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.

The term "cinnamon" also refers to its mid-brown colour. While Cinnamomum verum is sometimes considered to be "true cinnamon", most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from related species, which are also referred to as "cassia" to distinguish them from "true cinnamon".   Cinnamon is the name for perhaps a dozen species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus Cinnamomum in the family Lauraceae. Only a few of them are grown commercially for spice.  Name   The English word "cinnamon", attested in English since the 15th century, derives from the Greek κιννάμωμον kinnámōmon (later kínnamon), via Latin and medieval French intermediate forms. The Greek was borrowed from a Phoenician word, which was akin to the related Hebrew qinnamon.   The name "cassia", first recorded in English around AD 1000, was borrowed via Latin and ultimately derives from Hebrew q\'tsīʿāh, a form of the verb qātsaʿ, "to strip off bark".   Early Modern English also used the names canel and canella, akin to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word cannella, a diminutive of canna, "tube", from the way the bark curls up as it dries.   History   In classical times, four types of cinnamon were distinguished (and often confused):  * True cinnamon , the bark of C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum) from Sri Lanka  * Malabathrum or malobathrum (from Sanskrit तमालपत्रम्,  tamālapattram, literally "dark-tree leaves"), several species including C. tamala from the north of India  * Serichatum, C. cassia from Seres, that is, China  * Cassia (Hebrew קציעה qəṣi`â), the bark of Cinnamomum iners from Arabia and Ethiopia, literally "the peel of the plant" which is scraped off the tree   Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who report it had come from China confuse it with cassia.  Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god; a fine inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of Apollo at Miletus.  Though its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the spice trade, to protect their monopoly as suppliers, cinnamon is native to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Malabar Coast of India, and Burma.  The first Greek reference to kasia is found in a poem by Sappho in the seventh century BC. According to Herodotus, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh, and ladanum, and were guarded by winged serpents. The phoenix was reputed to build its nest from cinnamon and cassia. Herodotus mentions other writers who believed the source of cassia was the home of Dionysos, located somewhere east or south of Greece.  The Greeks used kásia or malabathron to flavour wine, together with absinth wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). While Theophrastus gives a good account of the plants, he describes a curious method for harvesting: worms eat away the wood and leave the bark behind.  Egyptian recipes for kyphi, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia from Hellenistic times onward. The gifts of Hellenistic rulers to temples sometimes included cassia and cinnamon, as well as incense, myrrh, and Indian incense (kostos), so one might conclude that the Greeks used it for similar purposes.  The Hebrew Bible makes specific mention of the spice many times: first when Moses is commanded to use both sweet cinnamon (Hebrew: קִנָּמוֹן, qinnāmôn) and cassia in the holy anointing oil;  in Proverbs where the lover\'s bed is perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon;  and in Song of Solomon, a song describing the beauty of his beloved, cinnamon scents her garments like | Question: Nine tenths of the world\'s Cinnamon is produced on which island nation?

Register Here .  Women in the University  Today, nearly 60 per cent of students studying at the University are women.  The number of women joining the research and academic staff in the University continues to grow and, in recent years, the University has appointed its first female Dean, Vice-Principal, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor.  Yet women have only been permitted to study at Scottish universities since 1892, and Glasgow was the scene of many significant achievements in the campaign for women\'s access to higher education.  Jessie Campbell  The movement for the higher education of women began in earnest in Britain and the United States during the 1840s, but progress was slow in Scotland.  The movement had prominent supporters in the West of Scotland, including the University Principal, John Caird, and in April 1877 they founded the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women.  The Association\'s primary aims were to offer women courses of study similar to those available to men at universities, and "to promote generally the higher culture and education of women" with the co-operation of the University of Glasgow.  The founders of the Association included some of the most influential and wealthy women in the West of Scotland, many of whom sat on its General Committee.  Principal Caird was the first Chairman; the Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria and the Marchioness of Lorne, was President, and Mrs Jessie Campbell of Tulliechewan and Mrs Jane Scott were Vice-Presidents.  Janet Galloway  The Association offered lectures by University professors in class rooms at the University and also (from 1878) at St Andrew\'s Halls.  The lectures were initially in Psychology, Logic, Moral Philosophy, French literature and Astronomy, with others such as Modern Literature and Natural Philosophy added later.  Tutorials were offered in the winter, in Latin, Mathematics and the Theory of Music.  Written examinations were set in all subjects, and essays were required for some, as the Association sought to provide courses of study which replicated those for a University Arts degree.  In the first year, more than 318 women attended classes.  In June 1883 the Association was incorporated under the Companies Act as Queen Margaret College, the first and only college in Scotland to provide higher education for women.  It was named for Margaret (d 1093), the wife of King Malcolm III and a patron of arts and literature, who was canonized in 1250, and its aim was "to perform for women work similar to that done by colleges and universities for men."  The first resident secretary and superintendent was Janet Galloway , who had been an Honorary Secretary to the Association from its inception.  Queen Margaret College  The College was housed in North Park House on the banks of the River Kelvin, a splendid mansion which was purchased and gifted by the Glasgow philanthropist Mrs Isabella Elder .  Lecturers were appointed, many of them from the ranks of the University\'s teaching staff, and classes were offered on a wide range of Arts subjects.  More courses were offered in later years; for example, science laboratories were equipped in 1888 for teaching subjects such as Chemistry and Physics.  Isabella Elder  In response to growing demand from women for access to medical education, a medical school was established within the College in 1890 with laboratories, a dissecting room and all the facilities that would be required for teaching.  Mrs Elder agreed to meet the initial running costs of the school and Glasgow Royal Infirmary set aside beds for the clinical instruction of female medical students.  The women were able to study for licences to practice medicine from the Triple Qualification Board of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons in Scotland and the Universities of London and Dublin.  In February 1892 the Scottish Universities Commissioners published an Ordinance authorising the universities to make provision for the instruction and graduation of women.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.  In June 1992, the High Court of Australia overturned the previous concept of terra nullius which stated that, in legal terms, Australia was empty of inhabitants when it was first settled by Europeans | Question: What is Australia's largest island?", ['tasmania'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3945'), ('Context: The Soviet Union ( Russian : Сове́тский Сою́з , tr .

There are numerous myths and legends surrounding marine mammals. The Greeks believed that killing a dolphin was as bad as murdering a human. An Amazon legend said that river dolphins came to shore dressed as men to woo pretty girls during fiestas. During the Middle Ages, there were numerous legends surrounding the narwhals' amazing tusk, which was thought to have come from the unicorn.  Marine mammals evolved from their land dwelling ancestors over time by developing adaptations to life in the water. To aid swimming, the body has become streamlined and the number of body projections has been reduced. The ears have shrunk to small holes in size and shape. Mammary glands and sex organs are not part of the external physiology, and posterior (hind) limbs are no longer present.  Mechanisms to prevent heat loss have also been developed. The cylindrical body shape with small appendages reduces the surface area to volume ratio of the body, which reduces heat loss. Marine mammals also have a counter current heat exchange mechanism created by convergent evolution where the heat from the arteries is transferred to the veins as they pass each other before getting to extremities, thus reducing heat loss. Some marine mammals also have a thick layer of fur with a water repellent undercoat and/or a thick layer of blubber that can't be compressed. The blubber provides insulation, a food reserve, and aids with buoyancy. These heat loss adaptations can also lead to overheating for animals that spend time out of the water. To prevent overheating, seals or sea lions will swim close to the surface with their front flippers waving in the air. They also flick sand onto themselves to keep the sun from directly hitting their skin. Blood vessels can also be expanded to act as a sort of radiator.  One of the major behavioral adaptations of marine mammals is their ability to swim and dive. Pinnipeds swim by paddling their flippers while sirenians and cetaceans move their tails or flukes up and down.  Some marine mammals can swim at relatively high speeds. Sea lions swim up to 35 kph and orcas can reach 50 kph . The fastest marine mammal, however, is the common dolphin , which reaches speeds up to 64 kph . While swimming, these animals take very quick breaths. For example, fin whales can empty and refill their huge lungs in less than 2 seconds. During dives marine mammals' larynx and esophagus close automatically when they open their mouths to catch prey. Oxygen is stored in hemoglobin in the blood and in myoglobin in the muscles. The lungs are also collapsible so that air is pushed into the windpipe preventing excess nitrogen from being absorbed into the tissues. Decreasing pressure can cause excess nitrogen to expand in the tissues as animals ascend to shallower depths, which can lead to decompression sickness aka “the bends.” Bradycardia, the reduction of heart rate by 10 to 20%, also takes place to aid with slowing respiration during dives and the blood flow to non-essential body parts. These adaptations allow sea otters to stay submerged for 4 to 5 minutes and dive to depths up to 55 m . Pinnipeds can often stay down for 30 minutes and reach average depths of 150- 250 m . One marine mammal with exceptional diving skills is the Weddell seal , which can stay submerged for at least 73 minutes at a time at depths up to 600 m . The length and depth of whale dives depends on the species. Baleen whales feed on plankton near the surface of the water and have no need to dive deeply so they are rarely seen diving deeper than 100 m . Toothed whales seek larger prey at deeper depths and some can stay down for hours at depths of up to 2,250 m .  Marine mammals are often very social animals. Dolphins travel in pods (schools) and catch rides on the bow waves of boats.

Plot summary  Receiving a tip from his dentist Jack Shorter, Inspector Peter Pascoe takes a closer look at the Calliope Kinema Club, a film club notorious for showing adult entertainment movies. Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn\'t suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter\'s concerns are unnecessary.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

The wine can be made only in a strictly defined region comprising 14 wine-producing villages in the Troodos foothills about 20 miles (30km) north of the city of Limassol. In 1993, the European Union registered \'Commandaria\' as a protected name and geographical origin.  All Commandaria wines are both sweet and high in alcohol (15–20%). Their sweetness is entirely natural – the result of the high sugar levels wine grapes can achieve in Cyprus\' warm climate, later concentrated by the drying process the grapes undergo before vinification (see passito ). The high alcohol results from an addition of pure grape spirit (see fortification ).  The historic Commandaria wine style dates back to the late 12th century, when Guy de Lusignan was gifted the island by King Richard \'the Lionheart\' of England, who had captured it during the Crusades. De Lusignan fled to Cyprus after he was defeated and run out of Jerusalem. He imposed feudal rule and remained on the island until his death in 1194. The name \'Commandaria\' comes from the Grand Commandery, the feudal land belonging to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, where the original wine-producing vineyards were located.  Commandaria, southern Europe\'s most easterly wine region, has much in common with Oporto , its most westerly (some 2,300 miles away). Both produce sweet, fortified wines; both owe their existence to England\'s historic thirst for rich wine and war; both have had their name and style protected by law; and both are shipped down a river for ageing, to port cities which are the second largest in their respective nations.  One of the clearest differences between Commandaria and port is color: while Commandaria has a deep amber hue which gets darker as the years go by, port is red in its youth and bricks with age. Some Commandaria is made using a solera -style ageing system similar to those used to age sherry in Jerez \xa0(solera\xa0involves blending wine batches from successive years to create consistency of taste). There are even single-vintage cuvees produced in exceptional years.  Both red ( Mavro ) and white ( Xynisteri ) wine grapes are used to make Commandaria. Even today, their vines are generally trained into the traditional bush-vine form that was used before the development of structured trellising. The wine production and the style it produces remain true to the island\'s traditions in almost every regard.  Only a small quantity of Commandaria is made each vintage, so obtaining the wine is significantly more difficult than obtaining its western equivalents port or sherry. This rarity adds to its mystique and helps to maintain its firm ranking among the world\'s classic wines.

A dried grape wine from Cyprus was first known to be described in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod and was known as the Cypriot Manna. Previously it was called "Mana" the Greek word for "Mother". The reason for this is very interesting. The wine was matured in giant earthenware jars. When the time came to pour it out, a certain amount was left in the bottom. When the new wine was added, the old wine helped it to mature. So the old became the mother of the new.

The term "cinnamon" also refers to its mid-brown colour. While Cinnamomum verum is sometimes considered to be "true cinnamon", most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from related species, which are also referred to as "cassia" to distinguish them from "true cinnamon".   Cinnamon is the name for perhaps a dozen species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus Cinnamomum in the family Lauraceae. Only a few of them are grown commercially for spice.  Name   The English word "cinnamon", attested in English since the 15th century, derives from the Greek κιννάμωμον kinnámōmon (later kínnamon), via Latin and medieval French intermediate forms. The Greek was borrowed from a Phoenician word, which was akin to the related Hebrew qinnamon.   The name "cassia", first recorded in English around AD 1000, was borrowed via Latin and ultimately derives from Hebrew q\'tsīʿāh, a form of the verb qātsaʿ, "to strip off bark".   Early Modern English also used the names canel and canella, akin to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word cannella, a diminutive of canna, "tube", from the way the bark curls up as it dries.   History   In classical times, four types of cinnamon were distinguished (and often confused):  * True cinnamon , the bark of C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum) from Sri Lanka  * Malabathrum or malobathrum (from Sanskrit तमालपत्रम्,  tamālapattram, literally "dark-tree leaves"), several species including C. tamala from the north of India  * Serichatum, C. cassia from Seres, that is, China  * Cassia (Hebrew קציעה qəṣi`â), the bark of Cinnamomum iners from Arabia and Ethiopia, literally "the peel of the plant" which is scraped off the tree   Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who report it had come from China confuse it with cassia.  Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god; a fine inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of Apollo at Miletus.  Though its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the spice trade, to protect their monopoly as suppliers, cinnamon is native to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Malabar Coast of India, and Burma.  The first Greek reference to kasia is found in a poem by Sappho in the seventh century BC. According to Herodotus, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh, and ladanum, and were guarded by winged serpents. The phoenix was reputed to build its nest from cinnamon and cassia. Herodotus mentions other writers who believed the source of cassia was the home of Dionysos, located somewhere east or south of Greece.  The Greeks used kásia or malabathron to flavour wine, together with absinth wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). While Theophrastus gives a good account of the plants, he describes a curious method for harvesting: worms eat away the wood and leave the bark behind.  Egyptian recipes for kyphi, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia from Hellenistic times onward.

Register Here .  Women in the University  Today, nearly 60 per cent of students studying at the University are women.  The number of women joining the research and academic staff in the University continues to grow and, in recent years, the University has appointed its first female Dean, Vice-Principal, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor.  Yet women have only been permitted to study at Scottish universities since 1892, and Glasgow was the scene of many significant achievements in the campaign for women\'s access to higher education.  Jessie Campbell  The movement for the higher education of women began in earnest in Britain and the United States during the 1840s, but progress was slow in Scotland.  The movement had prominent supporters in the West of Scotland, including the University Principal, John Caird, and in April 1877 they founded the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women.  The Association\'s primary aims were to offer women courses of study similar to those available to men at universities, and "to promote generally the higher culture and education of women" with the co-operation of the University of Glasgow.  The founders of the Association included some of the most influential and wealthy women in the West of Scotland, many of whom sat on its General Committee.  Principal Caird was the first Chairman; the Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria and the Marchioness of Lorne, was President, and Mrs Jessie Campbell of Tulliechewan and Mrs Jane Scott were Vice-Presidents.  Janet Galloway  The Association offered lectures by University professors in class rooms at the University and also (from 1878) at St Andrew\'s Halls.  The lectures were initially in Psychology, Logic, Moral Philosophy, French literature and Astronomy, with others such as Modern Literature and Natural Philosophy added later.  Tutorials were offered in the winter, in Latin, Mathematics and the Theory of Music.  Written examinations were set in all subjects, and essays were required for some, as the Association sought to provide courses of study which replicated those for a University Arts degree.  In the first year, more than 318 women attended classes.  In June 1883 the Association was incorporated under the Companies Act as Queen Margaret College, the first and only college in Scotland to provide higher education for women.  It was named for Margaret (d 1093), the wife of King Malcolm III and a patron of arts and literature, who was canonized in 1250, and its aim was "to perform for women work similar to that done by colleges and universities for men."  The first resident secretary and superintendent was Janet Galloway , who had been an Honorary Secretary to the Association from its inception.  Queen Margaret College  The College was housed in North Park House on the banks of the River Kelvin, a splendid mansion which was purchased and gifted by the Glasgow philanthropist Mrs Isabella Elder .  Lecturers were appointed, many of them from the ranks of the University\'s teaching staff, and classes were offered on a wide range of Arts subjects.  More courses were offered in later years; for example, science laboratories were equipped in 1888 for teaching subjects such as Chemistry and Physics.  Isabella Elder  In response to growing demand from women for access to medical education, a medical school was established within the College in 1890 with laboratories, a dissecting room and all the facilities that would be required for teaching.  Mrs Elder agreed to meet the initial running costs of the school and Glasgow Royal Infirmary set aside beds for the clinical instruction of female medical students.  The women were able to study for licences to practice medicine from the Triple Qualification Board of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons in Scotland and the Universities of London and Dublin.  In February 1892 the Scottish Universities Commissioners published an Ordinance authorising the universities to make provision for the instruction and graduation of women.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.  In June 1992, the High Court of Australia overturned the previous concept of terra nullius which stated that, in legal terms, Australia was empty of inhabitants when it was first settled by Europeans | Question: What is Australia's largest island?", ['tasmania'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3945'), ('Context: The Soviet Union ( Russian : Сове́тский Сою́з , tr .

There are numerous myths and legends surrounding marine mammals. The Greeks believed that killing a dolphin was as bad as murdering a human. An Amazon legend said that river dolphins came to shore dressed as men to woo pretty girls during fiestas. During the Middle Ages, there were numerous legends surrounding the narwhals' amazing tusk, which was thought to have come from the unicorn.  Marine mammals evolved from their land dwelling ancestors over time by developing adaptations to life in the water. To aid swimming, the body has become streamlined and the number of body projections has been reduced. The ears have shrunk to small holes in size and shape. Mammary glands and sex organs are not part of the external physiology, and posterior (hind) limbs are no longer present.  Mechanisms to prevent heat loss have also been developed. The cylindrical body shape with small appendages reduces the surface area to volume ratio of the body, which reduces heat loss. Marine mammals also have a counter current heat exchange mechanism created by convergent evolution where the heat from the arteries is transferred to the veins as they pass each other before getting to extremities, thus reducing heat loss. Some marine mammals also have a thick layer of fur with a water repellent undercoat and/or a thick layer of blubber that can't be compressed. The blubber provides insulation, a food reserve, and aids with buoyancy. These heat loss adaptations can also lead to overheating for animals that spend time out of the water. To prevent overheating, seals or sea lions will swim close to the surface with their front flippers waving in the air. They also flick sand onto themselves to keep the sun from directly hitting their skin. Blood vessels can also be expanded to act as a sort of radiator.  One of the major behavioral adaptations of marine mammals is their ability to swim and dive. Pinnipeds swim by paddling their flippers while sirenians and cetaceans move their tails or flukes up and down.  Some marine mammals can swim at relatively high speeds. Sea lions swim up to 35 kph and orcas can reach 50 kph . The fastest marine mammal, however, is the common dolphin , which reaches speeds up to 64 kph . While swimming, these animals take very quick breaths. For example, fin whales can empty and refill their huge lungs in less than 2 seconds. During dives marine mammals' larynx and esophagus close automatically when they open their mouths to catch prey. Oxygen is stored in hemoglobin in the blood and in myoglobin in the muscles. The lungs are also collapsible so that air is pushed into the windpipe preventing excess nitrogen from being absorbed into the tissues. Decreasing pressure can cause excess nitrogen to expand in the tissues as animals ascend to shallower depths, which can lead to decompression sickness aka “the bends.” Bradycardia, the reduction of heart rate by 10 to 20%, also takes place to aid with slowing respiration during dives and the blood flow to non-essential body parts. These adaptations allow sea otters to stay submerged for 4 to 5 minutes and dive to depths up to 55 m . Pinnipeds can often stay down for 30 minutes and reach average depths of 150- 250 m . One marine mammal with exceptional diving skills is the Weddell seal , which can stay submerged for at least 73 minutes at a time at depths up to 600 m . The length and depth of whale dives depends on the species. Baleen whales feed on plankton near the surface of the water and have no need to dive deeply so they are rarely seen diving deeper than 100 m . Toothed whales seek larger prey at deeper depths and some can stay down for hours at depths of up to 2,250 m .  Marine mammals are often very social animals. Dolphins travel in pods (schools) and catch rides on the bow waves of boats.

Plot summary  Receiving a tip from his dentist Jack Shorter, Inspector Peter Pascoe takes a closer look at the Calliope Kinema Club, a film club notorious for showing adult entertainment movies. Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn\'t suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter\'s concerns are unnecessary. Meanwhile, the "Calli" has been vandalised and its proprietor Gilbert Haggard has been assaulted so badly that he succumbs to a heart attack. The only existing copy of "Droit de Seigneur" - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed, and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her (yet unborn) child, it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the "Calli".

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

The sailors in the German Navy mutinied and set up councils based on the soviets in Russia. By 6th November the revolution had spread to the Western Front and all major cities and ports in Germany.On 7th November, 1918, Kurt Eisner, leader of the Independent Socialist Party, declared Bavaria a Socialist Republic. Eisner made it clear that this revolution was different from the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and announced that all private property would be protected by the new government.On 9th November, 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and the Chancellor, Max von Baden, handed power over to Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the German Social Democrat Party.In Bavaia Kurt Eisner formed a coalition with the German Social Democrat Party in the National Assembly. Eisner\'s rule was short-lived as he was assassinated by Anton Graf Arco, a fanatical nationalist, on 21st February, 1919.

Levine, like the Bolsheviks had done in Russia, established Red Guard units to defend the revolution.In January, 1919, the Spartakist Rising, led by Rosa Luxemburg, Leo Jogiches, Clara Zetkin and Karl Liebknecht took place in Berlin.Friedrich Ebert now saw his own power under threat and called in the German Army and the Freikorps to bring an end to the rebellion. By 13th January the rebellion had been crushed and its leaders, including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches had been captured and executed.With Freikorps units massing on Bavaria\'s northern borders, the Red Guards began arresting people they considered to be hostile to the new regime. On 29th April, 1919, eight men were executed after being found guilty of being right-wing spies.Friedrich Ebert, the Chancellor of Germany, now ordered the German Army and the Freikorps into Bavaria. They quickly gained control and over the next few weeks an estimate 700 men and women were captured and executed. Eugen Levine was arrested and after being found guilty of being involved in the execution of the eight spies, was shot by a firing squad.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

The shamisen had many forms before it arrived to Japan, though it’s unclear where it originated from. It is said that a three stringed lute arrived in China during the later years of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). This instrument is called the sanxian. Trade flourished between China and the Ryukyu kingdom (Okinawa). Many instruments were brought over, including their sanxian, now called the Okinawan Sanshin. It is said to have been brought over by merchants from Fukien in 1392, a time when there was considerable immigration from southern China.  The Sanxian  Now we come to it’s arrival to Japan. It’s generally said that the sanshin came to Japan in 1562, in the city of Sakai (a port city south of Osaka). It’s assumed to have come from Okinawa, though with all the trade that was happening with China, direct importation was by no means out of the question. There probably were Chinese sanxian in Japan before 1562, but not in significant enough numbers to start anything. The Okinawan sanshin is what caused the shamisen to be taken up by the Japanese.  Soon after, biwa players took up the sanshin (now called the shamisen) so they could be better heard on the street. And being the first players of the instrument in Japan, they could do what they wanted with it! And do they did.  Kusakabe Kimbei - Geshia Playing Shamisen  The shamisen is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the shamisen is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the dō , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The sao, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.  The three strings are traditionally made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or ‘tetron’ strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.  Shamisen maker with a customer  The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as nagauta, or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and bunraku. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.  The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is gidayū, named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the bunraku puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The gidayū shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action.

The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions.

By 6th November the revolution had spread to the Western Front and all major cities and ports in Germany.On 7th November, 1918, Kurt Eisner, leader of the Independent Socialist Party, declared Bavaria a Socialist Republic. Eisner made it clear that this revolution was different from the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and announced that all private property would be protected by the new government.On 9th November, 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and the Chancellor, Max von Baden, handed power over to Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the German Social Democrat Party.In Bavaia Kurt Eisner formed a coalition with the German Social Democrat Party in the National Assembly. Eisner\'s rule was short-lived as he was assassinated by Anton Graf Arco, a fanatical nationalist, on 21st February, 1919.  Fearing a counter-revolution, supporters of Eisner established Soldiers\' and Workers\' Councils and took over the government from the National Assembly.

Factories were to be run by joint councils of workers and owners and workers\' control of industry and plans were made to abolish paper money. Levine, like the Bolsheviks had done in Russia, established Red Guard units to defend the revolution.In January, 1919, the Spartakist Rising, led by Rosa Luxemburg, Leo Jogiches, Clara Zetkin and Karl Liebknecht took place in Berlin.Friedrich Ebert now saw his own power under threat and called in the German Army and the Freikorps to bring an end to the rebellion. By 13th January the rebellion had been crushed and its leaders, including Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches had been captured and executed.With Freikorps units massing on Bavaria\'s northern borders, the Red Guards began arresting people they considered to be hostile to the new regime.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of "Social Darwinism" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

The shamisen had many forms before it arrived to Japan, though it’s unclear where it originated from. It is said that a three stringed lute arrived in China during the later years of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). This instrument is called the sanxian. Trade flourished between China and the Ryukyu kingdom (Okinawa). Many instruments were brought over, including their sanxian, now called the Okinawan Sanshin. It is said to have been brought over by merchants from Fukien in 1392, a time when there was considerable immigration from southern China.  The Sanxian  Now we come to it’s arrival to Japan. It’s generally said that the sanshin came to Japan in 1562, in the city of Sakai (a port city south of Osaka). It’s assumed to have come from Okinawa, though with all the trade that was happening with China, direct importation was by no means out of the question. There probably were Chinese sanxian in Japan before 1562, but not in significant enough numbers to start anything. The Okinawan sanshin is what caused the shamisen to be taken up by the Japanese.  Soon after, biwa players took up the sanshin (now called the shamisen) so they could be better heard on the street. And being the first players of the instrument in Japan, they could do what they wanted with it! And do they did.  Kusakabe Kimbei - Geshia Playing Shamisen  The shamisen is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the shamisen is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the dō , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The sao, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.  The three strings are traditionally made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or ‘tetron’ strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.  Shamisen maker with a customer  The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as nagauta, or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and bunraku. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.  The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is gidayū, named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the bunraku puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The gidayū shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. From the 19th century female performers known as onna-jōruri or onna gidayū also carried on this concert tradition.

The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. At any moment in time many individual lattice atoms will be away from their perfect lattice sites and this interferes with electron movement.  When the temperature coefficient is known, an adjusted resistivity value can be computed using the following formula:  R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1–T2)]  Where: R1 = resistivity value adjusted | Question: What electrical property, the reciprocal of resistivity, has the SI units Siemens per metre?', ['conductivity'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4196'), ('Context: Maududi also believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia, and Islam required the establishment of an Islamic state.

It proved to be successful in the U.S., peaking at the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, at #5. The single also peaked at #60 on the UK Singles Chart. Hit songs "This Is the Way We Roll" and "2 Legit 2 Quit" were performed by Hammer on Saturday Night Live. Along with "Addams Groove", and other songs, "2 Legit 2 Quit" was featured in the film, The Addams Family in 1991.  In March 2003, MC Hammer released a version of the song featuring Saja.   On October 2 (televised October 12), Hammer opened the 2010 BET Hip Hop Awards performing "2 Legit 2 Quit" in Atlanta along with Rick Ross, Diddy and DJ Khaled (performing "MC Hammer" from the Teflon Don album).     At the 40th American Music Awards in November 2012, Hammer danced to "Gangnam Style" and "2 Legit 2 Quit" alongside Psy, both wearing his signature Hammer pants.   The performance idea for the collaboration with Hammer came from Psy\'s manager.  The mashup was later released on iTunes.  They both performed it together again on December 31, 2012 during Dick Clark\'s New Year\'s Rockin\' Eve.

It then cuts to an impatient crowd waiting for Hammer to perform, while Hammer has a lengthy conversation with James Brown, who calls Hammer "Godson" and enlists him to get the glove of Michael Jackson. Brown endows Hammer with several blasts of energy, before sending Hammer off to perform. The performance is high budget and laden with impressive pyrotechnics.

Hammer personally spoke with Jackson on the phone about the video, with Jackson giving his approval of it.   The song\'s music video features several athletes making cameo appearances.

Each of these was associated with a season--Boreas was the cold breath of winter, Zephyros the god of spring breezes, and Notos the god of summer rain-storms.  The Winds were portrayed as either man-shaped, winged gods who lived together in a cavern on Mount Haimos (Haemus) in Thrake (Thrace), or as horse-shaped divinities stabled by Aiolos (Aeolus) Hippotades, "the Reiner of  Horses", on the island of Aiolia and set out to graze on the shores of the earth-encircling River Okeanos (Oceanus).  Early poets, such as Homer and Hesiod, drew a clear distinction between the four, relatively benign, seasonal Winds (Anemoi)  and the destructive Storm-Winds ( Anemoi Thuellai ). The latter, spawned by the monster Typhoeus, were either housed in the caverns of Aiolos or guarded by the Hekatonkheires in the pits of Tartaros . Later authors blurred the distinction between the two.  The female counterparts of the Anemoi were the Aellai Harpyiai (Harpies). Mated with the Winds they produced many  swift, immortal horses.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml .

Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Despite being one of the most historically significant sites of Thailand’s modern history, the large congregation of yellow and white buildings along the Chao Praya River in Bangkok which make up the Thammasat University would not strike the casual observer as anything particularly interesting. Nonetheless, the events which transpired here between 1973 and 1976 not only led to the creation of Thailand’s current pseudo-parliamentary democracy, but also give testimony to how those in power have used violence and intimidation as a means of keeping the country socially and politically conservative.  Between 1968 and 1973, hundreds of thousands of students, supported by workers, businesspeople and many ordinary citizens, took part in protests against the military dictatorship of Thanom Kittikachorn . On October 14, 1973 , police opened fire on a large student demonstration. As the military sent troops, tanks and helicopters to Thammasat University, students reportedly commandeered buses and fire trucks in order to use them as battering rams against the tanks. Students fleeing the university campus were shot by military troops while students who remained inside were fired upon by helicopters. It was this atrocity and the following popular outrage which led King Bhumibol to oust the dictator Thanom and replace him with Sanya Dharmasakti, the head chancellor of Thammasat University, as the new Prime Minister of the country.  Under this new government, the political scene remained unstable, as the installment of communist regimes in neighboring Vietnam and Laos — in addition to large general strikes at home — fed fears of the ruling elite that left-wing activists were setting the stage for a communist takeover. These fears were exacerbated by the conservative media controlled by elements within the military. In response, the military started to train tens of thousands of right-wing militias in advanced military drills and combat skills. Subsequently, the royal family invited the former dictator Thanom back from his exile in Singapore, in preparation for a military coup against the government which they saw as being too weak on leftist agitators.  Student Massacre  On October 5, 1976, students and trade unionists occupied Thammasat University to protest against Thanom’s return to the country. The conservative media at the time falsely claimed that the protesters had hanged an effigy of the royal prince, sparking outrage amongst the militias which enjoyed the backing of the royalty. Early the next morning, on October 6, the university was surrounded by thousands of military, police, and militia members. The gates to the occupied university were broken down and the ensuing massacre which followed has been described as a “wild outbreak of kicking, clubbing, shooting, and lynching.” Students were hung, tortured and raped, bodies were burned, and those who jumped into the river, trying to escape, were shot by naval vassals. Following the three-hour long carnage, where over a hundred students were reportedly killed, the military ousted the government to ‘protect the monarchy’, effectively putting the country under martial law.  The aftermath of the massacre forced leftist activists underground as the new royally appointed reactionary Prime Minister Tanin Kraivichien rounded up thousands of suspected leftists, censored the media and made joining a communist organization punishable by death. Even today, decades after the transition to a pseudo-parliamentary democracy, the government still imprisons those who criticize the country’s most undemocratic institution, the monarchy. As a result, the political arena lacks any sort of true egalitarian representation and instead fluctuates from moderate right to extreme right.  Thaksin’s Rise and Fall  In 2001, after years of dictatorship, Thaksin Shinawatra, a business tycoon who made his fortune in the telecommunication industry, was elected Prime Minister of Thailand. His political party, the populist Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais, TRT) party, attempted to address the country’s rampant economic poverty with regulated capitalism. The reforms implemented by Thaksin, when compared to the previous line of ultra-conservative dictators, made him seem like the most progressive politician on the scene, despite his pro-business, authoritarian agenda.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074')]

Hit songs "This Is the Way We Roll" and "2 Legit 2 Quit" were performed by Hammer on Saturday Night Live. Along with "Addams Groove", and other songs, "2 Legit 2 Quit" was featured in the film, The Addams Family in 1991.  In March 2003, MC Hammer released a version of the song featuring Saja.   On October 2 (televised October 12), Hammer opened the 2010 BET Hip Hop Awards performing "2 Legit 2 Quit" in Atlanta along with Rick Ross, Diddy and DJ Khaled (performing "MC Hammer" from the Teflon Don album).

Each of these was associated with a season--Boreas was the cold breath of winter, Zephyros the god of spring breezes, and Notos the god of summer rain-storms.  The Winds were portrayed as either man-shaped, winged gods who lived together in a cavern on Mount Haimos (Haemus) in Thrake (Thrace), or as horse-shaped divinities stabled by Aiolos (Aeolus) Hippotades, "the Reiner of  Horses", on the island of Aiolia and set out to graze on the shores of the earth-encircling River Okeanos (Oceanus).  Early poets, such as Homer and Hesiod, drew a clear distinction between the four, relatively benign, seasonal Winds (Anemoi)  and the destructive Storm-Winds ( Anemoi Thuellai ). The latter, spawned by the monster Typhoeus, were either housed in the caverns of Aiolos or guarded by the Hekatonkheires in the pits of Tartaros .

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants.

Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Despite being one of the most historically significant sites of Thailand’s modern history, the large congregation of yellow and white buildings along the Chao Praya River in Bangkok which make up the Thammasat University would not strike the casual observer as anything particularly interesting. Nonetheless, the events which transpired here between 1973 and 1976 not only led to the creation of Thailand’s current pseudo-parliamentary democracy, but also give testimony to how those in power have used violence and intimidation as a means of keeping the country socially and politically conservative.  Between 1968 and 1973, hundreds of thousands of students, supported by workers, businesspeople and many ordinary citizens, took part in protests against the military dictatorship of Thanom Kittikachorn . On October 14, 1973 , police opened fire on a large student demonstration. As the military sent troops, tanks and helicopters to Thammasat University, students reportedly commandeered buses and fire trucks in order to use them as battering rams against the tanks. Students fleeing the university campus were shot by military troops while students who remained inside were fired upon by helicopters. It was this atrocity and the following popular outrage which led King Bhumibol to oust the dictator Thanom and replace him with Sanya Dharmasakti, the head chancellor of Thammasat University, as the new Prime Minister of the country.  Under this new government, the political scene remained unstable, as the installment of communist regimes in neighboring Vietnam and Laos — in addition to large general strikes at home — fed fears of the ruling elite that left-wing activists were setting the stage for a communist takeover. These fears were exacerbated by the conservative media controlled by elements within the military. In response, the military started to train tens of thousands of right-wing militias in advanced military drills and combat skills. Subsequently, the royal family invited the former dictator Thanom back from his exile in Singapore, in preparation for a military coup against the government which they saw as being too weak on leftist agitators.  Student Massacre  On October 5, 1976, students and trade unionists occupied Thammasat University to protest against Thanom’s return to the country. The conservative media at the time falsely claimed that the protesters had hanged an effigy of the royal prince, sparking outrage amongst the militias which enjoyed the backing of the royalty. Early the next morning, on October 6, the university was surrounded by thousands of military, police, and militia members. The gates to the occupied university were broken down and the ensuing massacre which followed has been described as a “wild outbreak of kicking, clubbing, shooting, and lynching.” Students were hung, tortured and raped, bodies were burned, and those who jumped into the river, trying to escape, were shot by naval vassals. Following the three-hour long carnage, where over a hundred students were reportedly killed, the military ousted the government to ‘protect the monarchy’, effectively putting the country under martial law.  The aftermath of the massacre forced leftist activists underground as the new royally appointed reactionary Prime Minister Tanin Kraivichien rounded up thousands of suspected leftists, censored the media and made joining a communist organization punishable by death. Even today, decades after the transition to a pseudo-parliamentary democracy, the government still imprisons those who criticize the country’s most undemocratic institution, the monarchy. As a result, the political arena lacks any sort of true egalitarian representation and instead fluctuates from moderate right to extreme right.  Thaksin’s Rise and Fall  In 2001, after years of dictatorship, Thaksin Shinawatra, a business tycoon who made his fortune in the telecommunication industry, was elected Prime Minister of Thailand. His political party, the populist Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais, TRT) party, attempted to address the country’s rampant economic poverty with regulated capitalism. The reforms implemented by Thaksin, when compared to the previous line of ultra-conservative dictators, made him seem like the most progressive politician on the scene, despite his pro-business, authoritarian agenda.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

They think it\'s all over - it is now!"

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074')]

It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George\'s Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan.  While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern ("New Pomerania").  Geography  New Britain extends from 148°18\'31" to 152°23\'57" E longitude and from 4°08\'25" to 6°18\'31" S latitude. It is crescent-shaped, approximately 520 km along its southeastern coastline, and from 29 to 146\xa0km (18–91\xa0miles) wide, not including a small central peninsula. The air-line distance from west to east is 477 km. The island is the 38th largest in the world, with an area of .  Steep cliffs form some sections of the coastline; in others the mountains are further inland, and the coastal area is flat and bordered by coral reefs. The highest point, at 2,438\xa0m (7,999\xa0ft), is Mount Sinewit in the Baining range in the east. Most of the terrain is covered with tropical rainforest and several large rivers are fed by the high rainfall.  New Britain was largely formed by volcanic processes, and there are several active volcanoes on the island, including Ulawun (the highest volcano in Papua New Guinea), Langila, the Garbuna Group, the Sulu Range, and the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan of the Rabaul caldera. A major eruption of Tavurvur in 1994 destroyed the East New Britain provincial capital of Rabaul. Most of the town still lies under metres of ash, and the capital has been moved to nearby Kokopo.  Administrative divisions  New Britain forms part of the Islands Region, one of four regions of Papua New Guinea. It comprises the mainland of two provinces:  * East New Britain with headquarters in Kokopo (formerly Rabaul)  * West New Britain with headquarters in Kimbe  Modern history   For the missionary history, see Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Solomon Islands  1700–1914  William Dampier became the first known European to visit New Britain on 27 February 1700: he dubbed the island with the Latin name Nova Britannia, (Eng: New Britain).  In November 1884, Germany proclaimed its protectorate over the New Britain Archipelago; the German colonial administration gave New Britain and New Ireland the names of Neupommern (or Neu-Pommern; "New Pomerania") and Neumecklenburg (or Neu-Mecklenburg; "New Mecklenburg") respectively, and the whole island group was renamed the Bismarck Archipelago. New Britain became part of German New Guinea.  In 1909, the indigenous population was estimated at about 190,000; the foreign population at 773 (474 white). The expatriate population was practically confined to the northeastern Gazelle Peninsula, which included the capital, Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo). At the time 5,448 hectares (13,464 acres) had been converted to plantations, primarily growing copra, cotton, coffee and rubber. Westerners avoided exploring the interior initially, believing that the indigenous peoples were warlike and would fiercely resist intrusions.  World War I  On 11 September 1914, New Britain became the site of one of the earliest battles of World War I when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island. They quickly overwhelmed the German forces and occupied the island for the duration of the war.  Between the world wars  After World War I the Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919, where Germany was stripped on all its possessions outside Europe. In 1920 the League of Nations included New Britain along with the former German colony on New Guinea in the Territory of New Guinea, a mandated territory of Australia.  World War II  During World War II the Japanese attacked New Britain soon after the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean.

This film adaptation was directed by David Fincher and written by Steven Zaillian. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.  Blomkvist breaks into Martin\'s house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV.

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings. On the first Friday of each month, crowds of locals and visitors head to the First Friday Gallery Hop at Railroad Square, a former lumber yard in downtown Tallahassee that is now home to over 50 eclectic shops, galleries and art studios.

But, asks Ed Caesar, will New Rupert draw the kids?  Monday 6 November 2006 00:00 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  Rupert, it seems, will bear anything. Over nine decades, the Daily Express stalwart has withstood changes of fur colour, allegations of racism, and a lurid sex scandal. He even survived the recent jobs cull at Express Newspapers (although, because of "restructuring", he may have started subbing the arts pages and filing a sports column). Now, Rupert Bear, as all public figures eventually must, has one more obstacle to overcome: re-branding.  On Wednesday, exactly 86 years after he began life on what was then Britain\'s best-selling newspaper, a jazzed-up Rupert will appear on Five, in a new children\'s programme called Rupert Bear - Follow the Magic. Although Rupert is ostensibly unchanged, he has a whole new outlook on life. He runs. He jumps. He rides a scooter. He helps to clean up the environment in his bucolic fictional home, Nutwood.  Despite a number of scare stories circulated in the nationals last week, the new Rupert does not wear a hoodie. Nor does he refer to his friends as "blud" and "homie". Indeed, Rupert looks, at first glance, unchanged. The garish yellow check trousers and red jumper remain (although Rupert now sports snazzy red trainers instead of boots.) And, following the old maxim that you can tell a bear by the company he keeps, Rupert is seeing less of his old boys, like Algy Pug, preferring to hang out with diverse, funky cats like Ping Pong, a feisty five-year-old girl with magic powers, and Miranda the Mermaid.  It sounds suspiciously like Rupert has employed the same re-invention gurus as David Cameron\'s Conservatives. In fact, he is using Entertainment Rights, Britain\'s leading children\'s intellectual property owners. Their last major success was to re-work Postman Pat from a cat-owning loner into a snowboarding family man. So will Rupert be snowboarding, or is he just another tweed-wearing Tory in disguise?  "Rupert won\'t be snowboarding," says Jane Smith, commercial director for Entertainment Rights, "unless, of course, it snows in Nutwood. The thing about Rupert is that he\'s 86 years old. So there\'s a huge heritage there. We\'ve tried to make him into a pre-school character, and he\'s never been one before. So we\'ve had to make him more exciting for today\'s kids."  Does that mean the gentle, pottering Rupert of old - a bear for whom a treasure hunt was the pinnacle of adventure - is gone?  "Absolutely not," says Smith. "We\'re going to operate a dual-brand strategy. We\'re keeping Classic Rupert, which will be a much more adult, collectible type of brand [Royal Doulton are creating a new Rupert range]. And then we\'re developing New Rupert for children\'s television. Classic Rupert will still appear in the Express, and The Rupert Annual."  Over the years, "Classic Rupert" has had a bumpy ride. Conceived in November 1920 by Mary Tourtel as a brown-furred bear, Rupert started life in the Daily Express with two cartoons a day, and a short story underneath. The penny-pinchers at the Express, though, quickly realised that white was much cheaper to print than brown, and Rupert\'s colour soon changed (although in the Netherlands he is still known as "Rupert Brown Bear").  When Tourtel\'s eyesight deteriorated in 1935, a Punch illustrator called Alfred Bestall was asked to fill in for six weeks.

His brother was Richard Ainley (1910-1967) and his father Henry Ainley (1879-1945). He worked in the theatre for many years and eventually found work in various historical film dramas in the 1970s. However, his claim to fame is in the casting in the role of the Master in the long running science fiction series, "Doctor Who" (1963). He joined the team in 1980, appearing in at least one of every six episodes per year until 1986 - when his contract expired. However, he did reprise the role for the final Doctor Who episode entitled \'Survival\' - where the Master was supposedly killed off. He retired from acting professionally in the late nineties and played cricket up until the time of his death in May 2004.  TRIVIA:  He was a keen cricketer for many years.  By the mid-eighties, he had come into some money that allowed him to live a comfortable life without acting.  He was the fourth actor to portray the Master in "Doctor Who" (1963). The character had previously been played by \'Roger Delgado\' (qv), \'Peter Pratt\' (qv) and \'Geoffrey Beevers\' (qv).  He played the Master in \'Doctor Who\' for nine years - the longest serving actor to appear as a regular character in the TV series\' history.  He was on the shortlist for Prof Watson (played by Glyn Houston) in Doctor Who: The Hand of Fear.  Just as his Doctor Who character "The Master" would use anagrams to conceal his identity, Ainley would be credited with an anagram of his own name to hide the fact that a character he was playing in certain episodes was The Master in Disguise. Most notably, this led to his credit in "Castrovalva" episode 3 being "Neil Toynay" (Tony Ainley).  After \'Roger Delgado\' (qv), \'Peter Pratt\' (qv) and \'Geoffrey Beevers\' (qv), he was the fourth actor to play the Master, the Doctor\'s greatest enemy, in _"Doctor Who" (1963)_ (qv). He played the role from the 1981 serial "The Keeper of Traken" to the 1989 serial "Survival". He is the longest running Master. He was succeeded in the role by \'Gordon Tipple\' (qv), \'Eric Roberts (I)\' (qv), Sir \'Derek Jacobi\' (qv) and \'John Simm\' (qv).  He despised cheeses of all kinds.

It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George\'s Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan.  While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern ("New Pomerania").  Geography  New Britain extends from 148°18\'31" to 152°23\'57" E longitude and from 4°08\'25" to 6°18\'31" S latitude. It is crescent-shaped, approximately 520 km along its southeastern coastline, and from 29 to 146\xa0km (18–91\xa0miles) wide, not including a small central peninsula. The air-line distance from west to east is 477 km. The island is the 38th largest in the world, with an area of .  Steep cliffs form some sections of the coastline; in others the mountains are further inland, and the coastal area is flat and bordered by coral reefs. The highest point, at 2,438\xa0m (7,999\xa0ft), is Mount Sinewit in the Baining range in the east. Most of the terrain is covered with tropical rainforest and several large rivers are fed by the high rainfall.  New Britain was largely formed by volcanic processes, and there are several active volcanoes on the island, including Ulawun (the highest volcano in Papua New Guinea), Langila, the Garbuna Group, the Sulu Range, and the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan of the Rabaul caldera. A major eruption of Tavurvur in 1994 destroyed the East New Britain provincial capital of Rabaul. Most of the town still lies under metres of ash, and the capital has been moved to nearby Kokopo.  Administrative divisions  New Britain forms part of the Islands Region, one of four regions of Papua New Guinea. It comprises the mainland of two provinces:  * East New Britain with headquarters in Kokopo (formerly Rabaul)  * West New Britain with headquarters in Kimbe  Modern history   For the missionary history, see Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Solomon Islands  1700–1914  William Dampier became the first known European to visit New Britain on 27 February 1700: he dubbed the island with the Latin name Nova Britannia, (Eng: New Britain).  In November 1884, Germany proclaimed its protectorate over the New Britain Archipelago; the German colonial administration gave New Britain and New Ireland the names of Neupommern (or Neu-Pommern; "New Pomerania") and Neumecklenburg (or Neu-Mecklenburg; "New Mecklenburg") respectively, and the whole island group was renamed the Bismarck Archipelago. New Britain became part of German New Guinea.  In 1909, the indigenous population was estimated at about 190,000; the foreign population at 773 (474 white). The expatriate population was practically confined to the northeastern Gazelle Peninsula, which included the capital, Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo). At the time 5,448 hectares (13,464 acres) had been converted to plantations, primarily growing copra, cotton, coffee and rubber. Westerners avoided exploring the interior initially, believing that the indigenous peoples were warlike and would fiercely resist intrusions.  World War I  On 11 September 1914, New Britain became the site of one of the earliest battles of World War I when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island. They quickly overwhelmed the German forces and occupied the island for the duration of the war.  Between the world wars  After World War I the Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919, where Germany was stripped on all its possessions outside Europe. In 1920 the League of Nations included New Britain along with the former German colony on New Guinea in the Territory of New Guinea, a mandated territory of Australia.  World War II  During World War II the Japanese attacked New Britain soon after the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean.

Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.  Blomkvist breaks into Martin\'s house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist.

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings. On the first Friday of each month, crowds of locals and visitors head to the First Friday Gallery Hop at Railroad Square, a former lumber yard in downtown Tallahassee that is now home to over 50 eclectic shops, galleries and art studios.

But, asks Ed Caesar, will New Rupert draw the kids?  Monday 6 November 2006 00:00 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  Rupert, it seems, will bear anything. Over nine decades, the Daily Express stalwart has withstood changes of fur colour, allegations of racism, and a lurid sex scandal. He even survived the recent jobs cull at Express Newspapers (although, because of "restructuring", he may have started subbing the arts pages and filing a sports column). Now, Rupert Bear, as all public figures eventually must, has one more obstacle to overcome: re-branding.  On Wednesday, exactly 86 years after he began life on what was then Britain\'s best-selling newspaper, a jazzed-up Rupert will appear on Five, in a new children\'s programme called Rupert Bear - Follow the Magic. Although Rupert is ostensibly unchanged, he has a whole new outlook on life. He runs. He jumps. He rides a scooter. He helps to clean up the environment in his bucolic fictional home, Nutwood.  Despite a number of scare stories circulated in the nationals last week, the new Rupert does not wear a hoodie. Nor does he refer to his friends as "blud" and "homie". Indeed, Rupert looks, at first glance, unchanged. The garish yellow check trousers and red jumper remain (although Rupert now sports snazzy red trainers instead of boots.) And, following the old maxim that you can tell a bear by the company he keeps, Rupert is seeing less of his old boys, like Algy Pug, preferring to hang out with diverse, funky cats like Ping Pong, a feisty five-year-old girl with magic powers, and Miranda the Mermaid.  It sounds suspiciously like Rupert has employed the same re-invention gurus as David Cameron\'s Conservatives. In fact, he is using Entertainment Rights, Britain\'s leading children\'s intellectual property owners. Their last major success was to re-work Postman Pat from a cat-owning loner into a snowboarding family man. So will Rupert be snowboarding, or is he just another tweed-wearing Tory in disguise?  "Rupert won\'t be snowboarding," says Jane Smith, commercial director for Entertainment Rights, "unless, of course, it snows in Nutwood. The thing about Rupert is that he\'s 86 years old. So there\'s a huge heritage there. We\'ve tried to make him into a pre-school character, and he\'s never been one before. So we\'ve had to make him more exciting for today\'s kids."  Does that mean the gentle, pottering Rupert of old - a bear for whom a treasure hunt was the pinnacle of adventure - is gone?  "Absolutely not," says Smith. "We\'re going to operate a dual-brand strategy. We\'re keeping Classic Rupert, which will be a much more adult, collectible type of brand [Royal Doulton are creating a new Rupert range]. And then we\'re developing New Rupert for children\'s television. Classic Rupert will still appear in the Express, and The Rupert Annual."  Over the years, "Classic Rupert" has had a bumpy ride. Conceived in November 1920 by Mary Tourtel as a brown-furred bear, Rupert started life in the Daily Express with two cartoons a day, and a short story underneath. The penny-pinchers at the Express, though, quickly realised that white was much cheaper to print than brown, and Rupert\'s colour soon changed (although in the Netherlands he is still known as "Rupert Brown Bear").  When Tourtel\'s eyesight deteriorated in 1935, a Punch illustrator called Alfred Bestall was asked to fill in for six weeks. He drew the cartoon for 30 years, until his retirement in 1965, and was the original contributor to The Rupert Annual | Question: What colour jumper does fictional character Rupert the Bear wear?', ['red'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1117'), ("Context: While the modern Coast Guard was created by the merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service in 1915 , its roots go back to the early days of the Republic .

His brother was Richard Ainley (1910-1967) and his father Henry Ainley (1879-1945). He worked in the theatre for many years and eventually found work in various historical film dramas in the 1970s. However, his claim to fame is in the casting in the role of the Master in the long running science fiction series, "Doctor Who" (1963). He joined the team in 1980, appearing in at least one of every six episodes per year until 1986 - when his contract expired. However, he did reprise the role for the final Doctor Who episode entitled \'Survival\' - where the Master was supposedly killed off. He retired from acting professionally in the late nineties and played cricket up until the time of his death in May 2004.  TRIVIA:  He was a keen cricketer for many years.  By the mid-eighties, he had come into some money that allowed him to live a comfortable life without acting.  He was the fourth actor to portray the Master in "Doctor Who" (1963). The character had previously been played by \'Roger Delgado\' (qv), \'Peter Pratt\' (qv) and \'Geoffrey Beevers\' (qv).  He played the Master in \'Doctor Who\' for nine years - the longest serving actor to appear as a regular character in the TV series\' history.  He was on the shortlist for Prof Watson (played by Glyn Houston) in Doctor Who: The Hand of Fear.  Just as his Doctor Who character "The Master" would use anagrams to conceal his identity, Ainley would be credited with an anagram of his own name to hide the fact that a character he was playing in certain episodes was The Master in Disguise. Most notably, this led to his credit in "Castrovalva" episode 3 being "Neil Toynay" (Tony Ainley).  After \'Roger Delgado\' (qv), \'Peter Pratt\' (qv) and \'Geoffrey Beevers\' (qv), he was the fourth actor to play the Master, the Doctor\'s greatest enemy, in _"Doctor Who" (1963)_ (qv). He played the role from the 1981 serial "The Keeper of Traken" to the 1989 serial "Survival". He is the longest running Master. He was succeeded in the role by \'Gordon Tipple\' (qv), \'Eric Roberts (I)\' (qv), Sir \'Derek Jacobi\' (qv) and \'John Simm\' (qv).  He despised cheeses of all kinds.

I find it incredible that Maurice is no longer alive'\xa0  Olga Craig  12:01AM BST 13 Jul 2008  Robin Gibb, co-creator of the most gloriously shallow pop ever, now wears several deeply serious hats: guardian of British heritage, confidante of world leaders, and 21st century Mozart. He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)

Despite being one of the most historically significant sites of Thailand’s modern history, the large congregation of yellow and white buildings along the Chao Praya River in Bangkok which make up the Thammasat University would not strike the casual observer as anything particularly interesting. Nonetheless, the events which transpired here between 1973 and 1976 not only led to the creation of Thailand’s current pseudo-parliamentary democracy, but also give testimony to how those in power have used violence and intimidation as a means of keeping the country socially and politically conservative.  Between 1968 and 1973, hundreds of thousands of students, supported by workers, businesspeople and many ordinary citizens, took part in protests against the military dictatorship of Thanom Kittikachorn . On October 14, 1973 , police opened fire on a large student demonstration. As the military sent troops, tanks and helicopters to Thammasat University, students reportedly commandeered buses and fire trucks in order to use them as battering rams against the tanks. Students fleeing the university campus were shot by military troops while students who remained inside were fired upon by helicopters. It was this atrocity and the following popular outrage which led King Bhumibol to oust the dictator Thanom and replace him with Sanya Dharmasakti, the head chancellor of Thammasat University, as the new Prime Minister of the country.  Under this new government, the political scene remained unstable, as the installment of communist regimes in neighboring Vietnam and Laos — in addition to large general strikes at home — fed fears of the ruling elite that left-wing activists were setting the stage for a communist takeover. These fears were exacerbated by the conservative media controlled by elements within the military. In response, the military started to train tens of thousands of right-wing militias in advanced military drills and combat skills. Subsequently, the royal family invited the former dictator Thanom back from his exile in Singapore, in preparation for a military coup against the government which they saw as being too weak on leftist agitators.  Student Massacre  On October 5, 1976, students and trade unionists occupied Thammasat University to protest against Thanom’s return to the country. The conservative media at the time falsely claimed that the protesters had hanged an effigy of the royal prince, sparking outrage amongst the militias which enjoyed the backing of the royalty. Early the next morning, on October 6, the university was surrounded by thousands of military, police, and militia members. The gates to the occupied university were broken down and the ensuing massacre which followed has been described as a “wild outbreak of kicking, clubbing, shooting, and lynching.” Students were hung, tortured and raped, bodies were burned, and those who jumped into the river, trying to escape, were shot by naval vassals. Following the three-hour long carnage, where over a hundred students were reportedly killed, the military ousted the government to ‘protect the monarchy’, effectively putting the country under martial law.  The aftermath of the massacre forced leftist activists underground as the new royally appointed reactionary Prime Minister Tanin Kraivichien rounded up thousands of suspected leftists, censored the media and made joining a communist organization punishable by death. Even today, decades after the transition to a pseudo-parliamentary democracy, the government still imprisons those who criticize the country’s most undemocratic institution, the monarchy. As a result, the political arena lacks any sort of true egalitarian representation and instead fluctuates from moderate right to extreme right.  Thaksin’s Rise and Fall  In 2001, after years of dictatorship, Thaksin Shinawatra, a business tycoon who made his fortune in the telecommunication industry, was elected Prime Minister of Thailand. His political party, the populist Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais, TRT) party, attempted to address the country’s rampant economic poverty with regulated capitalism. The reforms implemented by Thaksin, when compared to the previous line of ultra-conservative dictators, made him seem like the most progressive politician on the scene, despite his pro-business, authoritarian agenda.

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Biography  During the mid-\'70s, Germany\'s Kraftwerk established the sonic blueprint followed by an extraordinary number of artists in the decades to come. From the British new romantic movement to hip-hop to techno, the group\'s self-described "robot pop" -- hypnotically minimal, obliquely rhythmic music performed solely via electronic means -- resonates in virtually every new development to impact the contemporary pop scene of the late- 20th century, and as pioneers of the electronic music form, their enduring influence cannot be overstated. Kraftwerk emerged from the same German experimental music community of the late \'60s which also spawned Can and Tangerine Dream; primary members Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter first met as classical music students at the Dusseldorf Conservatory, originally teaming in the group Organisation and issuing a 1970 album, Tone Float, in the U.K. Schneider and Hütter soon disbanded Organisation, re-christening themselves Kraftwerk (German for "power station"), beginning work on their own studio (later dubbed Kling Klang), and immersing their music in the fledgling world of minimalist electronics; their 1971 debut, titled simply Kraftwerk 1, offered a hint of their unique aesthetic in its earliest form, already implementing innovations including Schneider\'s attempts at designing homemade rhythm machines.  A series of lineup shifts followed, and at one point Hütter even left the group; however, by the release of 1972\'s Kraftwerk 2, he and Schneider were again working in tandem. Recorded without a live drummer, the album\'s rhythms relied solely on a drum machine, creating a distinctly robotic feel without precedent -- the concept of purely technological music was, at the time, utterly alien to most musicians, as well as listeners. A series of well-received live performances followed before Kraftwerk began work on their breakthrough third LP, 1973\'s Ralf and Florian; honing their many ambitions down to a few simple yet extraordinarily innovative concepts, their music began growing more and more revelatory -- even their clean-cut, scientific image was in direct opposition to the dominant pop fashions of the time. Kraftwerk\'s first album to be issued in the U.S., 1974\'s Autobahn was an international smash; an edited single version of the epic title track was a major hit at home and abroad, and in America the previously unknown group reached the upper rungs of the pop albums chart. | Question: What techno group was formed in Düsseldorf in 1970?', ['kraftwerk'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3985'), ("Context: The NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the value of producing a translation in the common language of the American people .

Previously in the Gdańsk Voivodeship (1975–1998), Puck has been the capital of Puck County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999.  Contents  History[ edit ]  13th century Gothic church in Puck  The settlement became a marketplace and a seaport as early as the 7th century. The name, as was common during the Middle Ages , was spelled differently: in a 1277 document Putzc, 1277 Pusecz, 1288 Puczse and Putsk, 1289 Pucz. In 1309 it came under the rule of the Teutonic Order as part of Pomerelia . Puck achieved town status in 1348. Together with the rest of Royal Prussia , it joined Poland in 1454 ( 1466 ) and was the place of the local County Administration ( Starostwo ). The Polish kings tried to create a fleet at Danzig, but independent Hanseatic Danzig would not allow them in their territory. Ships chartered by Poland had to land at Pautzke (Puck) in 1567. Poland tried to establish a Polish Navy , gaining the use some harbors in Livonia and Finland, but a standing navy never materialized. Swedish-Lithuanian Vasa King of Poland-Lithuania Sigismund III also tried to establish a fleet in his attempts to wrest the crown of Sweden from King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden , but Sigismund's attempts were destroyed in 1628.  The first actual Polish Navy was founded at the end of World War I in 1918 with some French and British involvement.  In 1772, through the Partitions of Poland , the western Prussian town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia . After the First World War I, Puck was assigned to the Second Polish Republic by the Treaty of Versailles . In 1920 Poland celebrated Poland's Wedding to the Sea in Puck. Puck was the only Polish harbour until Gdynia was built in the 1920s and served as the main harbour of the Polish Navy until the Second World War.  Puck was bombed by Nazi Germany at 5.20am Polish time on Friday September 1, known thereafter as Grey Friday. A Luftwaffe bomber dropped a single projectile on the town, which also had an airbase.  The British and French declaration of war came two days later. That week TIME magazine in New York put a black and white picture of the Polish commander in chief, Edward Rydz-Śmigły on its cover.  After Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939, a branch of the Stutthof concentration camp existed in Puck in the years 1941 to 1944. After 1945 Puck was part of the Republic of Poland .

I find it incredible that Maurice is no longer alive'\xa0  Olga Craig  12:01AM BST 13 Jul 2008  Robin Gibb, co-creator of the most gloriously shallow pop ever, now wears several deeply serious hats: guardian of British heritage, confidante of world leaders, and 21st century Mozart. He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.

Despite being one of the most historically significant sites of Thailand’s modern history, the large congregation of yellow and white buildings along the Chao Praya River in Bangkok which make up the Thammasat University would not strike the casual observer as anything particularly interesting. Nonetheless, the events which transpired here between 1973 and 1976 not only led to the creation of Thailand’s current pseudo-parliamentary democracy, but also give testimony to how those in power have used violence and intimidation as a means of keeping the country socially and politically conservative.  Between 1968 and 1973, hundreds of thousands of students, supported by workers, businesspeople and many ordinary citizens, took part in protests against the military dictatorship of Thanom Kittikachorn . On October 14, 1973 , police opened fire on a large student demonstration. As the military sent troops, tanks and helicopters to Thammasat University, students reportedly commandeered buses and fire trucks in order to use them as battering rams against the tanks. Students fleeing the university campus were shot by military troops while students who remained inside were fired upon by helicopters. It was this atrocity and the following popular outrage which led King Bhumibol to oust the dictator Thanom and replace him with Sanya Dharmasakti, the head chancellor of Thammasat University, as the new Prime Minister of the country.  Under this new government, the political scene remained unstable, as the installment of communist regimes in neighboring Vietnam and Laos — in addition to large general strikes at home — fed fears of the ruling elite that left-wing activists were setting the stage for a communist takeover. These fears were exacerbated by the conservative media controlled by elements within the military. In response, the military started to train tens of thousands of right-wing militias in advanced military drills and combat skills. Subsequently, the royal family invited the former dictator Thanom back from his exile in Singapore, in preparation for a military coup against the government which they saw as being too weak on leftist agitators.  Student Massacre  On October 5, 1976, students and trade unionists occupied Thammasat University to protest against Thanom’s return to the country. The conservative media at the time falsely claimed that the protesters had hanged an effigy of the royal prince, sparking outrage amongst the militias which enjoyed the backing of the royalty. Early the next morning, on October 6, the university was surrounded by thousands of military, police, and militia members. The gates to the occupied university were broken down and the ensuing massacre which followed has been described as a “wild outbreak of kicking, clubbing, shooting, and lynching.” Students were hung, tortured and raped, bodies were burned, and those who jumped into the river, trying to escape, were shot by naval vassals. Following the three-hour long carnage, where over a hundred students were reportedly killed, the military ousted the government to ‘protect the monarchy’, effectively putting the country under martial law.  The aftermath of the massacre forced leftist activists underground as the new royally appointed reactionary Prime Minister Tanin Kraivichien rounded up thousands of suspected leftists, censored the media and made joining a communist organization punishable by death. Even today, decades after the transition to a pseudo-parliamentary democracy, the government still imprisons those who criticize the country’s most undemocratic institution, the monarchy. As a result, the political arena lacks any sort of true egalitarian representation and instead fluctuates from moderate right to extreme right.  Thaksin’s Rise and Fall  In 2001, after years of dictatorship, Thaksin Shinawatra, a business tycoon who made his fortune in the telecommunication industry, was elected Prime Minister of Thailand. His political party, the populist Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais, TRT) party, attempted to address the country’s rampant economic poverty with regulated capitalism. The reforms implemented by Thaksin, when compared to the previous line of ultra-conservative dictators, made him seem like the most progressive politician on the scene, despite his pro-business, authoritarian agenda.

See More  Solitaire (Jane Seymour) - James Bond Wiki - WikiaSolitaire (Jane Seymour) | James Bond Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Solitaire is a fictional character in the James Bond novel and film Live and Let Die . In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Biography  During the mid-\'70s, Germany\'s Kraftwerk established the sonic blueprint followed by an extraordinary number of artists in the decades to come. From the British new romantic movement to hip-hop to techno, the group\'s self-described "robot pop" -- hypnotically minimal, obliquely rhythmic music performed solely via electronic means -- resonates in virtually every new development to impact the contemporary pop scene of the late- 20th century, and as pioneers of the electronic music form, their enduring influence cannot be overstated. Kraftwerk emerged from the same German experimental music community of the late \'60s which also spawned Can and Tangerine Dream; primary members Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter first met as classical music students at the Dusseldorf Conservatory, originally teaming in the group Organisation and issuing a 1970 album, Tone Float, in the U.K. Schneider and Hütter soon disbanded Organisation, re-christening themselves Kraftwerk (German for "power station"), beginning work on their own studio (later dubbed Kling Klang), and immersing their music in the fledgling world of minimalist electronics; their 1971 debut, titled simply Kraftwerk 1, offered a hint of their unique aesthetic in its earliest form, already implementing innovations including Schneider\'s attempts at designing homemade rhythm machines.  A series of lineup shifts followed, and at one point Hütter even left the group; however, by the release of 1972\'s Kraftwerk 2, he and Schneider were again working in tandem. Recorded without a live drummer, the album\'s rhythms relied solely on a drum machine, creating a distinctly robotic feel without precedent -- the concept of purely technological music was, at the time, utterly alien to most musicians, as well as listeners. A series of well-received live performances followed before Kraftwerk began work on their breakthrough third LP, 1973\'s Ralf and Florian; honing their many ambitions down to a few simple yet extraordinarily innovative concepts, their music began growing more and more revelatory -- even their clean-cut, scientific image was in direct opposition to the dominant pop fashions of the time. Kraftwerk\'s first album to be issued in the U.S., 1974\'s Autobahn was an international smash; an edited single version of the epic title track was a major hit at home and abroad, and in America the previously unknown group reached the upper rungs of the pop albums chart. | Question: What techno group was formed in Düsseldorf in 1970?', ['kraftwerk'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3985'), ("Context: The NIV began in 1956 with the formation of a small committee to study the value of producing a translation in the common language of the American people .
