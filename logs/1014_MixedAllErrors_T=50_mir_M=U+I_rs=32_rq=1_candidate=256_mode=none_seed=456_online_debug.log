The venom contains some substances ( RVV - V and RVV - X ) which directly activate factor V and factor X , which turns prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of phospholipid and calcium . In the dRVVT assay , low , rate - limiting concentrations of both Russell 's viper venom and phospholipid are used to give a standard clotting time of 23 to 27 seconds . This makes the test sensitive to the presence of lupus anticoagulants , because these antibodies interfere with the clot - promoting role of phospholipid in vitro , and their presence results in a prolonged clotting time . A mixing study is then performed , which consists of adding an equal volume of the patient 's plasma to normal plasma ; in this study , one would expect the clotting time to return to the normal range if there was only a deficiency of coagulation factors alone . A prolonged clotting time of 30 seconds or greater that does not correct despite the mixing study suggests the presence of a lupus anticoagulant . An abnormal result for the initial dRVVT assay should be followed by a dRVVT confirmatory test . In this test , the inhibitory effect of lupus anticoagulants on phospholipids in the dRVVT can be overcome by adding an excess of phospholipid to the assay . The clotting times of both the initial dRVVT assay and confirmatory test are normalized and then used to determine a ratio of time without phospholipid excess to time with phospholipid excess . In general , a ratio of greater than 1.3 is considered a positive result and implies that the patient may have antiphospholipid antibodies . The dRVVT test has a higher specificity than the aPTT test for the detection of lupus anticoagulant , because it is not influenced by deficiencies or inhibitors of clotting factors VIII , IX or XI as the venom only activates factors V and X . | Question: dilute russell 's viper venom test ( drvvt ) which coagulation factor is activated by the venom ?", ['factor V', 'factor X'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-59008'), ("Context: The Great Dividing Range , or the Eastern Highlands , is Australia 's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land - based range in the world .

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.

Government - issued ID cards are also issued to out - of - state residents e.g. college students enrolled in an institution of higher education outside their state of residence e.g. a domiciled Texas resident enrolled at UCLA where the individual retains their Texas driver license and holds a California state issued ID card ( as mentioned above e.g. bank account and financial affairs ) ; also applicable to those who own business assets and not domiciled in a state or city as a resident e.g. one domiciled in Los Angeles and owns either a business or real estate property in Florida ) . In the United States no individual can hold two valid driver licenses , e.g. a Texas and California driver license held simultaneously , since some U.S. states do not collect personal income taxes e.g. Texas , Florida while California has a personal state income tax . | Question: who is the issuing authority of a drivers license ?", ['the states and provinces ( or territories )'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-37766'), ("Context: `` ( I 've Had ) The Time of My Life '' is a 1987 song composed by Franke Previte , John DeNicola , and Donald Markowitz .

The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum . | Question: where is the brain located in the skull ?', ['skull bones of the head .'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-23035'), ("Context: The astronomical unit ( symbol : au or ua ) is a unit of length , roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun .

The two contests were merged after the Review of Reviews agreed to being integrated into the government initiative . The £ 75 prize money of each competition were combined and augmented by a further £ 50 donated by Havelock Tobacco Company . Each competitor was required to submit two coloured sketches , a red ensign for the merchant service and public use , and a blue ensign for naval and official use . The designs were judged on seven criteria : loyalty to the Empire , Federation , history , heraldry , distinctiveness , utility and cost of manufacture . The majority of designs incorporated the Union Flag and the Southern Cross , but native animals were also popular , including one that depicted a variety of indigenous animals playing cricket . The entries were put on display at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne and the judges took six days to deliberate before reaching their conclusion . Five almost identical entries were chosen as the winning design , and their designers shared the £ 200 ( 2015 : $29,142.12 ) prize money .

A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number . For example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6 . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering .

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them.

Outside the dreams , the film reflects contemporary racist attitudes . | Question: who played the first black president in a movie ?", ['Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1933 film Rufus Jones for President'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-71795')]

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

This line stretches from the hip joint ( or more precisely the head of the femur ) , through the knee joint ( the intercondylar eminence of the tibia ) , and down to the center of the ankle ( the ankle mortise , the fork - like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli ) . In the tibial shaft , the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide , but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6 ° , resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174 ° in a leg with normal axial alignment . A leg is considered straight when , with the feet brought together , both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching . Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis ( intermalleolar distance exceeds 3 cm ) , and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis ( intercondylar distance exceeds 5 cm ) . These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh 's adductors and abductors . The angle of inclination formed between the neck and shaft of the femur , ( collodiaphysial angle ) , varies with age -- about 150 ° in the newborn , it gradually decreases to 126 - 128 ° in adults , to reach 120 ° in old age . Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg : A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga ; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum . Additionally , a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle , the torsion angle , which makes it possible for flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head . Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward ; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility . | Question: what is the joint at the top of the leg called ?", ['hip joint ( or more precisely the head of the femur )'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-71370'), ('Context: Little Italy is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan , New York City , once known for its large population of Italian Americans .

This author uses an example of the contractile elements present in the porifera or sponges that do truly lack this striated muscle containing this protein . Furthermore , Steinmetz et al. present evidence for a polyphyletic origin of striated muscle cell development through their analysis of morphological and molecular markers that are present in bilaterians and absent in cnidarians , ctenophores , and bilaterians . Steimetz et al. showed that the traditional morphological and regulatory markers such as actin , the ability to couple myosin side chains phosphorylation to higher concentrations of the positive concentrations of calcium , and other MyHC elements are present in all metazoans not just the organisms that have been shown to have muscle cells . Thus , the usage of any of these structural or regulatory elements in determining whether or not the muscle cells of the cnidarians and ctenophores are similar enough to the muscle cells of the bilaterians to confirm a single lineage is questionable according to Steinmetz et al. Furthermore , Steinmetz et al. explain that the orthologues of the MyHc genes that have been used to hypothesize the origin of striated muscle occurred through a gene duplication event that predates the first true muscle cells ( meaning striated muscle ) , and they show that the MyHc genes are present in the sponges that have contractile elements but no true muscle cells . Furthermore , Steinmetz et all showed that the localization of this duplicated set of genes that serve both the function of facilitating the formation of striated muscle genes and cell regulation and movement genes were already separated into striated myhc and non-muscle myhc . This separation of the duplicated set of genes is shown through the localization of the striated myhc to the contractile vacuole in sponges while the non-muscle myhc was more diffusely expressed during developmental cell shape and change .

Olivia Nuzzi  09.27.14 12:55 AM ET  Had John McCain been elected president in 2008, Sarah Palin still may not have ever set foot in the White House…because she wouldn’t have been able to find it.  On Friday afternoon, the failed reality-television star and one-time VP nominee materialized in Washington, clad in a leather blazer, to deliver a speech to the crowd at the Values Voter Summit—an annual social-conservative confab held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, a sprawling, gilded maze of a place that is rumored to be haunted by a dead maid.  Maybe she was the one screwing with Palin’s notes, because about halfway through her remarks, Palin said this: “Don’t retreat: You reload with truth, which I know is an endangered species at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue. Anyway, truth.”  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.  One assumes Palin was attempting to say truth is an endangered species at the White House, which is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue is roughly a plaza in front of the Willard Hotel.  Palin is not the first politician to make this mistake. On Aug. 1, 2008, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, Republican from Texas, wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush, which he addressed to:  “The President  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, D.C. 20500”  I would like to imagine Conaway has spent the last six years wondering why he never received a response.  Out in the hallway of the Omni Shoreham, I talked to conservative women who felt that Palin’s mistake was not a big deal: “She speaks from the heart,” Marlea Knighton of Arizona, said. “The news never misprints?” Linda, an older lady from Virginia, said that anyone criticizing Palin for not knowing where the White House is located is just doing it “because they’re scared of what she says,” because women “who love the Lord” are intimidating to non-believers, like those populating the mainstream media.  Mark Roeske, who operates campaign buses, offered a different take: Conservative women like Palin intimidate feminist women because “they’re women who are not just a vagina,” and so they feel compelled to attack her whenever possible and make her seem stupid.  Gaffe aside, the rest of Palin’s speech was an unremarkable, nonsensical collection of Palinisms haphazardly strung together and delivered in her signature bright-yet-bitter-sounding sing-song style—like a homicidal kindergarten teacher.  “You’re the Americans that the media loves to hate,” she crooned, menacingly. And then, “All you mama grizzlies out there, rear up and charge against the lawless, imperial president and his failed liberal agenda and the lapdogs in the media.” And then, “So, I’m out in the shop with Todd, and he’s winterizing his snow plane.”  Let’s hope Todd has a better sense of direction.

Acmthompson  The island of Malta received the George Cross in recognition of its inhabitants’ gallantry in World War II. Recipients of this award may add G.C. after their names; the cross ranks second only to the Victoria Cross (the highest British military decoration). The cross is silver, with one side depicting St. George slaying the dragon and with the inscription “For Gallantry;” the other side gives the recipient’s name and the date of the award.  The George Medal, instituted at the same time as the George Cross, is analogous to it but is awarded for services not quite so outstanding as those which merit the George Cross.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously.

New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback?

Out of loneliness , he has adopted various sports balls as `` buddies '' and drawn faces on them . He has painted `` Alive in Tucson '' on billboards and highway signs during his trip , hoping others might see the message . Phil is married to Carol and they have twin girls together .

Pope's paternal grandfather is supposed to have been Alexander Pope, rector of Thruxton, Hampshire (instituted 1 May 1630–1; information from the Winchester bishop's register, communicated by Mr. J. C. Smith, of Somerset House), who died in 1645. The poet's father, according to his epitaph, was seventy-five at his death, 23 Oct. 1717, and therefore born in 1641 or 1642 (see also P. T.'s letter to Curll in Pope's Works, by Elwin and Courthope, vi. 423, where he is said to have been a posthumous son). According to Warton, he was a merchant at Lisbon, where he was converted to catholicism. He was afterwards a linendraper in Broad Street, London. A first wife, Magdalen, was buried 12 Aug. 1679 (register of St. Benet Fink); he had by her a daughter Magdalen, afterwards Mrs. Rackett; and in the Pangbourne register, Ambrose Staveley, the rector, records the burial of 'Alexander Pope, son of my brother-in law, Alexander Pope, merchant of London,' on 1 Sept. 1682 ( information from Mr. J. C. Smith). Pope's statement in a note in the Epistle to Arbuthnot, that his father belonged to the family of the earls of Downe, appears to have been a fiction (Warton, Essay, ii. 255). The poet's maternal grandfather descended from a family of small landowners in Yorkshire. He had seventeen children, one of whom, Edith, the poet's mother, was baptised on 18 June 1642, though, according to her epitaph, she was ninety-three at her death on 7 June 1733. Christiana, another daughter, married the portrait-painter, Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) [q. v.], and at her death in 1693, left some china, pictures, and medals to her nephew. Three of her sons, according to Pope's statement (Epistle to Arbuthnot), were in the service of Charles I. Alexander Pope, the linendraper, after his second marriage, moved his business to Lombard Street. He made some money by his trade, and in or before 1700 moved to Binfield in Windsor Forest. It appears from his will (Carruthers, Pope, 1857, p. 463) that he had some landed property, and he also invested money in French rentes (Works, vi. 189, 201). The story, first told by Ruffhead, that he put all his money in a strong-box and lived upon the principal, is therefore erroneous. As a catholic, he was exposed to various disqualifications; but he appears to have lived comfortably among the country gentry. He had many friends among the Roman catholics, several of whom lived near the forest. He was fond of gardening, and had twenty acres of land round his house at Binfield. One room of the house is said to remain, and a row of Scottish firs near it was apparently there in Pope's time.  Pope was precocious, and in his infancy healthy. He was called the ‘little nightingale’ from the beauty of his voice, a name still applied to him in later years by the dramatist Southern (Ruffhead, p. 476; Orrery, Swift, p. 207). A portrait, painted when he was ten years old, showed him ‘plump and pretty, and of a fresh complexion.’ This is said to have been like him at the time; but a severe illness two years later, brought on by ‘perpetual application,’ ruined his health and distorted his figure (Spence | Question: What was the first name of the poet Mr. Pope, 1688-1744?", ['alexander'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1860'), ('Context: In India , the Panchayati Raj now functions as a system of governance in which gram panchayats are the basic units of local administration .

The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.  A Last Hurrah  In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.  \xa0  Final Stop  After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.  \xa0  The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.  \xa0  At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension , a spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically . | Question: a rift valley is evidence of which kind of plate boundary ?', ['a divergent plate boundary'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-26846')]

The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons , muscles , and glands . In certain sensory neurons ( pseudounipolar neurons ) , such as those for touch and warmth , the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body , and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon . Axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons . Nerve fibers are classed into three types -- group A nerve fibers , group B nerve fibers , and group C nerve fibers . Groups A and B are myelinated , and group C are unmyelinated .

10/14/2021 02:26:01 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: Bachmann\'s bundleIn the heart\'s conduction system, Bachmann\'s bundle (also called the Bachmann bundle or the interatrial tract) is a branch of the anterior internodal tract that resides on the inner wall of the left atrium. It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074'), ('Context: The target range shooting distance is 50 metres ( 160 ft ) .

The song uses a rainstorm as a metaphor for troubles in life , while encouraging others to `` make it through the rain '' through perseverance . The first chorus begins : `` When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved '' , illustrating a moment in an individual 's life where they are surrounded by conflict . The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering , `` I can make it through the rain , I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I 'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain '' .

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: The Cape of Good Hope , also known as the Cape Colony ( Dutch : Kaapkolonie ) , was a British colony in present - day South Africa , named after the Cape of Good Hope .

The legal minimum age to enter into a marriage in England and Wales is sixteen years , although this requires parental consent if a participant is under eighteen . Certain relatives are not allowed to marry . For foreign nationals , there are also residency conditions that have to be met before people can be married . Same - sex marriage was introduced under the Marriage ( Same Sex Couples ) Act in March 2014 . Prior to this , civil partnerships had been made available to same - sex couples in the United Kingdom in 2005 , granting rights and responsibilities virtually identical to civil marriage .

In contrast , the lateral longitudinal arch is very low . With the cuboid serving as its keystone , it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal .

Security was tight for the funeral service in east London.  Criminal twins  The brothers arrived separately - both were handcuffed to a prison guard and flanked by police officers.  Ronnie Kray was brought from Broadmoor Hospital for the criminally insane in Berkshire where he has spent the last four years.  His brother travelled from Parkhurst Prison in the Isle of Wight where he is still held as a maximum security Category "A" prisoner.  The service was attended by a number of celebrities and underworld figures known to the twins from the days when they ran one of London\'s biggest criminal operations.

Outdoor sequences to the film were shot near June Lake , east of the Yosemite National Park . The actors were initially uncertain with the strength of the three main characters in the film and how the hero Joe Kidd would come across . According to writer Leonard , the initial slow development between the three was probably because the cast were so initially awestruck by having Sturges direct that they surrendered authority to him . Eastwood was far from being in perfect health during the film and suffered symptoms that suggested a bronchial infection , in addition to having several panic attacks , falsely reported in the media as his having an allergy to horses . During production , the script for the finale was altered when producer Robert Daley jokingly said that a train should crash through the barroom in the climax , and he was taken seriously by cast and crew , who thought it was a great idea . | Question: where did they film the movie joe kidd ?", ['Old Tucson', 'near June Lake , east of the Yosemite National Park'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63001'), ("Context: Amazon.co.uk:Customer Reviews: The Heroes of Telemark [DVD ...Amazon.co.uk:Customer Reviews: The Heroes of Telemark [DVD] [1965]  The Heroes of Telemark [DVD] [1965]  4.5 out of 5 stars  100  Price:£3.47+ Free shipping with Amazon Prime  Your rating( Clear )Rate this item  18 people found this helpful  4.0 out of 5 starsMann on a mission  ByTrevor Willsmeron 24 January 2009  Anthony Mann's last completed film, The Heroes of Telemark doesn't have the kind of reputation most of his later films enjoy, yet it's still a cut above most men-on-a-mission war movies of its day. Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb. Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films. A few years later, this kind of thing would be done better with WHERE EAGLES DARE. It's kind of hard to accept Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris as Norwegians, not surprisingly the Swedish Ulla Jacobsson (Bergman's SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT) is more convincing.

The competition attracted 32,823 entries , including those originally sent to the one held earlier by the Review of Reviews . One of these was submitted by an unnamed governor of a colony . The two contests were merged after the Review of Reviews agreed to being integrated into the government initiative . The £ 75 prize money of each competition were combined and augmented by a further £ 50 donated by Havelock Tobacco Company . Each competitor was required to submit two coloured sketches , a red ensign for the merchant service and public use , and a blue ensign for naval and official use . The designs were judged on seven criteria : loyalty to the Empire , Federation , history , heraldry , distinctiveness , utility and cost of manufacture . The majority of designs incorporated the Union Flag and the Southern Cross , but native animals were also popular , including one that depicted a variety of indigenous animals playing cricket . The entries were put on display at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne and the judges took six days to deliberate before reaching their conclusion . Five almost identical entries were chosen as the winning design , and their designers shared the £ 200 ( 2015 : $29,142.12 ) prize money . They were Ivor Evans , a fourteen - year - old schoolboy from Melbourne ; Leslie John Hawkins , a teenager apprenticed to an optician from Sydney ; Egbert John Nuttall , an architect from Melbourne ; Annie Dorrington , an artist from Perth ; and William Stevens , a ship 's officer from Auckland , New Zealand .

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand. It sits behind a goal, with the family stand to the right, main stand to the left, and the kop directly opposite.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  Special relationships exist between the measures of consecutive angles, opposite angles and opposite sides of a parallelogram. A square is the most straightforward parallelogram, because it has 2 sets of parallel sides. Naturally, all of its angles and sides match in length or measure.  Facts About a Parallelogram  (1) The degree measure of the four angles of a parallelogram add up to 360 degrees. Remember that all quadrilaterals (4 sided figures) have angles which add up to 360 degrees. Here's a sample:  Then: a + b + c + d = 360 degrees  (2) The degree measure of any two consecutive angles add up to 180 degrees.                 In parallelogram ABCD:  angle a + angle b = 180 degrees  angle b + angle c = 180 degrees  angle c + angle d = 180 degrees  angle a + angle d = 180 degrees  (3) Opposite angles have the same measure in terms of degrees.  In parallelogram ABCD:  (1) Opposite sides are parallel:  side AD || side BC  NOTE: The symbol || means parallel.  (2) Opposite sides have the same lengths:  side AD = side BC  side AB = side CD  Diagonals of a Parallelogram  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two side-by-side triangles.  As shown in the picture below, diagonal AC forms equal alternate interior angles with each pair of parallel sides.  We can also see that there are two triangles in the picture below.  Triangle 1 is congruent to triangle 2 by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Method.  Where did the two triangles come from?  They were formed by diagonal AC.  I should also note that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other as shown in the picture below.  AE = EC  where E is the midpoint of BOTH diagonals.  Example:  In parallelogram WXYZ, the measure of angle X = 4a - 40 and the measure of angle Z | Question: The internal angles of a quadrilateral add up to how many degrees?", ['360'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5362'), ('Context: M*A*S*H TV series characters - Monster M*A*S*H - WikiaM*A*S*H TV series characters | Monster M*A*S*H | Fandom powered by Wikia  M*A*S*H TV series characters  971pages on  Share  A group photo of MASH personnel. Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.  In 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.  On February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother’s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil\'s people", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "scharfe Barmherzigkeit" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames."

Presidents have entertained visiting heads of state, such a former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , conducted cabinet meetings, and briefed Congressional leaders at the retreat. The 1978 Middle East peace talks concluded with what have become known as the Camp David Accords. Yet few Americans know much about the place, considering its prominence.  Federal Summer Camp  It all started in 1935, when the Work Projects Administration , WPA, began building the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area Project near Thurmont, Maryland, as an example of creating parks from worn-out agricultural land.  Three years later, the area opened as a camp for federal government employees and their families. Known as Hi-Catoctin, the facility consisted of several small cabins, a dining hall, and a swimming pool. Covered with trees and 1,800 feet above sea level, the spot provided a cool respite from the near tropical humidity of the Washington, DC, area.  Meanwhile, immediately after America's entry into World War II, doctors for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt were urging the ailing president to find a place convenient to Washington, yet far enough away to escape the heat and political pressures of the city.  The presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was out of the question because of heightened security considerations imposed by the war. After a search committee considered two other sites on Furnace Mountain on the Virginia side of the Potomac River below Harper's Ferry; and Shenandoah National Park, Virginia; Roosevelt toured two sites in the Catoctin Mountains.  He picked Hi-Catoctin, issuing a set of instructions on how the buildings should be remodeled and asking for the construction of a main lodge, which resembled the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. The initial work cost $25,000. The camp was renamed the USS Shangri La, to follow up on the nautical connection, since many workers involved with the Potomac worked on the camp.  Popular Presidential Choice  Since Roosevelt inaugurated Shangri-La with a three-day visit beginning July 18, 1942, all subsequent presidents have made extensive use of the mountain top retreat.  President Harry Truman did not visit Shangri-La often because Bess, his wife, felt it was dull. However, when they did visit, the Trumans enjoyed Shangri-La. Truman's favorite sport was walking and he spent long hours wandering the mountain trails with a secret service agent in tow.  Renamed Camp David  President Dwight Eisenhower changed the name of the retreat to Camp David in honor of his grandson, David Eisenhower. Although he and his wife, Mamie, tended to use Camp David for private relaxation, Eisenhower held the first cabinet meeting ever to take place there. He also hosted British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David.  President John Kennedy and his family visited the camp often, enjoying the horseback riding and other recreational opportunities. Kennedy also allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use Camp David when he was not there.  President Lyndon Johnson held several important discussions with advisers on the Vietnam War, the crisis in the Dominican Republic, and other world events, at Camp David and hosted Prime Minister and Mrs. Harold Holt of Australia.  Reconstruction and Improvements  President Richard Nixon used Camp David as much as his five predecessors combined. Nixon had several new buildings built in compatible architectural styles, but complete with modern conveniences. He held cabinet meetings, staff conferences, hosted foreign dignitaries, and family get togethers at Camp David.  President Gerald Ford rode around Camp David on a snowmobile, and hosted President and Mrs. Suharto of Indonesia.

As an adolescent she attended a Catholic seminary for girls in Virginia, but at sixteen she married John Surratt, at least ten years her senior, and in 1840 settled with him in Prince George’s County, Maryland. In the early years of their marriage the Surratts prospered as a result of John’s success as a planter, which allowed him to expand his land holdings and open a general store and tavern, making up the core of the community that came to be known as Surrattsville (now Clinton). In 1854, a post office was even established in town, with John as its first postmaster. John’s earlier achievements were undermined, however, by his excessive drinking, which led to neglect of his farm and crops and a steady decline in his fortunes. In August 1862, John died. The Surratts’ eldest son Isaac (b. 1841), having taken a job as a pony-express rider in Mexico, left Mary Surratt alone to care for her two younger children, Anna (b. 1843) and John, Jr. (b. 1844).  Surratt struggled to manage what remained of the family’s holdings in Surrattsville, but she found it increasingly difficult, not least of all because John, Jr. showed so little interest in helping on the farm. By fall 1864, Mary Surratt had moved with John, Jr. and Anna to a house on H Street in Washington, D.C., which her husband had purchased in 1853 and which she converted into a boardinghouse. Happily for the Surratts, the boardinghouse did quite well, with a small number of steady boarders and the constant flow of more transient traffic through the federal capital during the war.  As early as 1863, John Surratt, Jr. – a loyal Southerner like his late father – began serving the Confederacy as a courier. In connection with this work, and with his college studies, John brought a number of people home to H Street, some of whom would later become entangled in the assassination conspiracy. In the spring of 1863, John introduced his mother to a school chum named Louis Weichmann, who took up residence in the Surratt boardinghouse in November 1864. By January 1865, John had met and become good friends with the ardent secessionist and actor John Wilkes Booth. Subsequently Booth was a regular visitor to H Street as well. German immigrant and assassination co-conspirator George Atzerodt also stayed at the boardinghouse for a few days in February 1865, until Mary Surratt evicted him for excessive drinking. Posting as a Baptist preacher, Lewis Powell – later found guilty of the 14 April attack on Secretary of State William H. Seward – lodged at the Surratt boardinghouse for three days in March.  Surratt Tavern in Clinton, Maryland (formerly Surrattsville)  It was not long after the shooting at Ford’s Theater that government investigators first descended on the boardinghouse. At approximately 2:30 on the morning of 15 April, several officials arrived and demanded to search the house in connection with the murder of the President. It appears that these men were looking for John, Jr., whom they believed at the time to have been the one to assault Seward. On the evening of the 17th, two detectives and two army officers returned, this time to arrest Mary Surratt and the rest of the people remaining in the house (Weichmann had slipped out on the 15th and was arrested that day; other boarders, disturbed by the crowds gathering around the house, had moved out on the 16th). Of the five who were arrested, all were women, with the exception of Lewis Powell, who arrived in disguise at the last, and for him most inopportune, moment. John Surratt, Jr., was nowhere to be found, and Booth had already escaped across the Potomac.  Mary Surratt and the others were questioned intensively at the headquarters of General Christopher Augur, commander of the Union troops in the capital, | Question: Mary Surratt was executed having been found guilty of the conspiracy to assassinate who?', ['president lincoln', 'lincoln', 'president abraham lincoln', 'abraham lincoln', 'president abraham'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5810'), ('Context: Wrigley FieldWrigley Field is a baseball park on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States, which is the home of the Chicago Cubs, one of the city\'s two Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises.  Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: Rumpole of the Bailey - TV.comRumpole of the Bailey - Show News, Reviews, Recaps and Photos - TV.com  Rumpole of the Bailey  EDIT  Welcome to the Rumpole of the Bailey guide at TV.com.  Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."

Mortimer wrote each and every episode of the television series, and their subsequent novelizations. The show ran, off and on, for seventeen years, an incredible run, and inspired not just the short stories, but novels and two radio series. It was only in 1995, with the publication of the Rumpole and the Angel of Death collection, that Mortimer began writing original Rumpole stories (ie: not adapted from his own TV scripts).

It is one of the most important megalithic sites in Europe, known for the very high number of impressive prehistoric monuments found in the vicinity, and is situated on the Crach River, west of the small port of Vannes .  Introduction to Carnac  The ancient monuments feature numerous standing stones - at least 3000 are still standing - and various dolmens and menhirs and other ancient artefacts. The monuments were erected over a period of more than a thousand years, starting with neolithic man (another great prehistoric site, Stonehenge, was also constructed over a period of 1500 years, not \'all in one go\' as you might expect).  A large number of the alignments are now protected, and surrounded by fencing preventing access, which is a shame but necessary if they are to be preserved. There is also a substantial Museum of prehistory in the town.  Prehistoric terminology and ancient stone formations  No visit to Carnac would be complete without a knowledge of a few of the basics of prehistoric structure. (These terms will also help with the Visit Carnac section below).  The megalithic monuments are named from the Greek words mega (\'big\') and lithos (\'stones\'). These have different names according to type but the best known is the so-called "menhir" - a term of Breton origin, meaning stone (\'men\') and \'very high and stretched\' (\'hir\'). Normally the menhirs are not isolated but are aligned along a straight line and circle - in the second case they are called "Cromlechs", from the Breton "Crom" ( "circle") and "lech" ( "place"): so the "Cromlech" is a "place where the large stones are placed in a circle."  Besides the menhirs, another well-known monument is the \'Dolmen\'. The term means "stone table" (from the Breton \'dol\' (table) and \'men\' (stone). In practice this is a series of menhirs on top of which large stones are placed, forming a sort of room or tunnel. Another interesting aspect, next to menhirs and dolmens, is the \'tumulus’, or \'high lands\' (mounds of earth\'), found at some Cromlechs.  Visit Carnac  A tourist excursion though the monuments of Carnac should begin from the \'mound of Saint-Michel\' - a mound over 100 meters long, 35 wide and 10 metres high which protects several graves inside, where artefacts have been found dating back to 3500 BC.  Not far away you can see the famous alignment of \'Le Menech\', preceded by an oval cromlech over 100 meters in diameter and surrounded by 70 stones of one meter in height - the alignment of Le Menech heads toward the north-east, with eleven parallel lines monoliths. A Cromlech oval with a diameter of 90 meters, and close by the avenues of stone (1099 of them) are found along with a large dolmen.  An area of 240 meters divides it from the second alignment called \'Kermario\', (the "place of the dead"), which continues in the same direction with 10 parallel rows over a width of 100 meters and a length of over one kilometre, with over 1000 tall menhirs. Towards the north a giant menhir stands, known as the Giant Manius and to the south there is the Kerkado mound, which marks the beginning of the next alignment of Kerlescan, meaning the \'place of cremation\'.  This consists of more than 10 parallel rows of nearly 500 stones with different heights over a width of 140 meters followed by a semicircular cromlech approximately delimited by 40 monoliths. To the south is the so-called "Petit Menech", formed by about 100 stones. In total, there are almost 3,000 menhirs, but excavations have identified certain alignments now no longer visible, such | Question: What ancient monument and tourist attraction would you see at Carnac in northern France?', ['standing stones', 'menhirs', 'menhir'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4791'), ('Context: Franciscan | religious order | Britannica.comFranciscan | religious order | Britannica.com  religious order  Christianity  Franciscan, any member of a Christian religious order founded in the early 13th century by St. Francis of Assisi . The members of the order strive to cultivate the ideals of the order’s founder. The Franciscans actually consist of three orders. The First Order comprises priests and lay brothers who have sworn to lead a life of prayer, preaching, and penance. This First Order is divided into three independent branches: the Friars Minor (O.F.M.), the Friars Minor Conventual (O.F.M. Conv.), and the Friars Minor Capuchin (O.F.M. Cap.). The Second Order consists of cloistered nuns who belong to the Order of St. Clare (O.S.C.) and are known as Poor Clares (P.C.). The Third Order consists of religious and lay men and women who try to emulate Saint Francis’ spirit by performing works of teaching, charity, and social service. Strictly speaking, the latter order consists of the Third Order Secular , whose lay members live in the world without vows; and the Third Order Regular, whose members live in religious communities under vow. Congregations of these religious men and women are numerous all over the Roman Catholic world. The Franciscans are the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic church. They have contributed six popes to the church.  It was probably in 1207 that Francis felt the call to a life of preaching, penance, and total poverty. He was soon joined by his first followers, to whom he gave a short and simple rule of life. In 1209 he and 11 of his followers journeyed to Rome, where Francis received approval of his rule from Pope Innocent III . Under this rule, Franciscan friars could own no possessions of any kind, either individually or communally (i.e., as the property of the order as a whole). The friars wandered and preached among the people, helping the poor and the sick. They supported themselves by working and by begging food, but they were forbidden to accept money either as payment for work or as alms. The Franciscans worked at first in Umbria and then in the rest of Italy and abroad. The impact of these street preachers and especially of their founder was immense, so that within 10 years they numbered 5,000. Affiliated with them were the Franciscan nuns, whose order was founded at Assisi in 1212, by St. Clare , who was under the guidance of St. Francis. Clare and her followers were lodged by Francis in the Church of San Damiano, where they lived a severe life of total poverty. They later became known as the Poor Clares or the Order of St. Clare.  Similar Topics  Cistercian  During the first years of the Franciscans, the example of Francis provided their real rule of life, but, as the order grew, it became clear that a revised rule was necessary. After preparing a rule in 1221 that was found too strict, Francis, with the help of several legal scholars, unwillingly composed the more restrained final rule in 1223. This rule was approved by Pope Honorius III .  Even before the death of Francis in 1226, conflicts had developed within the order over the observance of the vow of complete poverty . The rapid expansion of the order’s membership had created a need for settled monastic houses, but it was impossible to justify these if Francis’ rule of complete poverty was followed strictly. Three parties gradually appeared: the Zealots , who insisted on a literal observance of the primitive rule of poverty affecting communal as well as personal poverty; the Laxists, who favoured many mitigations; and the Moderates, or the Community , who wanted a legal structure that would permit some form of communal possessions. Something of an equilibrium was reached between these different schools of thought while St. Bonaventure was minister general (1257–74). Sometimes called the second founder of the order, he provided a wise, moderate interpretation of the rule. During this period the friars spread throughout Europe, while missionaries penetrated Syria and Africa.

The History Learning Site , 5 Mar 2015. 20 Oct 2016.  Medieval England experienced few revolts but the most serious was the Peasants’ Revolt which took place in June 1381. A violent system of punishments for offenders was usually enough to put off peasants from causing trouble. Most areas in England also had castles in which soldiers were garrisoned, and these were usually enough to guarantee reasonable behaviour among medieval peasants.  An army of peasants from Kent and Essex marched on London. They did something no-one had done before or since – they captured the Tower of London. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the King’s Treasurer were killed. The king, Richard II, was only 14 at the time but despite his youth, he agreed to meet the peasants at a place called Mile End.  What were the peasants angry about and why had they come to London ?  1. After the Black Death , many manors were left short of workers. To encourage those who had survived to stay on their manor, many lords had given the peasants on their estates their freedom and paid them to work on their land. Now, nearly 35 years after the Black Death, many peasants feared that the lords would take back these privileges and they were prepared to fight for them.  2. Many peasants had to work for free on church land, sometimes up to two days in the week. This meant that they could not work on their own land which made it difficult to grow enough food for their families. Peasants wanted to be free of this burden that made the church rich but them poor. They were supported in what they wanted by a priest called John Ball from Kent.  3. There had been a long war with France. Wars cost money and that money usually came from the peasants through the taxes that they paid. In 1380, Richard II introduced a new tax called the Poll Tax. This made everyone who was on the tax register pay 5p. It was the third time in four years that such a tax had been used. By 1381, the peasants had had enough. 5p to them was a great deal of money. If they could not pay in cash, they could pay in kind, such as seeds, tools etc., anything that could be vital to survival in the coming year.  In May 1381, a tax collector arrived at the Essex village of Fobbing to find out why the people there had not paid their poll tax. He was thrown out by the villagers. In June, soldiers arrived to establish law and order. They too were thrown out as the villagers of Fobbing had now organised themselves and many other local villages in Essex had joined them. After doing this, the villagers marched on London to plead with the young king to hear their complaints.  One man had emerged as the leader of the peasants – Wat Tyler from Kent. As the peasants from Kent had marched to London, they had destroyed tax records and tax registers. The buildings which housed government records were burned down. They got into the city of London because the people there had opened the gates to them.  By mid-June the discipline of the peasants was starting to go. Many got drunk in London and looting took place. It is known that foreigners were murdered by the peasants. Wat Tyler had asked for discipline amongst those who looked up to him as their leader. He did not get it.  On June 14th, the king met the rebels at Mile End. At this meeting, Richard II gave the peasants all that they asked for and asked that they go home in peace. Some did. Others returned to the city and murdered the archbishop and Treasurer – their heads were cut off on Tower Hill by the Tower of London. Richard II spent the night in hiding in fear of his life.  On June 15th, he met the rebels again at Smithfield outside of the city’s walls.

This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen . In humans , aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate . In aerobic conditions , the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate ( pyruvic acid ) , generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP . Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced , however , two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase . The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity ( decrease its stability ) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase . During the pay - off phase of glycolysis , four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate - level phosphorylation to make four ATP , and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized .

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ("Context: On July 3 , 2013 , after the box office success of the first film , Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer confirmed that there would be a sequel to the film , with production beginning in 2014 for an unspecified release date .

She was from Egypt,\xa0never fully accepted into the tribe.  Sarah may be a short version of Ummu-sarra, ‘the great mother is queen’.  Abraham means ‘ancestor of many people’.  Ishmael means ‘God hears’.\xa0Hagar was lost twice, but\xa0God heard her cry for help.  Note: At the beginning of the story of Hagar, Sarah and Abraham are called Sarai and Abram; later in the story, God makes a promise to them, a covenant, and changes their names to Sarah and Abraham. To minimize confusion,\xa0‘Sarah’ and ‘Abraham’ are used throughout.  Main themes of the story  Nothing is impossible to God. God had promised Abraham he would be the father of many nations, so when Sarah became post-menopausal she looked for ways to make this happen. She did not trust in God enough to leave the matter in His hands.  The foundation of the Arab nations.  According to the Koran, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael were ancestors of the Arab nations, and of the prophet Mohammed. The Koran says it was at Mecca that God saved Hagar and her son from death by thirst. Muslim ritual reflects this: every year for thirteen centuries Muslims performing the Hajj have retraced Hagar’s steps as she desperately searched for water.  Hagar represents women in the Bible who are excluded or despised. This might happen because they are childless in a society that valued mothers (as Sarah was at first) or a slave in a hierarchical society (as Hagar was at first).  Mother and beloved child  The story has two episodes:  1 The conception and birth of Hagar’s son Ishmael ( Genesis 16:1-16 ). Hagar was an Egyptian slave girl in the tribe of Abraham. She belonged to Sarah, the alpha female of the tribe. When Sarah could not conceive she gave Hagar to her husband as a surrogate. Hagar became pregnant, and God promised that her child would be the ancestor of a great nation. She bore a son, Ishmael.  2 The expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael ( Genesis 21:1-21 ). Hagar was never fully accepted into the tribe despite being the mother of Abraham’s child, and in the end she was rejected completely and expelled into the desert. But God protected her twice from Sarah’s hatred by sending an angel, and eventually Hagar lived as a free woman, not a slave.  See MAPS OF BIBLE LANDS for the location of this story  Hagar —\xa0victim? or upwardly mobile?  Read Genesis 16:1-16  The story of Hagar took place during the late Bronze Age between 2000 and 1550BC, corresponding to the Middle Kingdom period in Egyptian history.  Hagar was an Egyptian girl who was a slave in the household of Sarah, a Hebrew princess. Sarah may have acquired Hagar as part of the generous bride-price paid to her husband Abraham by Pharaoh in Egypt (this story is in Genesis 12:10-20 ).  Ancient wall painting of beautiful Egyptian women  It was an accepted practice at the time to give servants and slaves as part of the dowry of a wealthy young woman. If Hagar was a gift from Pharaoh, she was probably an accomplished servant with valuable skills. Becoming the servant of a nomadic tribeswoman may have been a step down socially for her.  You might take a look at Egyptian love poems in Women in the Bible: the story of Potiphar’s Wife: it will give you some idea of the comparative sophistication of the Egyptians.  Hagar was always disadvantaged among the Hebrew women because she was a foreigner and a slave. This was ironic, since she came from a land that was socially and politically advanced and possessed cities, temples and elaborate burial sites. Egypt had a complex economic system that regulated trade and commerce throughout its empire, and its theology and religion were sophisticated and well ordered.

Monet began the paintings in January or early February 1892. He visited Rouen on three occasions and completed 20 views of Rouen Cathedral between March 1892 and Feb-April 1893.  Monet in the \'90s: the Series Paintings  Average Customer Review: 4.7 out of 5 stars See all reviews (3 customer reviews)  This is an important and critically acclaimed book for all those wanting to study Monet and his series paintings.  Paul Hayes Tucker is the leading expert on Monet in the USA. This book locates the series paintings within the context of their time. Tucker looks at the development of his art before the 1890s and the cultural pressures of the 1880s that caused Monet to turn to serial painting.  He focuses on the major and minor series of paintings from the 1890s - including the paintings of Rouen Cathedral - and examines how they were painted and how they were received.  “To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor. What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me."  — Claude Monet  About Rouen Cathedral  Rouen Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral in Rouen, in northwestern France.  It\'s the seat of the Archbishop of Rouen and the building of Notre dame Cathedral started in 1200 and contains nearly the entire history of the Gothic style over a period of some 400 years. In the middle ages it\'s also where the kings of France were crowned.  Rouen is also situated some 60 kilometres from Giverny and is a city which Monet - and the French - knew well.  When looked at from the perspective of his paintings prior to 1892, the important thing to note is that he had never before before focused on one building or architectural element or even painted one motif as often as he did with Rouen Cathedral and its facades.  It\'s maybe important to note that Turner - the other great painter of atmosphere and light - had also created an engraving of Rouen Cathedral as part of his series on River Scenery in France.  The novelty of working with one motif meant that it became imbued with meaning. Hayes Tucker points to the religious revival in France in the 1890s and the fact that a Gothic Cathedral was a distinctly French symbol. Importantly Gothic was perceived in the 1890s as being symbolic  "Rouen Cathedral, West Facade, Sunlight" by Claude Monet | Source  Rouen and its Cathedral - background - articles on Wikipedia  map of Rouen Cathedral and the places where Monet painted  Monet\'s paintings of Rouen Cathedral - displayed as a series  Location and Dates  The Location  Monet\'s home area is Normandy.

Only one pane of 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in all philately. A single Inverted Jenny was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in November 2007 for $977,500. In December 2007 a mint never hinged example was sold for $825,000. The broker of the sale said the buyer was a Wall Street executive who had lost the auction the previous month.  A block of four inverted Jennys was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in October 2005 for $2.7 million.  In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, prices fetched by Inverted Jennys have receded. Between January and September 2014, five examples offered at auction sold for sums ranging from $126,000 through $575,100.  Prices seem since to have recovered, for on May 31, 2016, a particularly well-centered Jenny invert, graded XF-superb 95 by Professional Stamp Experts, was sold for at a Siegel Auction for a hammer price of $1,175,000   The addition of a 15% buyer’s premium raised the total record high price paid for this copy to $1,351,250.  Background  During the 1910s, the United States Post Office had made a number of experimental trials of carrying mail by air. These were shown by the first stamp in the world to picture an airplane (captioned as "aeroplane carrying mail"), one of the U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 1912–13.  The Post Office finally decided to inaugurate regular service on May 15, 1918, flying between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The Post Office set a controversial rate of 24 cents for the service, much higher than the 3 cents for first-class mail of the time, and decided to issue a new stamp just for this rate, patriotically printed in red and blue, and depicting a Curtiss Jenny JN-4HM, the biplane especially modified for shuttling the mail. The stamp\'s designer, Clair Aubrey Houston, apparently troubled to procure a photograph of that modified model (produced by removing the second pilot seat from the JN-4HT to create space for mailbags, and by increasing the fuel capacity). As only six such aircraft existed, there was a 1-in-6 chance that the very plane engraved on the stamp by Marcus Baldwin—Jenny #38262—would be chosen to launch the inaugural three-city airmail run; the plane on the stamp was indeed the first to depart on May 15th, taking off from Washington at 11:47 A. M.   The job of designing and printing the new stamp was carried out in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.  Many collectors long thought the blue plane portion was printed first, thus it was actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first and it is the planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, it can be seen that the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

Below, we give you a sample of how our writer\'s have explained the circles of hell in the Inferno.  Dante’s Inferno is the first part of his epic poem The Divine Comedy , written between 1308 and 1321. The word “Inferno” is Italian for “Hell,” and this part of the work describes the poet’s allegorical journey through the nine circles of Hell. On this journey he is guided by the Roman poet Virgil.  The poem opens with the poet lost in the woods, chased by three beasts, and falling into a deep place. Virgil, who tells Dante that he has been sent by his beloved, deceased Beatrice, rescues him.  The two thus begin their journey through Hell . Each circle is an allegory , frequently representing poetic justice. The first circle of Hell is Limbo, where the unbaptized and virtuous pagans reside. Here Dante meets Homer , Ovid, Cicero and many famous figures from antiquity.  Hell and Dante\'s Inferno  The second circle of Hell is Lust, where the souls of carnal sinners are blackened by an endless wind. In the third circle, Gluttony, a giant worm forces those condemned to lie in a foul mud. These individuals are unaware of their neighbors, indicative of the selfish nature of this sin . The fourth circle, greed, is home to many popes and cardinals, forced to push great weights with their chests.  Wrath, the fifth circle, has sinners fighting each other in the River Styx. Beyond this are the walls of Dis, which separate the deepest pits of Hell, where active (rather than passive) sinners are sent. Heresy, Violence, Fraud and Treachery are the innermost circles of the Inferno.  The City of Dis serves as the gateway to the Nether Hell, separating those guilty of sin by | Question: What Italian author envisioned 9 circles of hell?', ['alighieri', 'dante', 'dante alighieri'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3847'), ("Context: NCIS : New Orleans follows a fictional team of Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) agents stationed out of New Orleans , Louisiana and led by Special Agent Dwayne Cassius Pride ( Scott Bakula ) .

According to Exodus , the pillar of fire provided light so that the Israelites could travel by night during the Exodus from Egypt ( perhaps at the time of the 18th Dynasty ; see dating of the Exodus ) . Scripture traditionally pairs a pillar of fire with the manifestation of the divine presence by day as the Pillar of Cloud . The combination meant that the Children of Israel `` could travel by day or night '' . YHWH , the God of the Bible , manifested himself in this pillar of fire or cloud in order to directly guide and comfort the Israelites while he rescued them from their Egyptian slavery . Throughout the Israelite 's time in the desert , traveling from Egypt to Canaan ( the Promised Land ) , YHWH continually used this pillar of fire and cloud to lead his people and to remind them of his presence . When the pillar of God moved forward , the people of Israel would pack up their camp and follow behind it . Similarly , when the pillar of God 's presence stopped , the Israelites would set up camp underneath it . The Levites would set up the Tabernacle of the Lord directly underneath the cloud of the Lord . This way , God 's presence was visibly in the center of the camp at all times .

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

Belfast West was the fourth by-election held since the 2010 General Election. There were 6 candidates on the ballot paper.  The by-election was called after the former MP, Gerry Adams, vacated his seat.  UKPollingReport Election Guide 2010 » West BelfastUKPollingReport Election Guide 2010 » West Belfast  Workers: 32 (0.1%)  Majority: 19315 (56.6%)  Boundary Changes: Gains Dunmurry ward and part of Derriaghy ward – uniquely in the whole of the boundary review, this leavies Derriaghy divided between two different constituencies.  Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).  Current MP: Paul Maskey (Sinn Fein) Born 1969. Belfast councillor 2001-2009. MLA for Belfast West since 2007.  2011 By-election.  Gerry Adams resigned from the Commons on the 26th January 2011 in order to contest the seat of Louth in the Republic of Ireland general election. Adams initially refused to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds or manor of Northstead, instead attempting to resign by writing to the Speaker. He was subsequently appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead. The by-election was held on the 9th June and was a easy hold for Sinn Fein.  By-election candidates:  Paul Maskey (Sinn Fein) Born 1969. Belfast councillor 2001-2009. MLA for Belfast West since 2007.  Alex Attwood (SDLP) Born 1959, Belfast. Educated at Queens University.

Originally , the winners kept it until a new champion was crowned . Currently , winning teams get the Stanley Cup during the summer and a limited number of days during the season . It is unusual among trophies to include winning members ' names . Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted . Between 1924 and 1940 , a new band was added almost every year the trophy was awarded , earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup '' due to the unnatural height of all the bands . In 1947 the cup size was reduced , but not all the large rings were the same size . In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom . It has been referred to as The Cup , Lord Stanley 's Cup , The Holy Grail , or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug .

Border disputes between the new state and Mexico , which had never recognized Texas independence and still considered the area a renegade Mexican state , led to the Mexican -- American War ( 1846 -- 1848 ) . When the war concluded , Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas , as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States . Texas ' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery .

The Declaration was directly influenced by Thomas Jefferson , working with General Lafayette , who introduced it . Influenced also by the doctrine of `` natural right '' , the rights of man are held to be universal : valid at all times and in every place , pertaining to human nature itself . It became the basis for a nation of free individuals protected equally by the law . It is included in the beginning of the constitutions of both the Fourth French Republic ( 1946 ) and Fifth Republic ( 1958 ) and is still current .

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders. | Question: What needs to be larger to get the same work out of lower pressure steam?', ['cylinder volume', 'cylinder'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3344'), ("Context: `` My Town '' is a song written by Reed Nielsen and Jeffrey Steele and recorded by American country music duo Montgomery Gentry .

Published on Jan 2, 2009  One  wonderful  waltz  of   Johann Strauss  Johann Strauss II (October 25, 1825 -- June 3, 1899; also known as fully Johann Baptist Strauss, and Johann Strauss, Jr. was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

The 12 animals that appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar include a rat, buffalo (ox), tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. It’s an unusual combination of animals for sure, and their appearance on the Chinese Zodiac is the topic of countless legends and is deeply embedded in Chinese mythology.  An unlikely gathering  The most well-known of the Chinese zodiac legends states that Buddha invited the animals to participate in a race. The prize was a coveted position on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. The first 12 animals to cross the river would appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar in the order in which they completed the race.  The first animal to make it across the finish line according to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology was the rat. It seems unlikely that such a small animal could win such a strenuous race, especially when one considers all the contenders.  Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology explains that the rat used his brain rather than his brawn. It hitched a ride on what it perceived was the mightiest swimmer. Just before the buffalo reached the shore, the rat jumped off the buffalo’s back and crossed the finish line before the buffalo, putting the rat in first place.  The buffalo came in second and as promised in the legends and mythology, was the second animal listed on the Chinese Zodiac. The tiger, also being strong, came in third, followed by the rabbit that jumped his way across and was helped during the last stretch by the dragon. A snake hid in the hoof of the horse which is how it managed to make it across the river. At the last minute the snake jumped out and scared the horse into seventh place.  The sheep, monkey and rooster helped one another across and earned their spots on the calendar as well. The dog made it too, but decided a bath was more important than the position which is why it came in eleventh. Finally, the pig appeared and is listed last. According to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology, the pig feasted and rested half-way through the race, but made it across guaranteeing its position.  A small gathering  The history of the Chinese Zodiac weaves another intriguing tale. This one tells of an invitation to a grand feast. All the animals were invited to join Buddha at either a birthday celebration, a New Year celebration, or a celebration for his departure from this world. Only 12 animals showed up at the festivities and that’s how they ended up being featured on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. Another of the legends of the Chinese Zodiac states that instead of Buddha, it was the Jade Emperor who invited the animals.  Regardless of the specific version of Chinese Zodiac history to which you subscribe, the Chinese Zodiac has amazed and entertained people around the world for thousands of years.

Evidence has been dug up that this root plant originated in Afghanistan. Over the centuries traders traveling through the region picked up carrot seeds there and carried them along the trade routes of Arabia, Africa, and Asia, selling them in regions anxious to cultivate new and productive plants. Even in the early days there were many varieties of carrots, coming in an assortment of colors - purple, white, black, and red but, surprisingly, not orange!  Carrots spread over the civilized world and have even been found in Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh\'s tombs. Drawings found in Egyptian temples are thought by Egyptologists to be a purple variety of carrots 1 .  Both the ancient Greeks and the Romans were familiar with carrots, although these early varieties were not the sweet, succulent orange carrots that are grown today. Early carrots were typically not often eaten as food by the Greeks, but were used for medicinal purposes. The Romans were known to have eaten both raw and cooked carrots accompanied with an olive oil dressing containing different herbs. Like many other plants, at various times in ancient societies, carrots were thought to be an aphrodisiac.  Carrots began to be cultivated in Europe by the 13th century (1200s), with many doctors prescribing carrots for medicinal purposes for ailments as varied as syphilis and animal bites! The Medieval Europeans were very much in awe of the ancients and inclined to borrow heavily from them.  Carrots were well-known to 16th century botanists and writers, who described red and purple varieties in France, and yellow and red varieties in England. The Dutch cross-bred the yellow and red carrot to produce a variety that was the emblematic color of the House of Orange. This carrot quickly became popular and was further developed to become the sweet, succulent orange carrot which is the most recognized color of carrot used throughout the world today 2 .  Carrots arrived in Australia in 1788 and became an important food for the colonists. The Carrot Museum reveals that the carrot was introduced to America in 1609. In 1871 America developed its first carrot. It is called the Danvers carrot from its origins in Danvers, MA. However, the carrot did not become popular in the U.S. until after World War I (1914-1918) when "doughboys" returning from the war had been exposed to the carrot in French and other European cuisine. 3  In the Second World War carrots were promoted by the British government and became one of the staple foods in England. People were encouraged grow carrots in their gardens and to cook them in different ways. They were incorporated into both sweet and savory dishes. Growing this crop during troubled times helped people get sufficient amounts of nutritious food to eat in times of food scarcity and rationing.  Red and yellow varieties of carrot are eaten in China and Japan; with the purple carrot becoming increasingly popular in different states in America. There are also \'rainbow\' carrots on the market. However, a single carrot is not multi-colored, the name comes from bags containing red, yellow, purple and orange carrots.  History of Carrots - A brief summary and timelineOrange and red  Sources - Rubatzsky and Banga. Also Carrot Museum\'s Curator      research material Reference material is here.  Notes: Red was often confused with purple.\xa0 Orange      carrots may have been around well before 1100 - see here . The above listing is a "best guess" as there is much conflicting evidence.  Carrots were also probably White throughout these periods,      often confused with Parsnips (also white).      There was (and still is!) enormous confusion when trying to sort out the individual histories of carrots and parsnips. The Latin name      for the parsnip genus is      thought to come from,      meaning "food". This would further explain the historical confusion of the      two vegetables, as well as offer a testament to how important they both were in      the ancient diet.

The treaty forced Germany to disarm , make substantial territorial concessions , and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers .

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Frank Sinatra  Francis Albert Sinatra ( ; ] ; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century.  He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide.  Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey.  Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the "bobby soxers".  He released his debut album, "The Voice of Frank Sinatra", in 1946.  Sinatra\'s professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack.  His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of "From Here to Eternity", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including "In the Wee Small Hours" (1955), "Songs for Swingin\' Lovers!

Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  Potassium  The name is derived from the english word potash. The chemical symbol K comes from kalium, the Mediaeval Latin for potash, which may have derived from the arabic word qali, meaning alkali.  Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart. Potassium is silvery when first cut but it oxidizes rapidly in air and tarnishes within minutes, so it is generally stored under oil or grease. It is light enough to float into water with which it reacts instantly to release hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame.  The chemistry of potassium is almost etirely that of the potassium ion, K+.  Applications  Most potassium (95 %) goes into fertilizers and the rest goes mainly into making potassium hydroxide (KOH), by the electrolysis of potassium chloride solution, and then converting this to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Potassium carbonate goes into glass manufacture, expecially the glass used to make televisions, while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soaps and detergents. A little potassium chloride goes into pharmaceuticals, medical drips and saline injections.  Other potassium salts are used in baking, photography and tanning leather, and to make iodize salts. In all cases it is the negative anion, not the potassium, which is the key to their use.  Potassium in the environment  Most potassium occurs in the Earth\'s crust as minerals, such as feldspars and clays. Potassium is leached from these by weathering, which explains why there is quite a lot of this element in the sea (0.75 g/liter).  Minerals mined for their potassium are pinkish and sylvite, carnallite and alunite. The main mining area used to be Germany, which had a monopoly of potassium before the first World War. Today most potassium minerals come from Canada, USA and Chile. The world production of potassim ores is about 50 million tonnes, and reserves are vast (more than 10 billion tonnes).  Potassium is a key plant element. Although it is soluble in water, little is lost from undisturbed soils because as it is released from dead plants and animal excrements, it quickly become strongly bound to clay particles, and it is retained ready to be readsorbed by the roots of other plants.  Health effects of potassium  Potassium can be found in vegetables, fruit, potatoes, meat, bread, milk and nuts. It plays an important role in the physical fluid system of humans and it assists nerve functions. Potassium, as the ion K+, concnetrate inside cells, and 95% of the body\'s potassium is so located. When our kidneys are somehow malfunctioning an accumulation of potassium will consist. This can lead to disturbing heartbeats.  Potassium can effect you when breathed in. Inhalation of dust or mists can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, lungs with sneezing, coughing and sore throat. Higher exposures may cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, this can cause death. Skin and eye contact can cause severe burns leading to permanent damage.

The Kalahari is a massive area of semi-arid savanna covering parts of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.  The Kalahari Desert in Namibia.  5. Description  The Kalahari Desert stretches across an area of 900,000 square kilometers, in the three African countries of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. Up to 70% of the land in Botswana, the eastern third of Namibia, and the northernmost parts of South Africa are all occupied by this desert. The Kalahari, unlike a true desert, has a semi-arid climate that supports vast tracts of sandy savanna, and a considerable diversity of flora and fauna lives therein. The landscape of the Kalahari is mostly flat, with an average elevation of around 1,000 meters above sea level in most parts of the desert. The Boteti River, in Botswana, is the only permanent surface water source in the desert.  4. Historical Role  Scientists estimate that the Kalahari Desert was formed between 65 and 135 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period. Since then, the desert has faced both periods of higher precipitation and greater aridity than the present prevailing conditions. It is possible that the dry riverbeds of the Kalahari and the Makgadikgadi Depression were formed during such periods of higher precipitation. Historical evidence proves that the San Bushmen of Africa were the ancient occupants of the Kalahari Desert region. The Bantu people, including tribes like the Tswana, the Kgalagadi, and the Herero, are currently residents of the desert along with the traditional San people, and these others arrived much later, towards the end of the 18th Century. In 1849, David Livingstone, a Scottish medical missionary, and William C. Oswell, an English explorer, were the first Europeans to cross the Kalahari Desert. In more recent years, Europeans arrived in the Kalahari primarily for commercial purposes, and only a single European settlement (in the Ghanzi District) existed in the region as late as the 1890’s.  3. Modern Significance  Presently, the Kalahari Desert serves as the homeland for Bantu-speaking African tribes and the Khoisan-speaking San people. The vast stretches of savanna in the region allow the locals to rear cattle and goats for meat and milk. Corn, sorghum, and pumpkins are also cultivated by most households in the region. The Kalahari Desert is home to large deposits of precious metals and diamonds. The first diamond mine was opened here in Orapa in 1971. Tourism also adds to the economy of the region. Besides the economical significance of the Kalahari, the desert is also extremely significant from the ecological and environmental points of view. The sands of the desert are packed with cyanobacteria which can fix atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus acting as a natural carbon sink for much of the world. The desert also houses some rare and endangered animals in its game reserves, including the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the Khutse Game Reserve, and the Kgalagadi Trans-frontier Park.  2. Habitat and Biodiversity  While the southwestern half of the Kalahari meets the requirements to be qualified as a desert, the northeastern portion of it receives a significant amount of precipitation, and thus cannot qualify as a true desert. There are great diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature throughout the Kalahari. While in summers day temperatures range between 43° and 46° Celsius, and night temperatures fall to between 21 degrees and 27° Celsius, in winters night temperatures can be as low as -12° Celsius. The arid areas of the southwestern Kalahari Desert support very little plant life, and are covered by vast stretches of xeric savanna comprised by xerophytic plants like savanna grasses, grey camelthorn, shepherd’s trees, and silver cluster-leafs. Several species of acacia grow in the less arid, central Kalahari region as well. The more humid northern parts of the desert, however, have large woodlands, palm trees, and even forests with evergreen and deciduous trees. Lions, cheetahs, giraffes, zebras, elephants, leopards, meerkats, and antelopes are just some of the mammalian species found in the northern Kalahari Desert | Question: The Kalahari Desert lies chiefly in which country?', ['botswana'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5997'), ('Context: PsychoanalysisPsychoanalysis is a set of psychological and psychotherapeutic theories and associated techniques, created by Austrian physician Sigmund Freud and stemming partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others.   Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ("Context: `` No Taxation Without Representation '' is a slogan originating during the 1750s and 1760s that summarized a primary grievance of the American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies , which was one of the major causes of the American Revolution .

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

The bright star Alnitak (ζ Ori), the easternmost star        in the Belt of Orion, shines energetic ultraviolet light        into the Flame and this knocks electrons away from the        great clouds of hydrogen gas that reside there. Much of        the glow results when the electrons and ionized hydrogen        recombine. Additional dark gas and dust lies in front of        the bright part of the nebula and this is what causes        the dark network that appears in the center of the        glowing gas.

A:  Quick Answer  In the Greek mythology story of Theseus and the Minotaur, King Minos of Crete ordered the labyrinth to be built as a way of housing a fierce half-man, half-bull creature known as the Minotaur, to whom seven young men and seven young women from Athens would be sacrificed each year. According to the myth, the labyrinth is a massive maze-like structure built by a man named Daedalus at the behest of King Minos; the maze that Daedalus constructed was so incredibly complex that even he could barely make his way through it. The hero Theseus ends up offering himself as a tribute to be sacrificed in the labyrinth, though his intention is to kill the Minotaur or die trying.

Europa's husband was the king of Crete, Asterion, who looked over the boys as he his own. \xa0The three sons were Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus.\xa0These three men, after death were made judge in the underworld.

But it was Minos whose name actually means king, who was fated to be king of Crete. \xa0But Minos' \xa0ascension to power was a difficult journey, he competed for the kingship of Crete with his brothers.

This confirmed to all concerned that Minos was their true king. When Minos saw the beautiful white bull, he refused to sacrifice it to Poseidon and replace it with another.\xa0Angered with Minos, Poseidon plotted to punish him for his arrogance. So Poseidon turned the bull wild and\xa0implanted sexual desire \xa0towards bull in\xa0 Pasiphae (wife of Minos).\xa0Pasiphae mated with bull and gave birth to\xa0Asterius, who was called Minotaur (Minotaur was a monster half man and half bull).\xa0  Pasiphae and the Bull  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Pasiphae nursed Minotaur, but he grew and became ferocious, being the unnatural offspring of a woman and a beast, he had no natural source of nourishment and thus devoured man for sustenance.

Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, to a wealthy Baptist family;[1] his maternal grandfather, James Omar "J.O." Cole, was a coal and timber speculator who dominated his daughter\'s family. His mother started Porter in musical training at an early age; he learned the violin at age six, the piano at eight, and he wrote his first operetta (with help from his mother) at 10. Porter\'s mother, Kate, recognized and supported her son\'s talents. She changed his legal birth year from 1891 to 1893 to make him appear more precocious. Porter\'s grandfather.

After the 1932 Lindbergh kidnapping,  Porter changed the second and third lines to:  Flying too high with some guy in the sky  Is my idea of nothing to do  In the 1936 movie version, alternative lyrics in the second verse were provided to replace a reference to the drug cocaine, which was not allowed by Hollywood\'s Production Code of 1934.

It was celebrated in ancient Rome as the festival of Flora, the goddess of flowers, plants and fertility.  The festival had a licentious character which continued into the various pagan festivals that occurred across Europe.  Particularly, in Germany, these celebrations were Christianised to honour St. Walpurgia who brought Christianity to Germany.1 Some of the older traditional May Day celebrations included the crowning of a May Queen, dancing around a May pole and the gathering of spring flowers for decoration.  In France the symbol of May 1st is lily-of-the-valley (muguet).  This usage dates back to 1561, when King Charles IX, then aged 10, gave a sprig of this flower as a good luck charm to the ladies of his court.  The custom was revived around 1900 and today giving lily-of-the-valley to friends and family is a tradition.  The government allows these flowers to be sold tax-free, so it is a popular way for charities and other groups to raise money. The flowers must be gathered in the wild, not bought and then re-sold for this tax benefit to be allowed. The wild rose is a secondary symbol of May Day and may also be collected.  May 1st as Labour Day  May Day has another side to it.  It is also known as La fï¿½te du travail - Labour Day - and is a public holiday when all stores and even public transit may be closed. In France all workers except the most essential have an absolute right by law to not work on this day.3  This connection with the labour movement began in 1889 at a meeting of the Second International in Paris.  The Second International was an organization of socialist and labour parties.  Four workers had been shot and killed by police on May 4th, 1886 in Chicago while demonstrating for the eight-hour week.3 Known as the Haymarket Affair, it became a cause cï¿½lï¿½bre among labour movements, and along with other disturbances during a period of great social unrest, led to the declaring of May 1st as International Labour Day.  In 1936, wide-spread demonstrations on May 1st led to the formation of the first centre-left government in France which quickly introduced the 40-hour work week, two weeks paid holiday and the right to form a union.  Since then the day has been a consistent focus of labour activity and demonstrations. In France labour unions organize marches, demonstration and parades across the country on this day to re-enforce their commitment to improved rights for workers.  The Catholic Church has declared May 1st as Saint Joseph the Worker Day (Saint Joseph's feast day is on March 19th).5 In the May Day aspect, St. Joseph, the wife of Mary, is the patron Saint of Workers.  Mary herself is also strongly associated with May Day in the celebration of its Spring Festival aspect. The Pope always makes a speech on May Day in support of the rights of workers and the fair value of labour.  When is May Day?  May Day in France always falls on May 1st.  If it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is also observed on that Saturday or Sunday, and there wouldn't be a Bank Holiday that year.  Labour Day 2017 – Public Holidays FranceLabour Day 2017 and 2018 — Public Holidays France  Tue  Labour Day  The holiday is celebrated annually on May 1.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ("Context: Early texts ( c. 2200 BC ) seem to indicate that Meluhha is to the east , suggesting either the Indus valley or India .

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including Mstislav III of Kiev, were put under this platform and crushed to death. | Question: Where did Jebe and Subutai spend the winter following the split of the Mongol army?", ['Russia', 'near the Black Sea', 'Black Sea'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6297'), ('Context: Many eukaryotes have the ability to synthesize carnitine , including humans .

Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate. | Question: Are juiveniles capable of reproduction?", ['juveniles are capable of reproduction', 'In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4637'), ('Context: Spike (TV network)Spike (formerly and popularly known as Spike TV) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Viacom Music and Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal\'s USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s.

With the growth of New Orleans as a city and the creolization of different cultures , the varied celebration of Mardi Gras became the event most strongly associated with the city . In more recent times , several U.S. cities without a French Catholic heritage have instituted the celebration of Mardi Gras , which sometimes emerged as grassroots movements to help accompany single people to celebrate something in late Winter which is often dominated by the commercialized and couple - centric Valentine 's Day , and as a result it has been co-opted as the single people 's late Winter holiday . | Question: where was the first mardi gras parade held ?", ['Mobile , Alabama'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-47895'), ('Context: Virginia Wade - International Tennis Hall of FameVirginia Wade  Virginia Wade  7-time major champion, 6-time finalist  Career Titles  Member of the British Wightman Cup Team 1965-1985  Member of the winning team 1968, 1974, 1975, 1978  Fed Cup  Member of the British Federation Cup Team 1967-1970, 1972-1983  Overall Record: 66-33  Virginia Wade WTA Profile  Citizenship: GBR Born: July 10, 1945               in Bournemouth, England Played: Right-handed  Virginia Wade chose the perfect time to become the first British female to win the Wimbledon Ladies Singles Championship in 8 years and the last to win since.  In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000. Wade only traveled to the Australian Open five times, but in 1972 stung another No. 1 seed when defeating crowd favorite and native Evonne Goolagong, who was in the midst of playing in seven consecutive Australian finals, | Question: Prior to Viginia Wade in 1977 who was the last British player to win a tennis Grand Slam title?', ['sue barker'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5406'), ('Context: A kitten , also known as a kitty or kitty cat , is a juvenile cat .

Nijinsky is still the only winner of the English Triple Crown since World War II. For many years, it was considered unlikely that any horse would ever win the English Triple Crown again. In the winter of 2006/2007, however, trainer Jim Bolger was training his unbeaten colt Teofilo for the Triple Crown [2] and bookmaker William Hill plc was offering odds of only 12/1 against Teofilo winning the 2007 Triple Crown. However, the horse was withdrawn from the 2000 Guineas two days before the race after suffering a setback.  Since Nijinsky, only Nashwan (1989), Sea the Stars (2009), and Camelot (2012) have won both the Guineas and the Derby, and in addition, no Derby winner (including both Nashwan and Sea the Stars) has even entered the St. Leger since Reference Point in 1987, although this is primarily due to the impact it would have on a horse's stud value, which would not be the case for a horse who had already won the Guineas.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens.

By Helen Brown  3:11PM GMT 24 Feb 2010  In the soil beneath Amsterdam’s Van Gogh museum waits a time capsule containing a set of the artist’s brushes – and the sheet music for Don McLean’s Vincent (Starry Starry Night). Museum staff play the song for visitors every day, although there’s no danger of it being forgotten. Indeed, it is likely to be the American singer’s powerful portrait of misunderstood genius that brought them there in the first place. The same is surely true for the thousands who are currently flocking to see the Royal Academy’s hugely popular exhibition The Real Van Gogh – The Artist and his Letters, which is shaping up to be one of the shows of the year.  Released on the classic 1971 album American Pie, Vincent became a No1 hit in the UK in 1972 and has gone on to influence an extraordinary range of musicians, covered by everyone from metal punks NOFX to Dame Julie Andrews to Rick Astley. Irish crooner Brian Kennedy sang it at George Best’s funeral and gangsta rapper Tupac Shakur loved it so much that, after he was fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting in 1996, his girlfriend slipped it into the tape deck beside his hospital bed to ensure it was the last thing he heard.  But what of the man who wrote it? American Pie was perhaps the high point of his career, but McLean is still going strong at 64, with a new album out in April and a tour of the UK beginning in May. I caught up with him over the phone at his home in Maine to find out how he was inspired to write Vincent and how he felt about its huge impact.  “In the autumn of 1970 I had a job singing in the school system, playing my guitar in classrooms,” he says. “I was sitting on the veranda one morning, reading a biography of Van Gogh, and suddenly I knew I had to write a song arguing that he wasn’t crazy. He had an illness and so did his brother Theo. This makes it different, in my mind, to the garden variety of 'crazy’ – because he was rejected by a woman [as was commonly thought]. So I sat down with a print of Starry Night and wrote the lyrics out on a paper bag.”  With its bittersweet palette of major and minor chords, Vincent’s soothing melody is one of high emotion recollected in tranquillity. The lyrical list of colours – the “swirling clouds in violet haze”, the eyes of “China blue” the “snowy linen land” – evoke a mental slide show of the artist’s work.  Related Articles  The Real Van Gogh  18 Jan 2010  The stop-start of McLean’s humble delivery pays homage to the stop-start brush strokes of its subject and capture the paintings’ sense of spontaneity, building toward the moment of high, romantic drama – the strum – when the artist takes his own life.  It begins almost abruptly – as if McLean is responding to an unheard voice. There’s no instrumental introduction: the vocal and guitar begin simultaneously: “Starry starry night/ paint your palette blue and grey/ look out on a summer’s day/ with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.” When McLean sings of the dead painter seeing into the darkness of his own soul, he’s asserting a kinship of creativity, a shared sensitivity to life’s beauty and pain.  Van Gogh painted the swirling, hyper real Starry Night, after committing himself to an asylum in St Remy in 1889. He wrote to Theo that he often felt the night to be “more richly coloured than the day”. He believed the souls of the dead dwelt in the heavens. “Just as we take the train to go to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death | Question: Who was Don McLean singing about in Vincent ?", ['vincent van gogh', 'vincent van gough', 'van gough', 'van gogh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7032'), ("Context: Offstage , Goneril , her plans thwarted , commits suicide .

Gold:  \xa0 South Korea  Summary  Although they had never won a gold medal at the Olympics, Brazil was favored to do so now. The squad featured top players like [Hulk], [Marcelo] and [Neymar] along with a host of talents, several of which had played when Brazil won the 2011 U-20 World Cup. Their chief opponents were expected to be Spain. They had won the European qualifier, their senior team had just won Euro 2012, and a few of those players also competed at the Olympics: [Javi Martínez], [Juan Mata] and [Jordi Alba]. Other contenders were the unknown British team – composed of English and Welsh players, featuring veteran star [Ryan Giggs] – and Mexico, which had placed third at the 2011 U-20 Worlds (runner-up Portugal didn't qualify). Four teams débuted at the Olympics: Belarus, Gabon, Senegal and United Arab Emirates.  The biggest surprise of the preliminaries was the elimination of Spain, which lost twice and drew once. The other favorites did proceed to the quarter-finals, where the hosts lost to South Korea on penalties. Brazil won 3-2 over tiny Honduras after being 1-2 down, while Mexico needed extra time against Senegal. The fourth semi-finalist was Japan, which ousted Egypt.  Both Japan and Mexico had only once before reached the semi-final stage of an Olympic football tournament, both in 1968, when the Japanese beat Mexico for the bronze. This time, the Central Americans proceeded despite an early lead through Japan's [Yuki Otsu]. South Korea, first-time Olympic semi-finalist, was too weak for the Brazilians, who proceeded into their third Olympic final.  Brazil was heavily favored for the gold, but the Mexicans delivered a sensitive blow only 28 seconds into the game, when [Oribe Peralta] struck after a defensive error. The Brazilians dominated most of the match, but were unable to seriously threaten the Mexican defense.

When I originally posted the treatment for a movie based on the un-filmed Bond novel (the film of the same name is not based on Ian Fleming’s novel) I promised a similar idea based on Moonraker. Better late than never here it is after three years.  So you think you know Moonraker? As the great Ross McG from Ross v Ross once said, ‘Oh, Star Wars is huge! Lets put Bond in space with Moonraker!’ That’s not far off the mark. But back in 1955, just ten years after World War II and during the Cold War Ian Flemings’s third Bond novel was very different. The only way this would work as a movie would be to reboot the series and set the movie in the 1950’s, something I have wanted to see for a long time.  M asks Bond to join him at his club, Blades to sit in a game of bridge. Millionaire businessman Sir Hugo Drax has been winning a lot of money, M suspects him of cheating and wants to know why. Bond confirms M’s suspicions and turns the tables by cheating himself winning a large sum of money.  The mysterious Drax was a British soldier who made his fortune in the aerospace industry after being injured and suffering amnesia during World War II. A national hero because of his backing for the Moonraker project, Britain’s first nuclear missile intended as a nuclear deterrent during the cold war. (Britain’s first nuclear missile the Blue Streak was actually announced around the time the novel was published). Bond is sent to Drax’s factory near Dover to replace security officer working on the project who was shot dead. While there he meets Gala Brand, a beautiful (isn’t everyone in the Bond world) Special Branch agent working undercover as Drax’s personal assistant. It appears Bonds predecessor was killed to stop him revealing a sighting of a submarine off the coast. Bond also makes the surprising discovery (remember this is only ten years after the war) that all the scientists working on the Moonraker project are German. Meanwhile, Gala discovers the truth about the Moonraker, its first test flight will be aimed at the heart of London fitted with a Soviet nuclear warhead. She is captured and imprisoned in the building containing a beacon the missile will be aimed at.  Bond’s attempt to rescue Gala fails resulting in his capture and the destruction of his beloved Bentley. It is then that Drax, in true megalomaniac villain style reveals is back-story and his plans: he was not a British soldier and did not have amnesia. He was the leader of the commando unit (dressed in British uniform) that caused the explosion he was injured in. The amnesia, a cover story while he recovered in a British hospital. After the war he took up a new identity as cover but retained his Nazi beliefs and conceived the Moonraker to destroy London in revenge. In the process he also intends to make a killing on the stock market. To destroy all evidence Brand and Bond are moved to the area under the Moonraker’s engines just before it is fired. They promptly escape and with the help of Soviet Intelligence change the coordinates to redirect the Moonraker safely into the sea. Drax is killed attempting to escape in a Russian submarine. Bond meets up with Gala but is snubbed in favour of he fiancé.  So how have I come up with such a great story? Put simply I haven’t, this is not a treatment for a movie this is an overview of the plot lifted straight from the novel. So who would make it? Director Quentin Tarantino has often mentioned his interest in directing a Bond film. If anyone can make the 50’s setting work it is him. And to reboot the series again we need a new bond.

Uranus  News  Uranus Facts  Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third largest (by diameter).        Uranus is larger in diameter but smaller in mass than Neptune  Planet Profile  orbit : 2,870,990,000 km (19.218 AU ) from Su  diameter : 51,118 km (equatorial)  Careful pronunciation may be necessary        to avoid embarrassment; say "YOOR\xa0a\xa0nus"\xa0  , not  "your anus" or "urine us".  Uranus is the ancient Greek deity of the Heavens, the earliest supreme god. Uranus was the son and mate of Gaia the father of Cronus (Saturn) and of the Cyclopes and Titans (predecessors of the Olympian gods).  Uranus, the first planet discovered in modern times, was discovered by William Herschel while systematically searching        the sky with his telescope on March 13, 1781.        It had actually been seen many times before but ignored as simply another star        (the earliest recorded sighting was in 1690 when John Flamsteed       cataloged it as 34 Tauri).        Herschel named it "the\xa0Georgium\xa0Sidus"        (the Georgian Planet) in honor of his patron,        the infamous (to Americans) King George III of England; others called it        "Herschel".  The name "Uranus" was        first proposed by Bode in conformity with the        other planetary names from classical mythology but didn\'t come into        common use until 1850.  Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 on Jan 24 1986.  Most of the planets spin on an axis nearly perpendicular to the plane of        the ecliptic but Uranus\' axis is almost        parallel to the ecliptic.        At the time of Voyager 2\'s passage,        Uranus\' south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun.        This results in the odd fact that Uranus\' polar regions receive more energy        input from the Sun than do its equatorial regions.        Uranus is nevertheless hotter at its equator than at its poles. The mechanism        underlying this is unknown.  Actually, there\'s an ongoing battle over which of Uranus\'        poles is its north pole!  Either its axial inclination is a bit over 90        degrees and its rotation is direct ,        or it\'s a bit less than 90 degrees and the rotation is retrograde .        The problem is that you need to draw a dividing line *somewhere*, because        in a case like Venus there is little dispute        that the rotation is indeed        retrograde (not a direct rotation with an inclination of nearly 180).  Uranus is composed primarily of rock and various ices ,        with only about 15% hydrogen and a little helium (in contrast to Jupiter and Saturn which are mostly hydrogen).        Uranus (and Neptune) are in many ways similar to the cores of Jupiter and        Saturn minus the massive liquid metallic hydrogen envelope.        It appears that Uranus does not have a rocky core like Jupiter and Saturn        but rather that its material is more or less uniformly distributed.  Uranus\' atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane.  Like the other gas planets, Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around  rapidly.  But they are extremely faint, visible only with radical image        enhancement of the Voyager 2 pictures        (right).        Recent observations with HST (left) show larger and        more pronounced streaks.        Further HST observations show even more activity.   Uranus is no longer the bland boring planet that Voyager saw! It now seems clear that the differences are due to        seasonal effects since the Sun is now at a  lower Uranian latitude which may        cause more pronounced day/night weather effects.   By 2007 the Sun will be directly over Uranus\'s equator.  Uranus\' blue color is the result of absorption of red light by methane in the        upper atmosphere.

It is one of the most important megalithic sites in Europe, known for the very high number of impressive prehistoric monuments found in the vicinity, and is situated on the Crach River, west of the small port of Vannes .  Introduction to Carnac  The ancient monuments feature numerous standing stones - at least 3000 are still standing - and various dolmens and menhirs and other ancient artefacts. The monuments were erected over a period of more than a thousand years, starting with neolithic man (another great prehistoric site, Stonehenge, was also constructed over a period of 1500 years, not \'all in one go\' as you might expect).  A large number of the alignments are now protected, and surrounded by fencing preventing access, which is a shame but necessary if they are to be preserved. There is also a substantial Museum of prehistory in the town.  Prehistoric terminology and ancient stone formations  No visit to Carnac would be complete without a knowledge of a few of the basics of prehistoric structure. (These terms will also help with the Visit Carnac section below).  The megalithic monuments are named from the Greek words mega (\'big\') and lithos (\'stones\'). These have different names according to type but the best known is the so-called "menhir" - a term of Breton origin, meaning stone (\'men\') and \'very high and stretched\' (\'hir\'). Normally the menhirs are not isolated but are aligned along a straight line and circle - in the second case they are called "Cromlechs", from the Breton "Crom" ( "circle") and "lech" ( "place"): so the "Cromlech" is a "place where the large stones are placed in a circle."  Besides the menhirs, another well-known monument is the \'Dolmen\'. The term means "stone table" (from the Breton \'dol\' (table) and \'men\' (stone). In practice this is a series of menhirs on top of which large stones are placed, forming a sort of room or tunnel. Another interesting aspect, next to menhirs and dolmens, is the \'tumulus’, or \'high lands\' (mounds of earth\'), found at some Cromlechs.  Visit Carnac  A tourist excursion though the monuments of Carnac should begin from the \'mound of Saint-Michel\' - a mound over 100 meters long, 35 wide and 10 metres high which protects several graves inside, where artefacts have been found dating back to 3500 BC.  Not far away you can see the famous alignment of \'Le Menech\', preceded by an oval cromlech over 100 meters in diameter and surrounded by 70 stones of one meter in height - the alignment of Le Menech heads toward the north-east, with eleven parallel lines monoliths. A Cromlech oval with a diameter of 90 meters, and close by the avenues of stone (1099 of them) are found along with a large dolmen.  An area of 240 meters divides it from the second alignment called \'Kermario\', (the "place of the dead"), which continues in the same direction with 10 parallel rows over a width of 100 meters and a length of over one kilometre, with over 1000 tall menhirs. Towards the north a giant menhir stands, known as the Giant Manius and to the south there is the Kerkado mound, which marks the beginning of the next alignment of Kerlescan, meaning the \'place of cremation\'.  This consists of more than 10 parallel rows of nearly 500 stones with different heights over a width of 140 meters followed by a semicircular cromlech approximately delimited by 40 monoliths. To the south is the so-called "Petit Menech", formed by about 100 stones. In total, there are almost 3,000 menhirs, but excavations have identified certain alignments now no longer visible, such | Question: What ancient monument and tourist attraction would you see at Carnac in northern France?', ['standing stones', 'menhirs', 'menhir'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4791'), ("Context: Actin is a family of globular multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments .

In his                                     40 years as ruler, between approximately 1010 and 970 B.C.E. ,                                     he united the people of Israel, led them to victory in battle,                                     conquered land and paved the way for his son, Solomon ,                                     to build the Holy Temple .                                     Almost all knowledge of him is derived from the books of the Prophets and Writings : Samuel                                       I and II , Kings                                         I and Chronicles I .  David was the eighth and youngest son of Jesse                                     from the kingly tribe of Judah.                                     He was also a direct descendent of Ruth the Moabite. David began his                                     life as a shepherd in Bethlehem .                                     One day, the prophet Samuel                                     called him out of the field and anointed him without the knowledge of                                     the current king, Saul .                                     David simply returned to his sheep. His first interaction with Saul                                     came when the king was looking for someone to play music for him, and                                     the king\x92s attendant summoned the skilled David to play for him.                                     Saul was pleased with David and kept him in his service as a                                     musician.  The first time David publicly displayed his                                     courage was when, as an inexperienced boy armed with only a stick and                                     a few stones, he confronted the nine-foot, bronze armored Philistine                                     giant, Goliath of Gath. After skilled warriors had cowered in fear                                     for 40 days, David made a slingshot, invoked God\x92s name, and killed                                     the giant. After this, Saul took David on as commander of his troops                                     and David formed a close friendship with Saul\x92s son, Jonathan.  David was successful in battle against the                                     Philistines and this aroused the jealousy of Saul, who tried to kill                                     David by throwing a spear at him. David stayed with Saul, however,                                     and Saul offered him his own daughter, Merav, as a wife. He later                                     reneged on his promise, but offered David his second daughter, Michal,                                     in exchange for the foreskins of 100 Philistines, a price that David                                     paid.  Saul\x92s jealousy of David grew and he asked his                                     son Jonathan to kill David. Jonathan was a friend of David\x92s,                                     however, and hid David instead. He then went to his father and                                     convinced Saul to promise not to kill David. Saul promised, and David                                     returned to his service. This promise did not last and, after Saul                                     attempted to kill David a second time, Michal helped David run away                                     to the prophet Samuel in Ramah. David returned briefly to make a pact                                     of peace with Jonathan and to verify that Saul was still planning to                                     kill him. He then continued his flight from Saul, finding refuge with                                     the king of Moab. On the way, the priest Ahimelech of Nob gave David                                     a weapon. When Saul heard this, he sent Doeg the Edomite to kill 85                                     of the city\x92s priests.  In the course of his flight, David gained the                                     support of 600 men, and he and his band traveled from city to city.                                     At one point, in Ein Gedi , David crept up on Saul while he was in a cave, but instead of killing him,                                     cut a piece from his cloak and confronted Saul. Saul broke down and                                     admitted that David would one day be king and asked David to swear                                     that he would not destroy Saul\x92s descendants or wipe out Saul\x92s                                     name. David swore to this, but it did not stop Saul from continuing                                     to pursue him. Finally, David and his supporters joined the service                                     of Achish, the Philistine king of Gath who entrusted David with                                     control of the city of Ziklag.

Get Known if you don\'t have an account  Share  Life finds a way .  "Oh yeah, \'oooh, ahhh.\' That\'s how it always starts. Then later there\'s running, and screaming."  — Dr. Ian Malcolm , in The Lost World: Jurassic Park , neatly summarizes each of the movies in the series.  Scientists discover the ability to bring extinct animals back to life via a complex cloning process. To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.  Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong .  The 1990 book Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton , while the 1993 movie Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg . Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008. But it all worked out, and the fourth film, titled Jurassic World , was released in 2015. After a highly successful run at the box office, positive reviews, and a resurrection of the franchise in general, a fifth film is to be released on June 22, 2018.

In the Sega Master System game, instead of trying to escape the island, Grant is called to fight and capture the dinosaurs. At the end of the game, he defeats the Tyrannosaurus rex and the park is allowed to open as planned.  Both human female characters in the first film are more capable than their counterparts in the book. In the book, Ellie is mostly passive and stays out of the action; in the film, she is involved just as much as the men around her and even calls out Hammond when he tries to imply he should take a dangerous mission because of her gender. Lex meanwhile was a pre-pubescent in the book and little more than The Load . The film ages her up to her teens and gives her computer skills key to getting the survivors out alive.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

He is also one of Tintin \'s closest friends. Haddock is highly addicted to whiskey but he also likes other spirits like rum. He first appeared in The Crab with the Golden Claws and had been in every Tintin \xa0book since then.\xa0  Contents  [ show ]  History  Captain Haddock sailed over twenty years with his old friend, Captain Chester , before becoming commander of the Karaboudjan where his alcoholism was taken advantage of by his crooked first mate Allan Thompson . Tintin rescued him from the ship and the two friends were barely ever parted again. He is a direct descendant of the 17th century seafarer Sir Francis Haddock , a sea captain under Charles II. He was the captain for two expeditions during his adventures with Tintin, commanding the Aurora in The Shooting Star during the expedition to find the meteorite and the Sirius , Captain Chester\'s ship that he lent to Haddock to find Red Rackham\'s treasure. At the end of the latter adventure, Haddock acquired with the proceeds of the sale of his friend Cuthbert Calculus \' patent for the Shark-proof submarine , Marlinspike Hall , which once belonged to Captain Haddock\'s ancestor Francis. Haddock retired from sailing there and invited Tintin and Calculus to indefinitely live there with him.  Name  As for the origin of the name of Captain Haddock\'s name, who first appeared in Hergé \'s notes in 1938 , according to Philippe Goddin ,\xa0author of Chronology of a work, it is inspired by Captain Craddock, Franco-German film Hanns Schwarz and Max Vaucorbeil (1931), of which Hergé was a big fan. In the original french version of The Crab with the Golden Claws, Captain Haddock even sings a song in the film: Guys navy. However, according to the first wife of Hergé, Germaine Kiekens , the name "Haddock" comes from the English fish dish, the smoked haddock. However, the name Haddock is a real surname in English, examples such as Sir Richard Haddock (1629-1715) ordered the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay. His second son, Nicholas Haddock followed the career of his father. In addition, Herbert James Haddock (1861-1946) was commander of the White Star Line and the Titanic among others in the technical tests before delivery to the transatlantic company, and then the sister ship of the Titanic, the Olympic.  Drunkness  Captain Haddock was a drunkard, Which is one of his weaknesses. He hates drinking anything that doesn´t contain alcohol, like water. He did make attampts to shake this habit, even becoming the president of the Society of Sober Sailors , a seafarers equivalent to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, when Professor Calculus invented the pills to make consumption of alcohol unpleasant in Tintin and the Picaros , this weakness was gone.  Names  Captain Haddock has a large amount of names hne isyvocabularyells many when he wishes to insult.  Bianca\'s Names  Bianca Castafiore has trouble remembering Haddock\'s last name and has created many new names, below is a list:  Addock, Capslock, Kapok, Bangkok, Bartok, Fatstock, Drydock, Hopscotch, Stopcock, Hammock, Paddock, Hassock, Havoc, Maggot, Bootblack, Balzac, Bedsock, Padlock, Hatbox, Stockpot, Harrock, and Hemlock.  One reason why Bianca Castafiore always has trouble saying Haddock\'s last name correctly may be because when they first met in the book The\xa0Calculus Affair, Haddock was unable to say his name correctly:  Castafiore:\xa0Aha, you little flatterer, so you\'ve come to congratulate me, with this... fisherman...

By Andrew Evans, National Geographic Traveler  In 7th grade I almost failed Latin.  It was the declensions that got me—also, as a 12-year old, learning a dead language was as abstract as the idea of traveling the world.  That all changed the first time I came to Europe, visited a Roman ruin, and discovered that I could read the weathered inscriptions on a 2,000 year-old stone wall. For me to comprehend a message scrawled by a disappeared civilization was simply illuminating. Latin suddenly made sense and it became my key to other languages and therefore my key to traveling the world.  Latin is still a very dead language—however, its closest living relative is doing just fine in the mountains and valleys of southeast Switzerland. In fact, you can even watch it on television.  "Welcome" in Romansh on a shop sign in Samedan, Engadin, Switzerland (Photo by AE/NGT)  \xa0  Romansh is the fourth official language of Switzerland (after Swiss German, French and Italian) and its proximity to Latin is astounding: Chesa is “house”, Chaun is “dog”, and paun is “bread”.  “It’s a Latin dialect, really,” explains Guido Ratti, a native-born Romansh speaker from the village of Samedan in the Swiss canton of Grischun. He spoke only Romansh until he was about eight years old, when he began studying his first foreign language at school: Swiss German.  “We always say—whoever knows Romansh, knows more,” says Guido, pointing out how the Romansh people of Switzerland tend to pick up other Romance languages quickly.  “Catalan is similar to Romansh and so are the dialects of Italy—so is Romanian,” he adds. “I remember in 1989 when Ceauşescu gave his final speech, I watched it on television and understood everything.  Native Romansh-speaker Niculin Bazzell speaks six different languages (Romansh, German, Italian, French, Spanish and English)—and he uses almost all of them “everyday” he says, mainly working with tourists.  “Our problem in Engadin is that we are so polite, we speak in whatever language our guest speaks,” explains Guido. People from all over the world come to Engadin for the mountains—in summer to hike and bike and in winter to ski. Guido is proud of the region’s hospitality, but feels it is crucial that they uphold Romansh in the area.  In Engadin, the first three years of school are taught entirely in Romansh, after which instruction gradually switches over to Swiss German. There is a full-time Romansh radio station and Romansh language television plays on Swiss TV, every night from 6:00 to 7:00 pm. (It’s like watching the news in Latin.)  According to Guido, there are “about 100,000 people who still speak [Romansh],” though the Swiss census counts only 60,000 speakers. In any case, Romansh is a minority language, spoken by less than 1% of the population. This group is broken down into four main dialects which together form a kind of linguistic tidal pool “leftover from the Roman soldiers who used to live in Engadin.”  Unlike Swiss German, Romansh is, in fact, a written language—a fact that plays a role in its survival. The Bible was first printed in Romansh in 1530, at the time of the reformation. And yet, oddly, Romansh was not made an official language of Switzerland until 1938, when the country voted by referendum to include it along with German, French and Italian.  “My language will survive!” proclaims Guido. Not only for its government protection but, “because so many people are conserving it.” Today, there is even a Romansh Wikipedia , however the long-term survival depends on parents passing it onto their children.  “I am completely Romansh and my sons speak Romansh but they both married girls from Zurich, so | Question: Romansh is a native and official language of which country?', ['switzerland'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6751'), ("Context: Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh .

'' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character .

Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C.

The first time she became wedded to Prince Philip; the second time at her coronation, she became wedded to the people. Each occasion demanded a dress of majestic beauty and on each occasion she chose dress designer, Norman Hartnell.\xa0  With his theatrical training, Hartnell was the ideal person to make spectacular dresses which would hold a stage of another kind.  Hartnell's Research  Less than three months before the wedding date, one of Hartnell's designs was approved and he began his research immediately. He describes this in his autobiography (1955): 'I roamed the London Art Galleries in search of classic inspiration and fortunately found a Botticelli figure in clinging ivory silk, trailed with jasmine, smilax, syringa and small white rose-like blossoms. I thought these flora might be interpreted on a modern dress through the medium of white crystals and pearls.'  Because of Wartime restrictions, the pearls were not available in this country, and eventually Hartnell obtained twenty thousand of the correct pearls from America. Once the pearls were in his possession Hartnell set about transferring the embroidery design to the paper pattern, but before the embroideresses could carry out the work Hartnell found himself in the throes of a publicity scandal.\xa0\xa0 You are reading an original 'Queen's Wedding  Dress' royalty fashion history article by Pauline Weston Thomas at www.fashion-era.com \xa0©  Politically Correct Silkworms  ...(v4r)  The Queen Mother had specifically asked that Hartnell should use an unusually rich, lustrous stiff satin which was made at Lullington Castle. The satin was ideal for the train, but Hartnell thought that the dress required a more supple material of a similar tone. He ordered the similar fabric from the Scottish firm of Winterthur near Dunfermline. Difficulties arose when rivals put about the rumour that the Scottish satin was made from 'enemy silk worms', either from Italy or possibly Japan. A telephone call to Dunfermline settled the scandal. Mr. Hartnell was assured the silkworms were from Nationalist China and were not 'enemy silkworms'.\xa0  However politically correct the silkworms were, time has shown that the choice of silk was not a good one and below you can read some facts about the dress in my interview with Miss Kay Staniland, Keeper of the  Robes in the London Museum in 1978.  But thirty years before in 1947 there was no immediate thought in Hartnell's mind that this would be a Museum piece of the future. His concern was to complete the gown as quickly and in as much secrecy as possible. Despite the many attempts of the press to bribe Hartnell's staff, the only glimpse newspapermen had of the dress, was when the covered four foot box containing the dress, left Hartnell's salon the day before the wedding.\xa0  The Hartnell Wedding     Dress and Pictures  The following day the Princess walked down the aisle of Westminster Abbey on the arm of His Majesty King George VI.\xa0Right  - Now we are married...

Having developed an interest in acting , he left the Highland Light Infantry, travelled to Hollywood , and had several minor roles in film. He first appeared as an extra in the British film There Goes the Bride (1932). From there, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films from 1933 to 1935, including a non-speaking part in MGM ‘s Mutiny on the Bounty . This brought him to wider attention within the film industry and he was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn . Upon the outbreak of the Second World War , Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being recommissioned as a lieutenant .  Niven resumed his acting career after his demobilisation , and was voted the second-most popular British actor in the 1945 Popularity Poll of British film stars. He appeared in A Matter of Life and Death (1946), The Bishop’s Wife (1947), and Enchantment (1948), all of which received critical acclaim. Niven later appeared in The Elusive Pimpernel (1950), The Toast of New Orleans (1950), Happy Go Lovely (1951), Happy Ever After (1954) and Carrington V.C. (1955) before scoring a big success as Phileas Fogg in Michael Todd ‘s production of Around the World in 80 Days (1956). Niven appeared in nearly a hundred films, and many shows for television. He also began writing books, with considerable commercial success. In 1982 he appeared in Blake Edwards ‘ final “Pink Panther” films Trail of the Pink Panther and Curse of the Pink Panther , reprising his role as Sir Charles Lytton.

Niven often claimed that he was born in Kirriemuir , in the Scottish county of Angus in 1909, but his birth certificate shows this was not the case. [4]  Henrietta was of French and British ancestry. She was born in Wales , the daughter of army officer William Degacher (1841–1879) by his marriage to Julia Caroline Smith, the daughter of Lieutenant General James Webber Smith. Niven’s grandfather William Degacher was killed in the Battle of Isandlwana (1879), during the Zulu War .

As you are probably fully aware, the former indefinitely suspended quarterback had his suspension cut to the first two games of the 2009 NFL season by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for his actions related to his much publicized dogfighting case that cost him almost two years in a Leavenworth, Kansas prison.\xa0 \xa0  The July 2009 signing of the controversial quarterback by the Philadelphia Eagles, long known as a “High Character” team for years, was a total shock to Philly fans and media.\xa0 The signing fueled a firestorm of talk radio, chat room, and water cooler discussions everywhere, with the question of “Why bring in a distraction of this magnitude?”\xa0  However, after an initial fire storm of publicity about the signing—people saying they would turn in their season tickets, picketing threats, etc—Vick’s presence on the Eagles\' roster seemed to have been  minimized.\xa0 The former highest paid player in the NFL “quietly” went about his business of re-acclimating into the NFL as the Birds\' third or fourth quarterback.\xa0 Plus, doing some much needed PR work related to curbing dog fighting in urban communities.  There is no doubt that the Eagles went out on a limb to sign the infamous quarterback earlier this summer not as social commentary, but as an insurance policy.\xa0 And like it usually does, fate stepped in and any chances of the Eagles continuing to bring Vick along slowly were thrown out the door in Week one of the regular season.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0  Eagles\' starting quarterback Donovan McNabb was injured (broken rib) in a win over the Panthers . As McNabb laid on the ground, several eyes looked to Philadelphia Eagles Owner Jeff Lurie’s suite at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, NC.\xa0  You could almost hear, “Paging Michael Vick…Paging Michael Vick” through the television even though the former three-time Pro Bowl player was not eligible until Week three (KC Chiefs).\xa0  Well, week three of the NFL regular season is here, and Eagles head coach Andy Reid will probably be redeeming the Eagles’ Vick insurance policy as the team looks for a win before their bye week (week four).\xa0  McNabb’s rib injury has lingered, and Eagles fill-in starter Kevin Kolb played up and down in a lopsided loss to the New Orleans Saints in week two, so Vick better be ready for the heat of the NFL regular season.\xa0 If game preparations go as expected, look for Kolb to start, Vick to be the backup, and newly signed backup Jeff Garcia to be the “emergency” quarterback.\xa0  Vick—career passing numbers of 930-1730, 54 percent, 11505 yards, 71 TDs, 52 INTs | Question: What team does controversial quarterback Michael Vick play for in the National Football League in the USA?', ['philadelphia eagles'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3213'), ("Context: `` Stop and identify '' statutes are statutory laws in the United States that authorize police to legally obtain the identification of someone whom they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime .

The History Learning Site , 5 Mar 2015. 20 Oct 2016.  Medieval England experienced few revolts but the most serious was the Peasants’ Revolt which took place in June 1381. A violent system of punishments for offenders was usually enough to put off peasants from causing trouble. Most areas in England also had castles in which soldiers were garrisoned, and these were usually enough to guarantee reasonable behaviour among medieval peasants.  An army of peasants from Kent and Essex marched on London. They did something no-one had done before or since – they captured the Tower of London. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the King’s Treasurer were killed. The king, Richard II, was only 14 at the time but despite his youth, he agreed to meet the peasants at a place called Mile End.  What were the peasants angry about and why had they come to London ?  1. After the Black Death , many manors were left short of workers. To encourage those who had survived to stay on their manor, many lords had given the peasants on their estates their freedom and paid them to work on their land. Now, nearly 35 years after the Black Death, many peasants feared that the lords would take back these privileges and they were prepared to fight for them.  2. Many peasants had to work for free on church land, sometimes up to two days in the week. This meant that they could not work on their own land which made it difficult to grow enough food for their families. Peasants wanted to be free of this burden that made the church rich but them poor. They were supported in what they wanted by a priest called John Ball from Kent.  3. There had been a long war with France. Wars cost money and that money usually came from the peasants through the taxes that they paid. In 1380, Richard II introduced a new tax called the Poll Tax. This made everyone who was on the tax register pay 5p. It was the third time in four years that such a tax had been used. By 1381, the peasants had had enough. 5p to them was a great deal of money. If they could not pay in cash, they could pay in kind, such as seeds, tools etc., anything that could be vital to survival in the coming year.  In May 1381, a tax collector arrived at the Essex village of Fobbing to find out why the people there had not paid their poll tax. He was thrown out by the villagers. In June, soldiers arrived to establish law and order. They too were thrown out as the villagers of Fobbing had now organised themselves and many other local villages in Essex had joined them. After doing this, the villagers marched on London to plead with the young king to hear their complaints.  One man had emerged as the leader of the peasants – Wat Tyler from Kent. As the peasants from Kent had marched to London, they had destroyed tax records and tax registers. The buildings which housed government records were burned down. They got into the city of London because the people there had opened the gates to them.  By mid-June the discipline of the peasants was starting to go. Many got drunk in London and looting took place. It is known that foreigners were murdered by the peasants. Wat Tyler had asked for discipline amongst those who looked up to him as their leader. He did not get it.  On June 14th, the king met the rebels at Mile End. At this meeting, Richard II gave the peasants all that they asked for and asked that they go home in peace. Some did. Others returned to the city and murdered the archbishop and Treasurer – their heads were cut off on Tower Hill by the Tower of London. Richard II spent the night in hiding in fear of his life.  On June 15th, he met the rebels again at Smithfield outside of the city’s walls. It is said that this was the idea of the Lord Mayor (Sir William | Question: Who was the leader of the Peasant's Revolt in 1381 who, after killing a poll tax collector, marched on London with supporters and was killed there at Smithfield by the Lord Mayor of London?", ['wat tyler'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2980'), ('Context: P.G.

The squad featured top players like [Hulk], [Marcelo] and [Neymar] along with a host of talents, several of which had played when Brazil won the 2011 U-20 World Cup. Their chief opponents were expected to be Spain. They had won the European qualifier, their senior team had just won Euro 2012, and a few of those players also competed at the Olympics: [Javi Martínez], [Juan Mata] and [Jordi Alba]. Other contenders were the unknown British team – composed of English and Welsh players, featuring veteran star [Ryan Giggs] – and Mexico, which had placed third at the 2011 U-20 Worlds (runner-up Portugal didn't qualify). Four teams débuted at the Olympics: Belarus, Gabon, Senegal and United Arab Emirates.  The biggest surprise of the preliminaries was the elimination of Spain, which lost twice and drew once. The other favorites did proceed to the quarter-finals, where the hosts lost to South Korea on penalties. Brazil won 3-2 over tiny Honduras after being 1-2 down, while Mexico needed extra time against Senegal. The fourth semi-finalist was Japan, which ousted Egypt.  Both Japan and Mexico had only once before reached the semi-final stage of an Olympic football tournament, both in 1968, when the Japanese beat Mexico for the bronze. This time, the Central Americans proceeded despite an early lead through Japan's [Yuki Otsu]. South Korea, first-time Olympic semi-finalist, was too weak for the Brazilians, who proceeded into their third Olympic final.  Brazil was heavily favored for the gold, but the Mexicans delivered a sensitive blow only 28 seconds into the game, when [Oribe Peralta] struck after a defensive error. The Brazilians dominated most of the match, but were unable to seriously threaten the Mexican defense.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.  The phrase is now used internationally and it’s not surprising it has become the third most known slogan of all time.  \xa0  \xa0  [1] The phrase is a registered trademark of Ronseal’s owner, the Sherwin-Williams Company , across the European Community for products including paints, varnishes and wood preservatives (E3085826)  [3] Source Creative Review February 2012  \xa0  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tinThe Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin - BBC News  BBC News  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin  8 January 2013  Read more about sharing.

In 2004, he said: "People are crying out for a kind of Ronseal politics - they want it to do what it says on the tin."  People use the phrase every day. On YouTube you can listen to Katie Melua\'s What It Says On The Tin . Google the line and you get millions of results.

The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem , but not if the flag was not present . On December 23 , 1942 , the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegiance versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart .

In 2006 Tatiana Kuplich organized the trees of the Amazon into four categories: (1) mature forest, (2) regenerating forest [less than three years], (3) regenerating forest [between three and five years of regrowth], and (4) regenerating forest [eleven to eighteen years of continued development].

We caught a few glimpses of the result early in Kill Bill Vol. 1 with the wreckage left behind when Bill and the Vipers assaulted a tiny rural chapel and slaughtered everyone in sight. Vol. 2 gives us, for the first time, a full account of the wedding rehearsal massacre that sets the plot of this two-part epic in motion. After fending off attacks from Bill’s trailer-trash kid brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and her chief rival within the Squad, Daryl Hannah’s Elle Driver, The Bride tracks her ultimate quarry to his lair in Mexico.  It might be a slight exaggeration to describe Kill Bill Vol. 2 as a “relationship movie.” But it may look like one, at times, in comparison with the wall-to-wall Asian swordplay action of Vol. 1 . Both films are still, as Carradine says, “kung-fu samurai Spaghetti Western love stories.” But as the actor noted in a recent published interview: “ The second one has got a lot more of what you’re used to from Quentin; the quirky character stuff, the surprises, the funny stuff.”  In Kill Bill Vol. 1 , actor David Carradine was almost entirely a sinister presence behind the scenes, a familiar, seductive, baritone voice murmuring on the soundtrack\xad—despite the fact that he played the movie’s title role. But along with Uma Thurman, who continues to cut a wide swath as the revenge-driven Bride, “David dominates Vol. 2 ,” according to writer-director Quentin Tarantino.  When I tell people the name of the movie is Kill Bill ,” Carradine says, “and that I’m Bill, they ask me: ‘Well, what are you, the bad guy?’ And I have to tell ’em, ‘There are no good guys in a Quentin Tarantino movie. It’s all about the bad guys.’ The essence of a Tarantino movie is an inside look at the minds and hearts of violent people. That’s what we go to see his movies for. It’s climbing inside these people’s psyches and showing what makes them tick. There’s a nobility about Bill, yet you also know he’s one of the most evil people you’ve ever met in your life. “Bill is more fun than anything,” Carradine recently told The Associated Press. “Bill has virtually no human problems. He’s just kind of put himself above it all.”  In Vol. 1 we learned that Bill, a broker of killers for hire, had assembled and trained a ruthless assortment of assassins, the so-called Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS). Each of these gifted murderers was code-named for a different species of poisonous snake: O’Ren-Ishii (Lucy Liu) was Cottonmouth, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) was California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) was Copperhead, and Budd (Michael Madsen), Bill’s kid brother and the only other male in the Viper Squad, was known as Sidewinder.  The lethal weapon known as Black Mamba, played by Thurman, the most talented of them all, was also Bill’s lover, and she became a fugitive from the assassination game when she learned that she was pregnant with his child. At that moment her worldview shifted on its axis. She no longer wanted to kill or to put her life in mortal danger. She changed her name, hid out in a small town, and found herself a kind and stable man to a marry.  But Bill was not about to let this situation stand. We caught a few glimpses of the result early in Kill Bill Vol. 1 with the wreckage left behind when Bill and the Vipers assaulted a tiny rural chapel and slaughtered everyone in sight.

After the victory over Austria in 1866 , Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests , while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans .

In  another carriage just behind, followed Garfield\'s two oldest sons, while Lucretia in poor health and still recovering, was resting in a New  Jersey resort and preparing for travel.  Garfield and Secretary Blaine  arrived at the train station and were making their way through the  crowds as Guiteau approached them from behind. Guiteau raised his  gun, aimed, fired and the first shot grazed and stunned the President. He then fired  a second shot that struck the President forcefully and lodged deep into his  back. Garfield slumped to the tile floor, looking on as Guiteau was pounced upon, quickly subdued and arrested. Guiteau requested to be taken to jail at once and he was obliged.  Guiteau  Left a letter to be found the morning of the shooting addressed to  General William Tecumseh Sherman: July 2, 1881. It Read...  "I  have just shot the President.

Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries—even death.  Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is unexpectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite  Heathcliff’s clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine’s ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.  When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.  Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley’s cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father’s death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.  When he returns, he has mysteriously acquired wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to a baby girl, Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.  Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine’s post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.  Analysis  Despite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly’s narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!  Nelly’s judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.  It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.  All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.
