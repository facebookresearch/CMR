She is an only child . Evie attends a school for gifted children ( run by her mother ) and achieves good grades there . Her mother had always told Evie that her father was a secret agent , but on her thirteenth birthday Evie began to develop superhuman abilities and it was revealed that her father is an extraterrestrial from the planet Antareus . Evie 's main power is the ability to freeze time on Earth by touching the tips of her index fingers together , allowing her to maneuver herself or objects to alter the course of events on Earth . When she claps her hands together , time resumes as normal . She can also `` unfreeze '' individuals by touching them while time is frozen . She later gains the power to gleep , which allows her to manifest objects by using the power of her mind . Her father describes her as `` the perfect child : loving ; caring ; with the same needs of most teenagers '' . The series follows Evie through her teenage years , from her thirteenth birthday in the first episode to her eighteenth birthday in the final episode . Although she was the leading character , Flannigan was billed last in the credits . In the first season , she received the billing `` And Introducing Maureen Flannigan '' . In the last 3 seasons , she was billed as `` And Maureen Flannigan as Evie '' .   Donna Garland ( Donna Pescow ) -- Evie 's mother .

Troy is a human - looking extraterrestrial , with many special powers , from the planet Antareus . Troy met Donna when his spacecraft crashed on Earth at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s . The two fell in love , were married in 1971 , and two years later Donna gave birth to Evie . Shortly after , in 1974 , Troy was called back to Antareus to fight in a war . Since then , Troy occasionally visits Earth , and stays in touch with his daughter via a special communication device known as the `` cube '' ( see below ) . Troy 's powers seem to be almost limitless : though he lives on Antareus , he can control many things on Earth ( from computers to the weather ) ; he can give and take away Evie 's powers at will ; and also seems to be aware of certain events on Earth . While Troy appears in the show 's opening credits , he rarely makes a physical appearance in the series -- and when he does his face is obscured ( for example , via a surgical mask or shadows ) . In the series finale , when Troy arrives on Earth , he is seen in a silhouette with stars from the galaxy . Troy was credited as `` himself '' in the opening credits from Season Two onwards .   Beano Froelich ( 1987 -- 1990 ) ( Joe Alaskey ) -- `` Uncle Beano '' is Donna 's brother and Evie 's uncle , who lives next door to them .

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

"And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

Now, the 1984 romantic comedy is getting a remake – this time with a twist.  Producer Brain Grazer admitted during an interview with CNBC that a remake of “Splash”; was in the works. While Grazer kept mostly mum on the details, he revealed that this version of the story would be told from the mermaid’s perspective.

Movie Review - - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE ...Movie Review -    - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE - NYTimes.com  SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE  By JANET MASLIN  Published: March     9, 1984  THOUGH Ron Howard's comedies don't adhere to any familiar formulas - Mr. Howard's funny ''Night Shift'' was about a prostitution ring operating out of a morgue, and his even more disarming new ''Splash'' is about a mermaid in Manhattan - they have a comfortably old-fashioned flavor. ''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ("Context: Writers and directors have featured a black man as president in several memorable portrayals .

In the Neolithic evidence of early pottery appeared , as did sculpture and the construction of megaliths . Early rock art also first appeared during this period . The advent of metalworking in the Bronze Age brought additional media available for use in making art , an increase in stylistic diversity , and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art . It also saw the development in some areas of artisans , a class of people specializing in the production of art , as well as early writing systems . By the Iron Age , civilizations with writing had arisen from Ancient Egypt to Ancient China . | Question: paleolithic art including cave art and portable art began during what period ?', ['Upper Palaeolithic'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-29731'), ("Context: George Herman `` Babe '' Ruth Jr . ( February 6 , 1895 -- August 16 , 1948 ) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) spanned 22 seasons , from 1914 through 1935 . Nicknamed `` The Bambino '' and `` The Sultan of Swat '' , he began his MLB career as a stellar left - handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox , but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees . Ruth established many MLB batting ( and some pitching ) records , including career home runs ( 714 ) , runs batted in ( RBIs ) ( 2,213 ) , bases on balls ( 2,062 ) , slugging percentage (. 690 ) , and on - base plus slugging ( OPS ) ( 1.164 ) ; the latter two still stand as of 2018 .

The thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front , although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres ( 4 in ) to 250 millimetres ( 10 in ) . For example , Biskra , Algeria and Ouarzazate , Morocco are found in this zone . The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres ( 4 in ) to 250 millimetres ( 10 in ) . For example , Timbuktu , Mali and Agadez , Niger are found in this zone . The vast central hyper - arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime , and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 millimetre ( 0.04 in ) . In fact , most of the Sahara receives less than 20 millimetres ( 0.8 in ) . Of the 9,000,000 square kilometres ( 3,500,000 sq mi ) of desert land in the Sahara , an area of about 2,800,000 square kilometres ( 1,100,000 sq mi ) ( about 31 % of the total area ) receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 millimetres ( 0.4 in ) or less , while some 1,500,000 square kilometres ( 580,000 sq mi ) ( about 17 % of the total area ) receives an average of 5 millimetres ( 0.2 in ) or less . The annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1,000,000 square kilometres ( 390,000 sq mi ) in the eastern Sahara comprising deserts of : Libya , Egypt and Sudan ( Tazirbu , Kufra , Dakhla , Kharga , Farafra , Siwa , Asyut , Sohag , Luxor , Aswan , Abu Simbel , Wadi Halfa ) where the long - term mean approximates 0.5 millimetres ( 0.02 in ) per year . Rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the Sahara as it may vary considerably year by year . In full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts , the annual rates of potential evaporation are extraordinarily high , roughly ranging from 2,500 millimetres ( 100 in ) per year to more than 6,000 millimetres ( 240 in ) per year in the whole desert .

Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century , beginning with Jesus 's Ascension to Heaven . The early chapters , set in Jerusalem , describe the Day of Pentecost ( the coming of the Holy Spirit ) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem . Initially , the Jews are receptive to the Christian message , but soon they turn against the followers of Jesus . Rejected by the Jews , under the guidance of the Apostle Peter the message is taken to the Gentiles .

The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley , California , when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska . He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment , where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs .

The two meiotic divisions are known as Meiosis I and Meiosis II . Before meiosis begins , during S phase of the cell cycle , the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids , which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion . This S - phase can be referred to as `` premeiotic S - phase '' or `` meiotic S - phase '' . Immediately following DNA replication , meiotic cells enter a prolonged G2 - like stage known as meiotic prophase . During this time , homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo genetic recombination , a programmed process in which DNA is cut and then repaired , which allows them to exchange some of their genetic information . A subset of recombination events results in crossovers , which create physical links known as chiasmata ( singular : chiasma , for the Greek letter Chi ( X ) ) between the homologous chromosomes . In most organisms , these links are essential to direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to segregate away from each other during Meiosis I , resulting in two haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell . During Meiosis II , the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another , as during mitosis . In some cases all four of the meiotic products form gametes such as sperm , spores , or pollen .

Boston Latin School was founded in 1635 and is both the first public school and oldest existing school in the United States . The first free taxpayer - supported public school in North America , the Mather School , was opened in Dorchester , Massachusetts , in 1639 . Cremin ( 1970 ) stresses that colonists tried at first to educate by the traditional English methods of family , church , community , and apprenticeship , with schools later becoming the key agent in `` socialization . '' At first , the rudiments of literacy and arithmetic were taught inside the family , assuming the parents had those skills . Literacy rates were much higher in New England because much of the population had been deeply involved in the Protestant Reformation and learned to read in order to read the Scriptures . Literacy was much lower in the South , where the Anglican Church was the established church . Single working - class people formed a large part of the population in the early years , arriving as indentured servants .

Formula One cars of the 1990s made the most high - profile debut of this technology in motor sports , and enhanced variations on this theme are still in use in many forms of road racing and drag racing today . The simple push - pull action of the shift mechanism also lends itself to semi-automatic control using either hydraulic or pneumatic actuators -- a system often referred to as paddle - shift . Instead of a manual gear lever , the driver is provided with ( usually ) a pair of flipper paddles on the steering wheel , rally cars often utilize just a double - acting single paddle . Pulling on the right - hand paddle makes an up - shift and pulling on the left - hand paddle makes a down - shift . The paddle - shift system will use a sophisticated electronic control unit to provide the necessary logic to operate the shift mechanism . This type of paddle - shift system fitted to race and rally cars should not be confused with most of the current crop of paddle - shift systems fitted to some high - end road cars .

DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells .

Frau is in origin the equivalent of `` Mylady '' or `` Madam '' , a form of address of a noblewoman . But by an ongoing process of devaluation of honorifics , it came to be used as the unmarked term for `` woman '' by about 1800 . Therefore , Fräulein came to be interpreted as expressing a `` diminutive of woman '' , as it were implying that a Fräulein is not - quite - a-woman . By the 1960s , this came to be seen as patronising by proponents of feminism , and during the 1970s and 1980s , the term Fräulein became nearly taboo in urban and official settings , while it remained an unmarked standard in many rural areas . This process was somewhat problematic , at least during the 1970s to 1980s , since many unmarried women of the older generation insisted on Fräulein as a term of distinction , respecting their status , and took the address of Frau as offensive or suggestive of extra-marital sexual experience . | Question: how do you say young lady in german ?", ['Fräulein'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-52694'), ("Context: `` It Was n't Me '' is the first single from Jamaican - American reggae artist Shaggy 's multi-Platinum studio album Hot Shot ( 2000 ) .

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.  Queen Anne's Signature  Quotes:  �She meant well and was not a fool; but nobody can maintain that she was wise, nor entertaining in conversation� � Sarah Churchill (about Queen Anne)  �Queen Anne was the quintessence of ordinariness; she also had more than her fair share of small-mindedness, vulgarity and downright meanness� � Historian J.P. Kenyon  �Cricket is not illegal, for it is a manly game� - Queen Anne.  �Brandy Nan� � nickname for Queen Anne (who was reputedly fond of drink).

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.  Things to Do and See in Coney Island  The Coney Island Museum  For less than a dollar, visitors can get to see artifacts that bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear Coney Island in this quaint museum. Located on the second floor of an historic building on Surf Avenue with a delightful view of classic amusement park rides, the Coney Island museum interprets and preserves the history of the area through a small but fascinating collection of items.

The museum is open every Saturday and Sunday between 12 and 5 pm, right through the year, with opening hours sometimes extended during the summer months. The museum also serves as a tourist information center where visitors can use the bathrooms and receive knowledgeable answers to the questions about the area.

The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002, before being revived by the same channel in 2006 under the title of All Star Family Fortunes . The game involves two families providing answers to \'everyday questions\' that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show (e.g. \'Name something usually done in the dark\') to win cash prizes (and sometimes mystery prizes for giving a correct answer). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, originally known as "Mr. Babbage", which famously sounds a wrong answer "Eh-uhh" sound effect and its accompanying X to signal the strike, as well as a "ding" for a right answer).  Contents  11 External links  Hosts and presentation[ edit ]  Family Fortunes was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980–83) then by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983–85). After being rested for the whole of 1986, the show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter, and had a consistently successful run for the next 15 years. It was then moved out of peak time and became a daily daytime show, hosted by Andy Collins , but it only had a short run in this format before being axed.  In 2006, the series was revived with Vernon Kay as host, and was renamed All Star Family Fortunes , as each team consisted of a celebrity and four family members. The show was also transmitted back to peak time. Prize money goes to a charity of the celebrity\'s choice, and contestants being either celebrity families, or a group of actors famous for playing a fictional family. Several Christmas specials of All Star Family Fortunes have aired as well.  The most iconic aspects of the show are the large computer screen, named "Mr Babbage" by original host Bob Monkhouse and the famous computerised "Eh-uhh" sound used when wrong answers are given. Both were originally designed to appear high-tech but have since become fondly regarded for being quite the opposite (as compared to the original US Feud, which has used a video board since its 1999 revival). The computer screen name "Mr Babbage" was in recognition to the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer, Charles Babbage .  Format[ edit ]  Two family teams, each with five members, are asked to guess the results of surveys, in which 100 people would be asked open ended questions (e.g. "we asked 100 people to name something associated with the country Wales" or "we asked 100 people to name a breed of dog"). Although rarely acknowledged in the show, the 100 people surveyed are invariably audience members who have volunteered before the show.  Each round begins with a member of each family (in rotation, meaning all players do this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question is read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the most popular answer, the other nominee is asked. The family with the more popular answer then chooses whether to "play" the question, or "pass" control to the other family.  The host then passes down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each. After each answer, the board reveals whether this answer featured. If not, the family is assessed a strike, and the family loses control of the board after accumulating three strikes (also referred as striking out) in the round. If a family manages to come up with all the survey answers (most commonly six in the early part of the show, reduced in number after the commercial break) before striking out, they win the amount in pounds of the total | Question: Who presented Family Fortunes in the two years between Bob Monkhouse and Les Dennis?', ['max bygraves'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-287'), ("Context: Jodie Comer as Kate Parks , a 23 - year - old University graduate who has been secretly having a two - year affair with Simon Foster . | Question: who is doctor foster 's husband having an affair with ?", ['Kate Parks'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-31896'), ("Context: Chyler Leigh West ( pronounced / ˈkaɪlər / KY - lər ; born Potts ; April 10 , 1982 ) , known professionally as Chyler Leigh , is an American actress , singer and model .

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. | Question: The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?', ['distinction'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10042'), ('Context: The Parliament of India is the supreme legislative body of the Republic of India .

LAKE DISTRICT, in England, a district containing all the principal English lakes, and variously termed the Lake Country, Lakeland and " the Lakes." It falls within the north-western counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire (Furness district), about one-half being within the first of these. Although celebrated far outside the confines of Great Britain as a district of remarkable and strongly individual physical beauty, its area is only some 700 sq. m., a circle with radius of 15 M. from the central point covering practically the whole. Within this circle, besides the largest lake, Windermere, is the highest point in England, Scafell Pike; yet Windermere is but roe m. in length, and covers an area of 5.69 sq. m., while Scafell Pike is only 3210 ft. in height. But the lakes show a wonderful variety of character, from open expanse and steep rock-bound shores to picturesque island-groups and soft wooded banks; while the mountains have always a remarkable dignity, less from the profile of their summits than from the bold sweeping lines of their flanks, unbroken by vegetation, and often culminating in sheer cliffs or crags. At their feet, the flat green valley floors of the higher elevations give place in the lower parts to lovely woods. The streams are swift and clear, and numerous small waterfalls are characteristic of the district. To the north, west and south, a flat coastal belt, bordering the Irish Sea, with its inlets Morecambe Bay and Solway Firth, and broadest in the north, marks off the Lake District, while to the east the valleys of the Eden and the Lune divide it from the Pennine mountain system. Geologically, too, it is individual. Its centre is of volcanic rocks, complex in character, while the Coal-measures and New Red Sandstone appear round the edges. The district as a whole is grooved by a main depression, running from north to south along the valleys of St John, Thirlmere, Grasmere\' and Windermere, . surmounting a pass (Dunmail Raise) of only 783 ft.; while a secondary depression, in the same direction, runs along Derwentwater, Borrowdale, Wasdale and Wastwater, but here Sty Head Pass, between Borrowdale and Wasdale, rises to 1600 ft. The centre of the 15-m. radius lies on the lesser heights between Langstrath and Dunmail Raise, which may, however, be the crown of an ancient dome of rocks, " the dissected skeleton of which, worn by the warfare of air and rain and ice, now alone remains " (Dr H. R.. Mill, " Bathymetrical Survey of the English Lakes," Geographical Journal, vi. 48). The principal features of the district may be indicated by following this circle round from north, by west, south and east. The river. Derwent (q.v.), rising in the tarns and " gills " or ghylls " (small streams running in deeply-grooved clefts) north of Sty Head Pass and the Scafell mass flows north through the wooded Borrowdale and forms Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite. These two lakes are in a class apart from all the rest, being broader for their length, and quite shallow (about 18 ft. average and 70 ft. maximum), as distinct from the long, narrow and deep troughs occupied by the other chief lakes, which average from 40 to 135 ft. deep. Derwentwater (q.v.), studded with many islands, is perhaps the most beautiful of all. Borrowdale is joined on the east by the bare wild dale of Langstrath, and the Greta joins the Derwent immediately below Derwentwater; the town of Keswick lying near the junction. Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite occupy a single depression, a flat alluvial plain separating them. From Seatoller In Borrowdale a road traverses Honister Pass (I loo ft.), whence it descends westward, beneath the majestic Honister Crags, where green slate is quarried, into the valley containing Buttermere (94 ft. max. depth) and Crummock Water (144 ft.) | Question: Which lake in the Lake District is separated from Crummock Water by a narrow alluvial flat?', ['buttermere'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4966'), ("Context: `` I Do n't Wanna Live Without Your Love '' is a hit song written by Diane Warren and Albert Hammond for the group Chicago and recorded for their album Chicago 19 ( 1988 ) , with Bill Champlin singing lead vocals .

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen.

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology. Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) . What Arnott called proof through the “hard school of practical production” suggests an axiom that doing it by-hand is a kind of Occam’s razor for purifying and endorsing historical conjecture as common- | Question: To prove his theories of the diaspora of South American peoples, who sailed in a balsa raft called Kon Tiki across the Pacific Ocean in 1947?', ['ra ii', 'thor heyerdahl'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3515'), ("Context: The Stolen Generations ( also known as Stolen Children ) were the children of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent who were removed from their families by the Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions , under acts of their respective parliaments .

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.  In June 1992, the High Court of Australia overturned the previous concept of terra nullius which stated that, in legal terms, Australia was empty of inhabitants when it was first settled by Europeans | Question: What is Australia's largest island?", ['tasmania'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3945'), ("Context: In the United States , the disease was first observed in Haskell County , Kansas , in January 1918 , prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the U.S. Public Health Service 's academic journal .

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

Information on this page is likely to be appropriate                            for first-level courses such as AS and A-Level Human                            Biology, ITEC Anatomy and Physiology, and other courses                            in Health Sciences.  The location(s) of the Adrenal Glands:  The human body normally* includes two adrenal glands.  They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.  There are also some Ganglion cells                            are also observed. Blood from throughout                           the adrenal gland collects into large medullary veins to exit                           the gland.

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ("Context: `` Stop and identify '' statutes are statutory laws in the United States that authorize police to legally obtain the identification of someone whom they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime .

In the case of Utah v.

Wife:  sister  About Friedrich Engels  Friedrich Engels (German pronunciation: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈɛŋəls]; 28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German industrialist, social scientist, author, political theorist, philosopher, and father of Marxist theory, alongside Karl Marx. In 1845 he published The Condition of the Working Class in England, based on personal observations and research. In 1848 he co-authored The Communist Manifesto with Karl Marx, and later he supported Marx financially to do research and write Das Kapital. After Marx\'s death Engels edited the second and third volumes. Additionally, Engels organized Marx\'s notes on the "Theories of Surplus Value" and this was later published as the "fourth volume" of Capital.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.  The phrase is now used internationally and it’s not surprising it has become the third most known slogan of all time.  \xa0  \xa0  [1] The phrase is a registered trademark of Ronseal’s owner, the Sherwin-Williams Company , across the European Community for products including paints, varnishes and wood preservatives (E3085826)  [3] Source Creative Review February 2012  \xa0  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tinThe Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin - BBC News  BBC News  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin  8 January 2013  Read more about sharing.  Close share panel  Prime Minister David Cameron used a famous advertising slogan to sum up the state of the coalition government at its halfway point, saying "it is a Ronseal deal - it does what it says on the tin". This phrase has entered the British vernacular, says its co-creator Dave Shelton.  David Cameron has said it before. In 2004, he said: "People are crying out for a kind of Ronseal politics - they want it to do what it says on the tin."  People use the phrase every day. On YouTube you can listen to Katie Melua\'s What It Says On The Tin . Google the line and you get millions of results.  In 1994, when my advertising partner Liz Whiston and I came up with the line "Does exactly what it says on the tin" for Ronseal, we never dreamed how it would enter the language.  About the author  Dave Shelton and Liz Whiston co-founded Bordello Advertising.  They have been working in advertising for more than 20 years.  Back then Ronseal was just another varnish fighting for market share against a lot of fancier lifestyle brands. Anyone wandering into a DIY superstore was faced with a wall of different solutions to whatever woodcare job they might be trying to tackle.  We had presented a number of different campaigns, all of which had been rejected by Ged Shields, the then marketing director of Ronseal for "trying too hard".

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  Special relationships exist between the measures of consecutive angles, opposite angles and opposite sides of a parallelogram. A square is the most straightforward parallelogram, because it has 2 sets of parallel sides. Naturally, all of its angles and sides match in length or measure.  Facts About a Parallelogram  (1) The degree measure of the four angles of a parallelogram add up to 360 degrees. Remember that all quadrilaterals (4 sided figures) have angles which add up to 360 degrees. Here's a sample:  Then: a + b + c + d = 360 degrees  (2) The degree measure of any two consecutive angles add up to 180 degrees.                 In parallelogram ABCD:  angle a + angle b = 180 degrees  angle b + angle c = 180 degrees  angle c + angle d = 180 degrees  angle a + angle d = 180 degrees  (3) Opposite angles have the same measure in terms of degrees.  In parallelogram ABCD:  (1) Opposite sides are parallel:  side AD || side BC  NOTE: The symbol || means parallel.  (2) Opposite sides have the same lengths:  side AD = side BC  side AB = side CD  Diagonals of a Parallelogram  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two side-by-side triangles.  As shown in the picture below, diagonal AC forms equal alternate interior angles with each pair of parallel sides.  We can also see that there are two triangles in the picture below.  Triangle 1 is congruent to triangle 2 by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Method.  Where did the two triangles come from?  They were formed by diagonal AC.  I should also note that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other as shown in the picture below.  AE = EC  where E is the midpoint of BOTH diagonals.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett. For the reader dedicated to collectible Ian Fleming books, there are many first edition James Bond books in various printings, conditions and price points to suit every collector\'s desires.

In the late eighth century Offa achieved a dominance over southern England that did not survive his death in 796 . In 829 Egbert conquered Mercia , but he soon lost control of it . By the late ninth century Wessex was the dominant Anglo - Saxon kingdom . Its king , Alfred the Great , was overlord of western Mercia and used the title King of the Angles and Saxons , but he never ruled eastern and northern England , which was then the Danelaw .

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy .

The Pirates of Penzance – English National OperaThe Pirates of Penzance | Discover Opera | English National Opera  The Pirates of Penzance  Composer  Gilbert & Sullivan  Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera is packed full of sentimental\xa0pirates, blundering policeman, absurd adventures and improbable paradoxes.  Frederic, a pirate’s apprentice, falls head-over-heels in love with Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley. Frederic is due to be released from his apprenticeship on his 21st birthday, but there’s a snag. Born on 29\xa0February, Frederic discovers that he is technically still a youngster. Although very much in love, his dedication to duty is unshakeable. Can he find a way to live happily-ever-after with Mabel?  Synopsis  Act I  A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall  The pirates offer a toast to Frederic who is celebrating his 21st birthday and the end of his apprenticeship. Ruth, a maid who also works with the pirates, explains that when Frederic was younger she was instructed by his father to have the small boy apprenticed to a pilot, but she misheard and instead took Frederic to a pirate.  Now that his obligation to the pirates has ended, duty compels Frederic to devote himself to destroying them. When the men admit their inability to make piracy pay, Frederic explains that they are themselves slaves to their tender hearts, particularly regarding their refusal to take advantage of anyone they believe to be an orphan. Frederic wishes he could bring the pirates back to a respectable life, but the Pirate King rejects that possibility.  Ruth longs for Frederic to take her with him when he leaves. He admits that he is reluctant to marry her, though he is satisfied that, despite her age, she is beautiful. But when he sees a group of lovely young women approaching, he rages at her for deceiving him.  The young women are astonished to encounter Frederic and horrified to hear that he is a pirate. He assures them that he only wants to love one of them. They all reject him except Mabel.  The pirates surprise the girls and anticipate soon becoming their husbands. Their father, the Major General, enters and objects to the girls being married against their wills to pirates. He lies his way out of the situation by claiming to be an orphan. The girls are released from the pirates’ clutches, as Mabel and Frederic – ignoring the pleas of Ruth – look forward to their marriage.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

It’s a wise saying that few in the tech industry seem to live by. But it’s alright, we don’t mind. The big names’ desire to capitalize on a competitor’s misfortune is often a source of hilarity.  Take #bendgate. By now, you probably know that simply walking around with an iPhone 6 Plus in your pocket could bend it , sometimes irremediably. In typical Internet fashion, the issue spiraled into a storm of 160-character quips, more or less witty memes, and deep social commentary from everyone and their grandma.  Apple’s got its share of snark and derision over #bendgate (or is it #bendghazi?). But you can count on rivals in the Android camp to make it even harder for the folks in Cupertino.

I’m sure you’re all familiar with it by now, but if not, BendGate was created from an alleged bending issue with Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. There’s a specific weak point on the inside of the chassis right beneath the volume buttons that allows it to bend very easily with pressure added in the right place. To most, it may seem like a non-issue, but a single video sparked one of the biggest viral moments this year in tech…  Lewis Hilsenteger from Unbox Therapy published the video that I’ve embedded below this article and that’s when it all got worse. In the video, Hilsenteger clearly bends an iPhone 6 Plus on camera and notes the specific weak point mentioned above. Of course, Hilsenteger (who is a friend and music collaborator ) had absolutely no idea that his video would cause the Internet to implode, but he assumed it would gain a decent amount of traction based on reports of the iPhone 6 Plus’ bendable properties that had been published earlier that day. 45 million views later, BendGate became a PR nightmare for Apple, somewhat of a conspiracy theory (which Hilsenteger debunked ), and a chance for mainstream media to show its true colors…  First off, let’s get one thing straight: The iPhone 6 Plus will bend if enough pressure is applied to a certain area. In fact, a lot of phones will bend when extreme pressure is applied. Everything has a weak point.

Published on Jan 22, 2015  Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen BEST AUDIO  There was once a woman who wished very much to have a little child, but she could not obtain her wish. At last she went to a fairy, and said, "I should so very much like to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?"     "Oh, that can be easily managed," said the fairy. "Here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer\'s fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen."     "Thank you," said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud.     "It is a beautiful flower," said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of "Thumbelina," or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat. Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair. It really was a very pretty sight. Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard.  Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen BEST AUDIO  Please subscribe for more great audio books.

In the first English translation of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale opens with a beggar woman giving a peasant\'s wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants the miniature maiden as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag-beetle. The insect discards her when his friends reject her company. Thumbelina tries to protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old fieldmouse and tends her dwelling in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry | Question: In the Hans Christian Andersen story, who slept in a walnut shell for a cradle?', ['thumbelina'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4402'), ('Context: Fox\'s Glacier MintsFox\'s Glacier Mints are the leading, branded boiled mint in the UK. They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.  Since the majority of consumers said that their favourite sweets were either strawberry or blackcurrant flavoured, Fox\'s has also created a new product | Question: What animal is traditionally seen in the branding of Fox\'s Glacier Mints?', ['polar bear'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2327'), ('Context: QuickBooks sponsored a "Small Business Big Game" contest, in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks.

The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Fulham suffered an inconsistent start to the season , with results such as a 4 -- 0 against local rivals QPR countered by results like a 0 -- 3 home loss to Wolves . After a 2 -- 5 loss at home to Birmingham City , and lying in 12th place , Kit Symons was sacked as Fulham manager in November 2015 . It took 49 days to find a replacement , the club using Peter Grant and Stuart Gray in the interim , before appointing the Serbian Slaviša Jokanović on 27 December 2015 . Fulham 's fortunes did not improve greatly following Jokanović 's appointment , with no league wins until their 3 -- 1 victory over QPR on 13 February 2016 . This poor run of form brought Fulham down to 18th position in the Championship . Aside from a further victory against Charlton Athletic on 20 February 2016 , the club again went winless until their 2 -- 1 victory over relegation strugglers MK Dons , on 2 April 2016 . Fulham finished the 2015 / 16 Championship season in 20th place , avoiding relegation by 11 points . After yet another squad overhaul , the following season saw huge improvements in both results and performances . After a good start , which included a 1 - 0 win over newly - relegated Newcastle , Fulham found themselves in 2nd place at the end of August . A poor September followed , but a significant improvement from October onwards , which included the 5 - 0 thrashings of high - flying Huddersfield Town and Reading , got Fulham back into play - off contention . Fulham secured a 6th place finish after an impressive finish to the season , which saw Fulham collect 37 points out of their last 17 games , and entered the play - offs , where they were undone by a controversial Yann Kermorgant penalty , which saw Reading triumph 2 - 1 on aggregate . After a poor first half of the 2017 / 18 season , which included a 1 - 0 loss away to bottom placed Sunderland on 16 December 2017 , Fulham struggled to break the top half of the table . Following that loss at Sunderland , Fulham went on a club - record 23 game unbeaten run in the league , which included a 6 - 0 romping of Burton Albion and wins against fellow promotion rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers , Aston Villa and Cardiff City . The run ended on the final day of the season , as Fulham fell to a 3 - 1 defeat against Birmingham City . Had Fulham won , they would have finished the season in second place , as Cardiff failed to beat Reading . Instead they would have to face the play - offs for a second season running . After overcoming a 1 - 0 away defeat to Derby County in the semi finals , Fulham won the EFL Championship play - off Final against Aston Villa to return to the Premier League on 26 May 2018 , after securing their first win at Wembley in their 139 year history . | Question: when was the last time fulham played at wembley ?", ['26 May 2018'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-46775'), ("Context: Larsson planned the series as having ten installments , but due to his sudden death in 2004 , only three were completed and published .

This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen . In humans , aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate .

Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced , however , two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase . The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity ( decrease its stability ) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase .

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.

The term "Imperialism" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of "imperialism" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of "imperialism". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power. | Question: What was the idealized value of imperialism?', ['idealism and philanthropy', 'philanthropy'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10015'), ('Context: Black Hills - InfopleaseBlack Hills  Encyclopedia \xa0>\xa0 Places \xa0>\xa0 United States, Canada, and Greenland \xa0>\xa0 U.S. Physical Geography  Black Hills  Black Hills, rugged mountains, c.6,000 sq mi (15,540 sq km), enclosed by the Belle Fourche and Cheyenne rivers, SW S.Dak. and NE Wyo., and rising c.2,500 ft (760 m) above the surrounding Great Plains; Harney Peak, 7,242 ft (2,207 m) above sea level, is the highest point in the Black Hills and in South Dakota. The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

Griffith discovered that a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae could be made virulent after being exposed to heat - killed virulent strains . Griffith hypothesized that some `` transforming principle '' from the heat - killed strain was responsible for making the harmless strain virulent .

They isolated DNA from a virulent strain of S. pneumoniae and using just this DNA were able to make a harmless strain virulent . They called this uptake and incorporation of DNA by bacteria `` transformation '' ( See Avery - MacLeod - McCarty experiment ) . The results of Avery et al.

In 1542, while just six days old, Mary ascended to the Scottish throne upon the death of her father, King James V. Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis’ death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the country’s monarch.  In 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeth’s death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o’ Field, and Mary’s lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.  In 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.  On February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother’s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Who was Mary Queen of Scots?  Mary was known as Queen of Scots because she was Queen of Scotland. For a short time she was also Queen of France. She might have become Queen of England too. Mary's life was full of romance but sadness too. She became famous across Europe, especially after her execution in 1587, for plotting (it was said) against England's Queen Elizabeth I.  When did she live?  Mary was born in 1542, when Henry VIII was King of England. Her father was King James V of Scotland. Mary became Queen of Scotland as a baby. She was Queen until 1567, when she gave up the crown and left Scotland. She spent many years a prisoner in England, where she was put to death on 8 February 1587.  A sad life  Mary never knew her father, who died soon after her birth. As a little girl, she was sent away from her mother to France. Her first husband died two years after their wedding. Her second husband was murdered. Her third husband ran off with her, then deserted her. The Scots rejected her, and the English locked her up. Mary Queen of Scots' sad life ended when she was beheaded in 1587.  Princess in Scotland  Where was Mary born?  Mary was born at Linlithgow Palace in Scotland on 8 December 1542. Mary's father was King James V of Scotland. Mary's mother, Mary of Guise, was French. Mary was related to the English king, Henry VIII, through her English grandmother, a member of the Tudor family.

This line stretches from the hip joint ( or more precisely the head of the femur ) , through the knee joint ( the intercondylar eminence of the tibia ) , and down to the center of the ankle ( the ankle mortise , the fork - like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli ) . In the tibial shaft , the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide , but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6 ° , resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174 ° in a leg with normal axial alignment . A leg is considered straight when , with the feet brought together , both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching . Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis ( intermalleolar distance exceeds 3 cm ) , and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis ( intercondylar distance exceeds 5 cm ) . These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh 's adductors and abductors . The angle of inclination formed between the neck and shaft of the femur , ( collodiaphysial angle ) , varies with age -- about 150 ° in the newborn , it gradually decreases to 126 - 128 ° in adults , to reach 120 ° in old age . Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg : A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga ; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum . Additionally , a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle , the torsion angle , which makes it possible for flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head .

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan. There are multiple theories, however, and we go over some of them in our FAQ on the topic:  Why are mulligans called that?

In the first half of the 1860s , Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states ; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home . In responding to the Schleswig - Holstein Question , they both proved equally diligent in doing so . After the victory over Austria in 1866 , Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests , while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans . The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states ( aside from Austria ) to the international level . With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser , Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire . The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 ( signed 26 February 1871 ; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 ) , which formally ended the war . Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state , he had not done it alone . Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein . The difficulties of the Vormärz , the impact of the 1848 liberals , the importance of von Roon 's military reorganization , and von Moltke 's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification . | Question: who is credited with creating germany and in what year ?", ['Bismarck'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-7972'), ("Context: Alexandre - Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois , a French geologist , was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements -- similar elements occurring at regular intervals when they are ordered by their atomic weights .

With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight , de Chancourtois saw that elements with similar properties lined up vertically . His 1863 publication included a chart ( which contained ions and compounds , in addition to elements ) , but his original paper in the Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram .

The Kalahari is a massive area of semi-arid savanna covering parts of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.  The Kalahari Desert in Namibia.  5. Description  The Kalahari Desert stretches across an area of 900,000 square kilometers, in the three African countries of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. Up to 70% of the land in Botswana, the eastern third of Namibia, and the northernmost parts of South Africa are all occupied by this desert. The Kalahari, unlike a true desert, has a semi-arid climate that supports vast tracts of sandy savanna, and a considerable diversity of flora and fauna lives therein. The landscape of the Kalahari is mostly flat, with an average elevation of around 1,000 meters above sea level in most parts of the desert. The Boteti River, in Botswana, is the only permanent surface water source in the desert.  4. Historical Role  Scientists estimate that the Kalahari Desert was formed between 65 and 135 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period. Since then, the desert has faced both periods of higher precipitation and greater aridity than the present prevailing conditions. It is possible that the dry riverbeds of the Kalahari and the Makgadikgadi Depression were formed during such periods of higher precipitation. Historical evidence proves that the San Bushmen of Africa were the ancient occupants of the Kalahari Desert region. The Bantu people, including tribes like the Tswana, the Kgalagadi, and the Herero, are currently residents of the desert along with the traditional San people, and these others arrived much later, towards the end of the 18th Century. In 1849, David Livingstone, a Scottish medical missionary, and William C. Oswell, an English explorer, were the first Europeans to cross the Kalahari Desert. In more recent years, Europeans arrived in the Kalahari primarily for commercial purposes, and only a single European settlement (in the Ghanzi District) existed in the region as late as the 1890’s.  3. Modern Significance  Presently, the Kalahari Desert serves as the homeland for Bantu-speaking African tribes and the Khoisan-speaking San people. The vast stretches of savanna in the region allow the locals to rear cattle and goats for meat and milk. Corn, sorghum, and pumpkins are also cultivated by most households in the region. The Kalahari Desert is home to large deposits of precious metals and diamonds. The first diamond mine was opened here in Orapa in 1971. Tourism also adds to the economy of the region. Besides the economical significance of the Kalahari, the desert is also extremely significant from the ecological and environmental points of view. The sands of the desert are packed with cyanobacteria which can fix atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus acting as a natural carbon sink for much of the world. The desert also houses some rare and endangered animals in its game reserves, including the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the Khutse Game Reserve, and the Kgalagadi Trans-frontier Park.  2. Habitat and Biodiversity  While the southwestern half of the Kalahari meets the requirements to be qualified as a desert, the northeastern portion of it receives a significant amount of precipitation, and thus cannot qualify as a true desert. There are great diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature throughout the Kalahari. While in summers day temperatures range between 43° and 46° Celsius, and night temperatures fall to between 21 degrees and 27° Celsius, in winters night temperatures can be as low as -12° Celsius. The arid areas of the southwestern Kalahari Desert support very little plant life, and are covered by vast stretches of xeric savanna comprised by xerophytic plants like savanna grasses, grey camelthorn, shepherd’s trees, and silver cluster-leafs. Several species of acacia grow in the less arid, central Kalahari region as well. The more humid northern parts of the desert, however, have large woodlands, palm trees, and even forests with evergreen and deciduous trees. Lions, cheetahs, giraffes, zebras, elephants, leopards, meerkats, and antelopes are just some of the mammalian species found in the northern Kalahari Desert | Question: The Kalahari Desert lies chiefly in which country?', ['botswana'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5997'), ("Context: Death - Discworld & Terry Pratchett WikiDeath - Discworld & Terry Pratchett Wiki  Death  Death Illustrated by Christopher Stryjewski a.k.a. whtmnk  Name  As old as the death of the first living thing  Occupation  Releasing the spirits of dead beings  Physical appearance  Tall, not what you'd call fleshy, Talks like this  Residence  Never Married... for some reason...  Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

BARBINA  A long type of strand pasta almost identical to capellini, usually sold in a coiled shape - to look like a nest.  BAVETTE  Effectively flattened spaghetti, and virtually identical to linguine.  BIGOLI  Bigoli is the Venetian name for a long pasta shape slightly thicker than spaghetti. Bigoli were traditionally made with buckwheat flour but these days makers often use wholewheat flour instead, giving bigoli a slightly darker finish than standard durum wheat spaghetti.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.

The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.

See More  Solitaire (Jane Seymour) - James Bond Wiki - WikiaSolitaire (Jane Seymour) | James Bond Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Solitaire is a fictional character in the James Bond novel and film Live and Let Die . In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it. After Bond kills Tee Hee, he rescues her out of the bed and they soon make out.

Although the dockyard has long been closed and is now being redeveloped into a business and residential community as well as a museum featuring the famous submarine, HMS Ocelot, major naval buildings remain as the focus for a flourishing tourist industry. Chatham Dockyard, located on the River Medway and of which two-thirds is in Gillingham and one third in Chatham, Kent, England, came into existence at the time when, following the Reformation, relations with the Catholic countries of Europe had worsened, making it neccessary to acquire additional defences.  For 414 years Chatham Dockyard provided over 500 ships for the Royal Navy, and was forefront of shipbuilding, industrial and architectural technology. At its height, it employed over 10,000 skilled artisans and covered 400 acres or 1.6 km². Chatham dockyard closed in 1984, and 84 acres or 340,000 m2 of the Georgian dockyard is now managed as a visitor attraction by the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust. Chatham also has military connections; several Army barracks were located here, together with 19th century forts which provided a defensive shield for the dockyard. Brompton Barracks, located in the town, remains the headquarters of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The town has important road links and the railway and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area. It is the administrative headquarters of Medway unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping center. The Treasurer of the Navy's accounts of the King's Exchequer for the year of 1544 identifies Deptford as the Dockyard that carried out all the major repairs to the King's Ships that year.  That was soon to change, although Deptford remained a dockyard for over three centuries. In 1547 Jillingham water, as Chatham Dockyard was then known, is mentioned as second only in importance to Deptford; followed by Woolwich, Portsmouth and Harwich. In 1550 ships that were then lying off Portsmouth were ordered to be harboured in Jillingham Water, by reason of its superior strategic location. Chatham was established as a royal dockyard by Elizabeth I in 1567. She herself visited the yard in 1573. By the late 17th century it was the largest refitting dockyard and very important during the Dutch wars. The Medway, apart from Chatham Dockyard, has always had an important role in transportation: historically it provided a means for the transport of goods to and from the interior of Kent.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000.

J Retail Leisure Property (2007) 6: 327. doi:10.1057/palgrave.rlp.5100074  94 Downloads  Abstract  This paper explores the use of maritime heritage tourism as a tool for regenerating the post-industrial city of Dundee in relation to its history and to present efforts of re-imaging. Although Dundee has historically benefited from its proximity to the River Tay, since its demise as a port, regeneration strategies so far embraced have tended to focus on the centre, and in particular the development of retail and latterly, the city's new ‘cultural quarter’. A new phase in urban renewal has brought about increased interest in the waterfront area which seeks to extend the existing focal point further east down the riverside beyond that of the Discovery Point Heritage Centre which showcases Captain Scott's ship ‘The Discovery’ as Dundee's main maritime visitor attraction and a key part of the city's former brand campaign as ‘City of Discovery’. The city has opted for a multifaceted strategy of development that includes a broader focus on leisure rather than solely heritage tourism per se, perhaps in recognition of the city's inability to establish a buoyant tourism base. Drawing upon original qualitative research, the paper critiques the approach being adopted and analyses the relationship between maritime heritage and a broader emphasis on leisure development. It assesses whether this is likely to promote a sustainable initiative of urban vibrancy and renewal rather than the present reality of a former industrial city in decline.  Keywords  INTRODUCTION 1  ‘Certain elements in the Scottish past have suffered particular violence … some aspects are particularly distorted, while others, which should be prominent, hardly figure at all.’ 2  Dundee suffered from continuous economic decline in the latter decades of the 20th century. The last jute factories traditionally associated with the city had by then closed down along with other related industries. In the late 1980s and 1990s, policy makers in Dundee adopted various strategies to promote the city. For example, they began investing in the three ‘T's of teaching, tourism and technology, due to the decline in importance of the formerly dominant three ‘J's of jute, jam and journalism for which the city had become famous. The ‘Dundee Project’, first launched in 1981 was aimed at saving the city from cumulative social and economic decline by fundamentally changing its image. This strategy looked to Dundee's past, but in so doing embraced the city's maritime rather than its industrial heritage as a base upon which to build its regeneration. The ‘Dundee Project’ in 1991 evolved into the ‘Dundee Partnership’, a joint initiative responsible for city and community planning among the key agencies of the Dundee City Council, Scottish Enterprise Tayside, Tayside Police and NHS Tayside. This was followed by a promotional campaign for the city that was to brand it as the ‘City of Discovery’. This brand name was derived from Captain's Scott's ship, the ‘Discovery’, which was built in Dundee. The ‘Discovery’ was berthed in 1993 on Discovery Quay beside the purpose-built Discovery Point museum and heritage centre. This is now Dundee's main maritime visitor attraction and a key part of the city's former brand campaign as ‘City of Discovery’. The attraction focuses on Dundee's 19th century shipbuilding past. It shows visitors also how the city became a major centre for whaling and furthermore had a large merchant fleet that was later to keep the town's industries supplied with raw materials. 3  In 1993, at the same time as the ‘Discovery’ was being berthed, a bitter dispute was being enacted that was to lead to the final closure in Dundee of Timex, a multinational watch manufacturer with | Question: Which UK city is traditionally associated with jute, jam and journalism?", ['dundee'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5036'), ('Context: Willem Dafoe and Jason Liles as Ryuk : A demonic god of death and the creator of the Death Note , who begins communicating with Light when he receives the book and warns him about its repercussions .

In the book By the Time We Got to Woodstock: The Great Rock \'n\' Roll Revolution of 1969 , Bruce Pollock writes:  Among the many people calling the publisher in 1968 for a lock of Hair\'s mystique was the L.A. producer Bones Howe, who\'d been working with the 5th Dimension since engineering " Up-Up and Away " for their first album in 1967. He\'d produced hits for the Turtles (" It Ain\'t Me Babe ") and the Association (" Windy "); he\'d been a personal guest of Lou Adler at the Monterey Pop Festival where he was perhaps the only West Coast guy in attendance to appreciate Laura Nyro\'s gruesome performance. Later he delivered Laura\'s "Stoned Soul Picnic" to the 5th Dimension, for which it was their biggest r&b hit. He was shuttling back and forth between his home in L.A. and the studio in New York working on the vocals for the Stoned Soul Picnic album when the group told him they wanted to do "Aquarius."  "The thing that bothered me about it was that there\'d been other releases of \'Aquarius,\'" said Bones, "and none had done anything, so I was concerned about what we would do that would be any different. I went to see the show and there\'s a place where they do "The Flesh Failures" and at the end of the song is just a three bar repeated thing of \'Let the sunshine in\' where Ragni was swinging across the stage on a chandelier and there was all kinds of craziness going on. That really stayed with me and I came out of the theater saying, I wonder if I could stick that on the end of \'Aquarius\' and make that the ending. So I went back to the hotel and I called the publisher. I mean you don\'t mess with the music from a Broadway show. I started my professional career in 1956 and I knew a lot about what you can and what you can\'t do with songs. I said, look the 5th Dimension would like to record \'Aquarius,\' but I\'d like to make it a medley and I\'d like to use the last three bars of \'The Flesh Failures\' and I don\'t want to do it without permission. So he said okay, you can go ahead and do it."  The next problem was to go ahead and do it. "The record was plotted in the fall of \'68 and more or less finished in January of \'69," Bones said. "I had to do a lot of work with my vocal arranger, Bob Alsivar. Because they couldn\'t sing both songs in the same key, we had to do a modulation; we figured out how I was going to do the instrumental arrangement so we could change keys. The record itself is the result of a conglomeration of things. I began as a jazz musician and I know the standard repertoire pretty well. I kept thinking about a song called \'Lost in the Stars\' and trying to find something to give you that kind of impression. I described it to Bill Holman and he wrote that beautiful woodwinds and strings part that\'s in the intro. We did the track in L.A. and the vocals in Las Vegas where the 5th Dimension were opening for Frank Sinatra. We were working in that studio in Las Vegas where you used to have to stop when the train went by. Once when we were doing practice runs while the train passed Billy started that riff at the end \'oh let the sunshine…\' so I said, wait, let me put that on a separate track at the end.

A major factor in this rejection of the tradition of Mosaic authorship was the development of the documentary hypothesis , which understood the Pentateuch as a composite work made up of four `` sources , '' or documents , compiled over centuries in a process that was not concluded until long after Moses ' death . The documentary hypothesis aroused understandable opposition from traditional scholars . One of the most significant was David Zvi Hoffmann ( 1843 - 1921 ) , who attempted to defend Mosaic authorship by demonstrating that the sources identified by the documentary hypothesis were , in fact , pre-exilic ; if this were proven , he believed , then the hypothesis itself was dis - proven . The most he would concede to the proponents of the hypothesis was that Moses may have written various scrolls over his career and that these may have been collated and united before his death . Another important Jewish scholar , and one still active , is David Weiss Halivni ( b. 1927 ) : he has developed a theory of Chate'u Yisrael , literally , `` Israel has sinned '' , which states that the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours and neglected the Torah of Moses , with the result that it became `` blemished and maculated ; '' only on the return from Babylon did the people once again accept the Torah , which was then recompiled and edited by Ezra as evidenced in Ezra -- Nehemiah and Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah . He further states that while the text of the Torah was corrupted , oral tradition was preserved intact , which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details . Menachem Mendel Kasher ( 1895 - 1983 ) , taking a different approach , accepted the documentary hypothesis but adapted it to the Mosaic tradition , pointing to certain traditions of the Oral Torah which show Moses quoting Genesis prior to the epiphany at Sinai ; based on a number of Bible verses and rabbinic statements , he therefore suggested that Moses made use of documents authored by the Patriarchs when redacting that book .

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database. There is no transcript for a trial of a Sweeney Todd, nor for that matter any similar crimes.

A:  Quick Answer  In the Greek mythology story of Theseus and the Minotaur, King Minos of Crete ordered the labyrinth to be built as a way of housing a fierce half-man, half-bull creature known as the Minotaur, to whom seven young men and seven young women from Athens would be sacrificed each year. According to the myth, the labyrinth is a massive maze-like structure built by a man named Daedalus at the behest of King Minos; the maze that Daedalus constructed was so incredibly complex that even he could barely make his way through it. The hero Theseus ends up offering himself as a tribute to be sacrificed in the labyrinth, though his intention is to kill the Minotaur or die trying.

Europa's husband was the king of Crete, Asterion, who looked over the boys as he his own. \xa0The three sons were Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus.\xa0These three men, after death were made judge in the underworld.

This confirmed to all concerned that Minos was their true king.

So Poseidon turned the bull wild and\xa0implanted sexual desire \xa0towards bull in\xa0 Pasiphae (wife of Minos).\xa0Pasiphae mated with bull and gave birth to\xa0Asterius, who was called Minotaur (Minotaur was a monster half man and half bull).\xa0  Pasiphae and the Bull  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Pasiphae nursed Minotaur, but he grew and became ferocious, being the unnatural offspring of a woman and a beast, he had no natural source of nourishment and thus devoured man for sustenance.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: The contraction of cardiac muscle ( heart muscle ) in all animals is initiated by electrical impulses known as action potentials .

Pope's paternal grandfather is supposed to have been Alexander Pope, rector of Thruxton, Hampshire (instituted 1 May 1630–1; information from the Winchester bishop's register, communicated by Mr. J. C. Smith, of Somerset House), who died in 1645. The poet's father, according to his epitaph, was seventy-five at his death, 23 Oct. 1717, and therefore born in 1641 or 1642 (see also P. T.'s letter to Curll in Pope's Works, by Elwin and Courthope, vi. 423, where he is said to have been a posthumous son). According to Warton, he was a merchant at Lisbon, where he was converted to catholicism. He was afterwards a linendraper in Broad Street, London. A first wife, Magdalen, was buried 12 Aug. 1679 (register of St. Benet Fink); he had by her a daughter Magdalen, afterwards Mrs. Rackett; and in the Pangbourne register, Ambrose Staveley, the rector, records the burial of 'Alexander Pope, son of my brother-in law, Alexander Pope, merchant of London,' on 1 Sept. 1682 ( information from Mr. J. C. Smith). Pope's statement in a note in the Epistle to Arbuthnot, that his father belonged to the family of the earls of Downe, appears to have been a fiction (Warton, Essay, ii. 255). The poet's maternal grandfather descended from a family of small landowners in Yorkshire. He had seventeen children, one of whom, Edith, the poet's mother, was baptised on 18 June 1642, though, according to her epitaph, she was ninety-three at her death on 7 June 1733. Christiana, another daughter, married the portrait-painter, Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) [q. v.], and at her death in 1693, left some china, pictures, and medals to her nephew. Three of her sons, according to Pope's statement (Epistle to Arbuthnot), were in the service of Charles I. Alexander Pope, the linendraper, after his second marriage, moved his business to Lombard Street. He made some money by his trade, and in or before 1700 moved to Binfield in Windsor Forest. It appears from his will (Carruthers, Pope, 1857, p. 463) that he had some landed property, and he also invested money in French rentes (Works, vi. 189, 201). The story, first told by Ruffhead, that he put all his money in a strong-box and lived upon the principal, is therefore erroneous. As a catholic, he was exposed to various disqualifications; but he appears to have lived comfortably among the country gentry. He had many friends among the Roman catholics, several of whom lived near the forest. He was fond of gardening, and had twenty acres of land round his house at Binfield. One room of the house is said to remain, and a row of Scottish firs near it was apparently there in Pope's time.  Pope was precocious, and in his infancy healthy. He was called the ‘little nightingale’ from the beauty of his voice, a name still applied to him in later years by the dramatist Southern (Ruffhead, p. 476; Orrery, Swift, p. 207). A portrait, painted when he was ten years old, showed him ‘plump and pretty, and of a fresh complexion.’ This is said to have been like him at the time; but a severe illness two years later, brought on by ‘perpetual application,’ ruined his health and distorted his figure (Spence | Question: What was the first name of the poet Mr. Pope, 1688-1744?", ['alexander'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1860'), ("Context: By volume , dry air contains 78.09 % nitrogen , 20.95 % oxygen , 0.93 % argon , 0.04 % carbon dioxide , and small amounts of other gases .

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000. Westwood has performed particularly well in European Tour events, having won a total of 18 tournaments, and in 2000 he achieved the European Tour Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s seven year run of victory.

Many of the scenes were shot near the battleship USS North Carolina and on the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus .

With the beginning of the fifth season , Schwahn advanced the timeline by four years to show their lives after college , and he made it jump a further fourteen months from the end of the sixth to the start of the seventh season . The opening credits were originally accompanied by the song `` I Do n't Want to Be '' by Gavin DeGraw . The theme was removed from the opening in the fifth season ; Schwahn said that this was to lower production costs , to add more time for the storyline , and because he felt that the song was more representative of the core characters ' adolescent past than their present maturity . The credits then consisted only of the title written on a black background .

Secession from the United States was accepted in eleven states ( and failed in two others ) . The seceding states joined together to form the Confederate States of America ( CSA ) . The eleven states of the CSA , in order of secession , were : South Carolina ( seceded December 20 , 1860 ) , Mississippi ( seceded January 9 , 1861 ) , Florida ( seceded January 10 , 1861 ) , Alabama ( seceded January 11 , 1861 ) , Georgia ( seceded January 19 , 1861 ) , Louisiana ( seceded January 26 , 1861 ) , Texas ( seceded February 1 , 1861 ) , Virginia ( seceded April 17 , 1861 ) , Arkansas ( seceded May 6 , 1861 ) , North Carolina ( seceded May 20 , 1861 ) , and Tennessee ( seceded June 8 , 1861 ) . Secession was declared by pro-Confederate governments in Missouri and Kentucky ( see Confederate government of Missouri and Confederate government of Kentucky ) , but did not become effective as it was opposed by their pro-Union state governments . This secession movement brought about the American Civil War . The position of the Union was that the Confederacy was not a sovereign nation -- and never had been , but that `` the Union '' was always a single nation by intent of the states themselves , from 1776 onward -- and thus that a rebellion had been initiated by individuals . Historian Bruce Catton described President Abraham Lincoln 's April 15 , 1861 , proclamation after the attack on Fort Sumter , which defined the Union 's position on the hostilities : | Question: when did the 11 states seceded from the union ?", ['1860', '1861'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-39182'), ("Context: A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae , in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae .

Many versions conclude the game when the first person achieves a specified pattern from the drawn numbers. The winner is usually required to call out the word "Bingo!", which alerts the other players and caller of a possible win.  All wins are checked to make sure the person has not made a mistake before the win is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun. In this version of bingo, players compete against one another for the prize or jackpot.  Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement.  Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each jurisdiction\'s gambling laws regulating how the game is played.  There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play.  Some games require only one number to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern. See "Variations" for more details.  Bingo cards  The most common Bingo cards are flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper which contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical columns and five side to side rows. Each space in the grid contains a number.  A typical Bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75.  The five columns of the card are labeled \'B\', \'I\', \'N\', \'G\', and \'O\' from left to right.  The center space is usually marked "Free" or "Free Space", and is considered automatically filled.  The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the \'B\' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the \'I\' column containing only 16 through 30, \'N\' containing 31 through 45, \'G\' containing 46 through 60, and \'O\' containing 61 through 75.  The number of all possible Bingo cards with these standard features is P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,4) = 552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 or approximately 5.52×1026.  In U-Pick \'Em bingo and other variants of bingo, players are issued three 25 number cards which contain all 75 numbers that may be drawn.  Players then mark which numbers they wish to play and then daub those numbers according to the numbers drawn. In addition, double-action cards have two numbers in each square.  A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal. The most chips one can place on a Bingo board without having a Bingo is 19, not counting the free space. In order for this to happen, only one empty cell can reside in each row and each column, and at least one empty cell must be in each diagonal, for instance:  B I N G O  ● ● \xa0 ● ●  ● \xa0 ● ● ●  ● ● □ ● \xa0  ● ● ● \xa0 ●  \xa0 ● ● ● ●  In addition to a straight line, other patterns may be considered a valid bingo in special games. For example, in the illustration above, the 2x2 square of marked squares in the upper-right-hand corner would be considered a "postage stamp". Another common special game requires players to cover the four corners. There are several other patterns, such as a Roving \'L\', which requires players to cover all B\'s and top or bottom row or all O\'s and top or bottom row.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds. The name “unmodified round brilliant” was applied to a symmetrical round cut with a regular array of 58 facets, cut to modern standards. The system was the culmination of years of research that included the results of preference testing among a wide variety of groups, including trade professionals and consumers.  GIA designed the system to assess the design quality and craftsmanship of diamonds cut in the standard round brilliant style when compared to modern preferences. | Question: A modern round brilliant cut has 58 what?", ['facets'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3808'), ("Context: Each half - inning formally starts when the umpire calls `` Play '' or `` Play ball '' .

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.  On the 24th April 1567, Mary was kidnapped by Bothwell (it is | Question: What was the name of the letters that in 1566 implicated Mary Queen of Scots in the murder of her second husband, Lord Darnley?', ['casket letters'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1935'), ("Context: Glenwood Springs was originally known as `` Defiance '' , a name sometimes still used by local teams or businesses .

The National Board of Review threw everything for a loop by naming a documentary, The True Glory, as their Best Picture, but The Lost Weekend came in second and won Best Actor.\xa0 The New York Film Critics were more impressed, giving it Best Picture, Director and Actor.\xa0 The Golden Globes concurred, naming it as the winner of the same three awards.

Suggs Biography (Wikipedia)  Graham McPherson (born 13 January 1961), better known as Suggs, is an English singer-songwriter, musician, radio personality and actor.  In a career spanning more than 30 years, Suggs came to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead singer of the English ska band Madness, which released fifteen singles that entered the Top 10 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1970s, 1980s and the 1990s, including "My Girl", "Baggy Trousers", "Embarrassment", "It Must Be Love", "House of Fun", "Driving in My Car", "Our House", "Wings of a Dove" and "Lovestruck". Suggs began his solo career in 1995, while still a member of Madness. Since then, he has released two studio albums, and two compilation albums. His solo hits include "I\'m Only Sleeping", "Camden Town", "Cecilia" and "Blue Day".  Suggs has also been an actor, with roles in films, theatre and television. He has married once and is the father of two children.  This entry is from Wikipedia , the user-contributed encyclopedia.

"Thirty bloody years I\'ve been wiv \'em." For a moment I think he\'s talking about his band, those baggy-trousered nutty boys; turns out he means his bank. They kept him waiting an hour and a half, despite three decades as a loyal customer – "and despite us shooting some of our best videos there as well".  But that\'s not the whole story of his tardiness for our rendezvous at Quo Vadis, his Soho club. En route from his home in Camden he bumped into Graham Coxon from Blur and an earnest discussion about the perils of the rock reunion soon necessitated strong drink. And there was another impediment for Suggs – an injured hand.  "Last night I was on the Mall with Buckingham Palace up ahead and Admiralty Arch – where John Prescott bonked his secretary – behind me and I just thought: \'London, my London – what tales lie therein.\' So when I saw this big pile of leaves I was so exhilarated that I just dived in. And that\'s how I hurt my hand."  Days can sometimes blend into nights for Suggs. I deduce this from the following greeting to Quo Vadis\'s manager: "Oi, Eduardo! You\'re still wearing last night\'s shirt with last night\'s stain – you dirty slag!" And once a day/night at least, he probably begins a sentence thus: "London, my London..."  London has always featured in Madness songs and they\'ve marked their 30th anniversary with The Liberty Of Norton Folgate, something of a London concept album, earning the band – Edinburgh\'s star attraction for the world\'s biggest Hogmanay street party – the best reviews of their career.  But how does Suggs respond to all London-loathers who think it too big, dirty, expensive, impersonal and up itself?

They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights.

An exceptional copy in scarce original dust jacket, with original Book Society belly band.  Du Maurier’s most popular novel, and one that paved the way for a renaissance of romantic mystery in mid-20th century publishing, Rebecca “subtly subverts the classic rags-to-riches or Cinderella theme to provide an eerie… almost Gothic narrative” (Parker & Kermode, 211). The novel proved to critics that “Du Maurier is in a class by herself” (New York Times); her “masterful treatment” of her tale“made Rebecca a classic book” (Steinbrunner & Penzler, 136). “‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.’ The opening line of perhaps the greatest romantic suspense novel ever written has become as familiar to readers as ‘Call me Ishmael’ from Moby-Dick” (Penzler, Crown, 26).

The original abbey was burned down in 1307, and the present building dates from the 15th century.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0By the early 18th century Paisley had developed into a manufacturing centre for the hand-loom weaving of linen. At the end of the century the new town was laid out over much of the ground that once belonged to the abbey. Paisley became famous for its paisley shawls in silk and cotton (and later in wool), which were copies of the Asian shawls sent by British soldiers serving in India. A priceless collection is on exhibit in the Paisley Museum and Art Galleries. Later the manufacture of linen thread gave way to that of cotton, and Paisley grew rapidly.

"It\'s the deadliest thing in the sea," according to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in Washington. "Victims usually experience shock, muscular cramps, numbness, nausea, vomiting, severe backache, frothing at the mouth, constriction of the throat, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, paralysis, delirium, convulsion and, finally, death."  Dozens of people are killed each year by these transparent, grapefruit-size predators. So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  "Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks," said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. "That\'s because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim\'s susceptibility to the creature\'s venom."  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp\'s venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra\'s, only deadlier.  "Even a mild brush can cause intense pain," writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. "The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time."  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp\'s long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  "Stay out of those waters at all costs," advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World\'s Most Dangerous Creatures. "Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don\'t actually come after humans to attack."  Syndicated writer Randall Floyd lives in Augusta.

As you are probably fully aware, the former indefinitely suspended quarterback had his suspension cut to the first two games of the 2009 NFL season by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for his actions related to his much publicized dogfighting case that cost him almost two years in a Leavenworth, Kansas prison.\xa0 \xa0  The July 2009 signing of the controversial quarterback by the Philadelphia Eagles, long known as a “High Character” team for years, was a total shock to Philly fans and media.\xa0 The signing fueled a firestorm of talk radio, chat room, and water cooler discussions everywhere, with the question of “Why bring in a distraction of this magnitude?”\xa0  However, after an initial fire storm of publicity about the signing—people saying they would turn in their season tickets, picketing threats, etc—Vick’s presence on the Eagles\' roster seemed to have been  minimized.\xa0 The former highest paid player in the NFL “quietly” went about his business of re-acclimating into the NFL as the Birds\' third or fourth quarterback.\xa0 Plus, doing some much needed PR work related to curbing dog fighting in urban communities.  There is no doubt that the Eagles went out on a limb to sign the infamous quarterback earlier this summer not as social commentary, but as an insurance policy.\xa0 And like it usually does, fate stepped in and any chances of the Eagles continuing to bring Vick along slowly were thrown out the door in Week one of the regular season.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0  Eagles\' starting quarterback Donovan McNabb was injured (broken rib) in a win over the Panthers . As McNabb laid on the ground, several eyes looked to Philadelphia Eagles Owner Jeff Lurie’s suite at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, NC.\xa0  You could almost hear, “Paging Michael Vick…Paging Michael Vick” through the television even though the former three-time Pro Bowl player was not eligible until Week three (KC Chiefs).\xa0  Well, week three of the NFL regular season is here, and Eagles head coach Andy Reid will probably be redeeming the Eagles’ Vick insurance policy as the team looks for a win before their bye week (week four).\xa0  McNabb’s rib injury has lingered, and Eagles fill-in starter Kevin Kolb played up and down in a lopsided loss to the New Orleans Saints in week two, so Vick better be ready for the heat of the NFL regular season.\xa0 If game preparations go as expected, look for Kolb to start, Vick to be the backup, and newly signed backup Jeff Garcia to be the “emergency” quarterback.\xa0  Vick—career passing numbers of 930-1730, 54 percent, 11505 yards, 71 TDs, 52 INTs | Question: What team does controversial quarterback Michael Vick play for in the National Football League in the USA?', ['philadelphia eagles'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3213'), ('Context: Twelfth grade , senior year , or grade 12 is the final year of secondary school in North America .

During fetal development the foundations of the mind are laid as billions of neurons form appropriate connections and patterns. No aspect of this complicated structure has been left to chance. The basic wiring plan is encoded in the genes. It has been shown from previous studies that in developing embryos of animals, nerve cells are created in or travel to designated regions of the brain, and once in place send out axons along preprogrammed paths to make contact with specific targets.  The brain\'s billions of neurons connect with one another in complex networks. All physical and mental functioning depends on the establishment and maintenance of neuron networks. A person\'s habits and skills -- such as nail-biting or playing a musical instrument -- become embedded within the brain in frequently activated neuron networks. When a person stops performing an activity, the neural networks for the activity fall into disuse and eventually may disappear.  Differences in weight and size of a person\'s brain does not correlate with differences in mental ability. The adult human brain normally weighs from 1.0 to 1.5\xa0kg (2¼ to 3¼\xa0lbs).  The work of the brain is similar to a combination of a computer and a chemical factory. So take good care of your PC!  Anicia Ndabahaliye -- 2002  How Many Neurons Are in the Brain? - VerywellHow Many Neurons Are in the Brain?  How Many Neurons Are in the Brain?  Search the site  By Kendra Cherry - Reviewed by a board-certified physician.  Updated March 11, 2016  How many neurons are in the human brain? Older estimates have long suggested that 100 billion was the magic number, but some more recent research suggests that the brain actually contains fewer neurons than previously believed.  The human brain is made up of a complex network of neurons . These neurons serve as the building blocks of the nervous system, transmitting information to and from the brain and throughout the body.  You probably expect that a large number of neurons are required for such a complex process, but just how many neurons are there in the human brain?  How Many Neurons are in the Human Brain?  According to many estimates, the human brain contains around 100 billion neurons (give or take a few billion). This estimate has often been reported for many years in neuroscience and psychology textbooks and for many years was simply accepted as a relatively close approximation.  Recently, however, Brazilian researcher Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel discovered that these estimates might not be entirely accurate. While the number is widely cited, she found that no one seemed to know where this number originated. She then decided to investigate in order to determine if the number is accurate. | Question: The human brain is made up of between 10 billion and 100 billion nerve cells known as what?', ['nerve cells', 'neuron', 'neurons'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1877'), ('Context: Set in the Northwestern United States in 1875 , the film focuses on taciturn widower Matt Calder ( Robert Mitchum ) , who has recently been released from prison after serving time for killing one man while defending another .

The members of the order strive to cultivate the ideals of the order’s founder. The Franciscans actually consist of three orders. The First Order comprises priests and lay brothers who have sworn to lead a life of prayer, preaching, and penance. This First Order is divided into three independent branches: the Friars Minor (O.F.M.), the Friars Minor Conventual (O.F.M. Conv.), and the Friars Minor Capuchin (O.F.M. Cap.). The Second Order consists of cloistered nuns who belong to the Order of St. Clare (O.S.C.) and are known as Poor Clares (P.C.). The Third Order consists of religious and lay men and women who try to emulate Saint Francis’ spirit by performing works of teaching, charity, and social service. Strictly speaking, the latter order consists of the Third Order Secular , whose lay members live in the world without vows; and the Third Order Regular, whose members live in religious communities under vow. Congregations of these religious men and women are numerous all over the Roman Catholic world. The Franciscans are the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic church. They have contributed six popes to the church.  It was probably in 1207 that Francis felt the call to a life of preaching, penance, and total poverty. He was soon joined by his first followers, to whom he gave a short and simple rule of life. In 1209 he and 11 of his followers journeyed to Rome, where Francis received approval of his rule from Pope Innocent III . Under this rule, Franciscan friars could own no possessions of any kind, either individually or communally (i.e., as the property of the order as a whole). The friars wandered and preached among the people, helping the poor and the sick. They supported themselves by working and by begging food, but they were forbidden to accept money either as payment for work or as alms. The Franciscans worked at first in Umbria and then in the rest of Italy and abroad. The impact of these street preachers and especially of their founder was immense, so that within 10 years they numbered 5,000. Affiliated with them were the Franciscan nuns, whose order was founded at Assisi in 1212, by St. Clare , who was under the guidance of St. Francis. Clare and her followers were lodged by Francis in the Church of San Damiano, where they lived a severe life of total poverty. They later became known as the Poor Clares or the Order of St. Clare.  Similar Topics  Cistercian  During the first years of the Franciscans, the example of Francis provided their real rule of life, but, as the order grew, it became clear that a revised rule was necessary. After preparing a rule in 1221 that was found too strict, Francis, with the help of several legal scholars, unwillingly composed the more restrained final rule in 1223. This rule was approved by Pope Honorius III .  Even before the death of Francis in 1226, conflicts had developed within the order over the observance of the vow of complete poverty . The rapid expansion of the order’s membership had created a need for settled monastic houses, but it was impossible to justify these if Francis’ rule of complete poverty was followed strictly. Three parties gradually appeared: the Zealots , who insisted on a literal observance of the primitive rule of poverty affecting communal as well as personal poverty; the Laxists, who favoured many mitigations; and the Moderates, or the Community , who wanted a legal structure that would permit some form of communal possessions. Something of an equilibrium was reached between these different schools of thought while St. Bonaventure was minister general (1257–74). Sometimes called the second founder of the order, he provided a wise, moderate interpretation of the rule. During this period the friars spread throughout Europe, while missionaries penetrated Syria and Africa.

The decade was marked by sweeping social change and the domination of youth culture - baby boomers were growing up and demanded their own fashion style.  Designers responded with a much more liberal, daring approach to fashion, boasting colourful fabrics and bold designs.  The 1960s saw fashion reject the conventions and niceties of previous eras. Clothing broke with social traditions that dictated what could be worn when and by whom. In the past, attire had been divided in to 'formal' and 'casual' wear, and distinct separations were made between the styles of clothing worn by men and women. The 1960s, however, saw the emergence of unisex clothing such as denim jeans, which could be worn by both sexes.  1960s Mod fashion  Mod, short for 'modern', refers to a youth lifestyle that emerged from London during the 1960s, and quickly spread to America, Europe and Australia. Centred around London's thriving pop music, art and fashion scene, the mod lifestyle focused on innovation and the 'new'.  Mod fashion was slim fitting and featured bold geometric shapes. Colour was also a key concern - the conservative greys, browns and pastels of the 1950s were replaced by bright, wild hues. In contrast to fashion trends of the past, these garments were mass-produced and affordable.  Rising hemlines and the mini-skirt  The 1960s saw the appearance of the mini-skirt. Up until that time, skirts and dresses in Australia finished sensibly at the knee. New soaring hemlines created huge controversy when they first appeared, exposing centimetres of thigh never before seen in public.  At the Melbourne Cup in 1965, English model Jean Shrimpton created controversy by wearing a synthetic white shift dress with a hem high above her knees. She did not wear stockings, gloves or a hat. Shrimpton's outfit was considered scandalous, and made headlines around the world. By the end of the decade, however, shift dresses and mini-skirts had become widely accepted.  See Image 1  Mini-skirts represent more than just a fashion landmark of the decade - they have become an icon of the general culture of rebellion that characterised the 1960s. Young people were rejecting the social standards of the past and so too was their fashion. Many devotees of the feminist movement of the 1960s also saw the mini-skirt as a claim to the right of women to proudly display their bodies as they wished.  1960s Fashion icons  Throughout the 1960s, a number of famous people sported distinct fashion styles that were copied all over the world.  British teenage supermodel Leslie Hornby, also known as Twiggy due to her stick-thin figure, was a fashion idol to young girls everywhere. Her short, boyish haircut and leggy, waif-like frame graced the covers of every major fashion magazine.  While 1960s fashion was largely youth-driven, fashion icons also dictated the style of older women. Throughout her career, movie star Audrey Hepburn wore simple, flat shoes, three-quarter length pants, and plain black shift dresses. Her clothing style and her beehive hairdo, would be copied by millions of women worldwide.  See Image 2  Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of US President John F. Kennedy, became widely known for her beauty, grace and elegant style of dress. Her many public appearances popularised pearl necklaces, the pillbox hat (a small hat with a flat top and straight sides) and simple, big-buttoned suits.  1960s 'Hippie' fashion  Towards the end of the 1960s, the hippie movement had arrived in Australia. Many young people had become dissatisfied with the prevailing mainstream social values, considering them to be shallow and materialistic. Others strongly opposed Australian involvement | Question: What construction of nature inspired a 1960s women’s hairdo?", ['beehive'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1473')]

Her stolen medal was returned  LONDON, England\xa0\xa0\xa0 ●\xa0 London police say a bronze Olympic medal stolen from field hockey player Hannah Macleod has been returned.  Macleod’s medal, together with one earned by rower Alex Partridge, had been snatched Wednesday from the Mahiki nightclub, where the athletes went following a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in honor of Britain’s Olympic team.  Macleod and Partridge had publicly appealed for their return. Her medal was mailed anonymously to the England Hockey head office.  Police say the medal is being retained as part of its investigation but will be returned to the athlete shortly.  Police stressed Friday that the hunt is still on for Partridge’s medal and Macleod’s team jacket.  Police say a 31-year-old man had been arrested in the case and was later released on bail.  Rower Alex Partridge is still waiting for the return of his medal.  Earlier Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod had appealed for the return of their stolen Olympic bronze medals from London 2012.  Partridge said he was devastated when he realised his blazer, which had the medal in an inside pocket, had gone.  The 31-year-old told BBC Sport: “It’s very, very upsetting. It would mean everything to me to get them back.”  Partridge, whose bronze in the men’s eight followed a silver medal at the Beijing Games in 2008, added: “I worked for 12 years of my life to try to achieve something at the Olympic Games and that’s what I’ve got to show for it.  “While we were out and dancing away, I noticed I’d misplaced my blazer. In the morning, I thought one of the other Olympians must have picked it up by accident, but no-one had it.  “I always say to people ‘it’s not about the medal, it’s about the journey’, but I guess you don’t appreciate the value of it until it’s not there.  “It was only when I picked up my 16-month-old daughter from nursery that it really dawned on me. If it doesn’t come back she won’t see everything I worked for, which was a representation of being in the best British Olympic team and possibly the best Olympics ever.”  Macleod, who won her London 2012 bronze medal with the women’s hockey team, believes the theft was pre-meditated after viewing CCTV footage.  “It looked like a very well done job,” Macleod told BBC Radio 5 live.  “The CCTV footage shows a couple who were acting suspiciously and had done a couple of laps of the bar, scoping things out prior to approaching our group.”  \xa0  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news ...Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news | The Guardian  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post  Hannah Macleod's medal, taken from London nightclub while athletes partied, posted anonymously to England Hockey  London 2012 Olympic medalist Hannah MacLeod, whose bronze medal for hockey has been returned.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074'), ('Context: Hamilton Pool Preserve is a natural pool that was created when the dome of an underground river collapsed due to massive erosion thousands of years ago .

May 7th 2016  Nearly everyone has some kind of fear, and some fears are more common than others. Sometimes these fears are rooted in actual experiences and other times they are not. Even having multiple phobias is quite common. These are just some of the most common phobias, but there are much more that have been documented.  1. Arachnophobia  Arachnophobia is the fear of spiders. Many people who share this fear are typically affected by a childhood memory, or are just frightened by the appearance. Even the thought of one crawling on their skin can make them shudder in fear. In the dark ages, spiders were thought to harbor the bubonic plague and were seen as a source of food and water contamination, leading to a widespread fear of spiders.  2. Ophidiophobia  Ophidiophobia is a fear of snakes. Some experts believe that the fear of snakes may be an innate survival mechanism to protect people from poisonous reptiles, though others argue that if this was the case, this phobia wouldn\'t be as common as it is. This phobia can cause people to avoid places like zoos or pet stores.  3. Acrophobia  Acrophobia is a fear of heights. Unlike a lot of fears, this fear can manifest into other fears, such as a fear of flying or roller coasters. This fear can vary in severity as well. Some may avoid things like climbing ladders, while others may not be able to ride in an elevator or go to a high floor in a building.  4. Necrophobia  Necrophobia is the fear of death or dead things. This is a very common fear, especially after the loss of a loved one. This fear is a sort of defense mechanism of the mind. This can also be a very difficult phobia to overcome because of the uncertainty surrounding death and the large faith component associated with death and dying.  5. Cynophobia  Cynophobia is the fear of dogs, and is often the result of a traumatic experience. For example, someone bitten by a dog as an infant may have a fear of dogs into adulthood without knowing why. This phobia can cause people to avoid dog-owning friends or relatives.  6. Claustrophobia  Most people know that claustrophobia is the fear of confined spaces. This fear can manifest after a traumatic experience, such as being stuck in an elevator, though this is not always the case. Claustrophobia can vary in severity and is known to run in families.  7. Coulrophobia  Coulrophobia is the fear of clowns. Many people develop this fear as children, though this isn\'t always the case. Clowns are often portrayed in media as bad, such as in the move "It", or in real life as was the case with serial killer John Wayne Gacy who dressed up like a clown. This can trigger a phobia in some people.  8. Pediophobia  This is the phobia of dolls. Dolls were originally created as vessels for the dead, and this seems to be the root of many fears, particularly that the dolls could cause harm to the person with the phobia. One high profile case of pediophobia is that of Zak Bagans from the television show "Ghost Adventures." Bagans\' phobia is so intense that he cannon touch a doll or toy clown.  9. Hemophobia  This is the fear of blood. Some people experience feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness and occasionally faint at the sight of blood, even when it is something as small as a cut. The origins of this fear are unclear, but it may be related to a fear of death.  10. Glossaphobia  This is one phobia that many people struggle to overcome. Glossaphobia is the fear of public speaking. This phobia can manifest in childhood, and it\'s estimated that up to 75 percent of people have this fear to some degree.  11. Nyctophobia  This is one of the most common childhood fears, the fear of the darkness.

Furthermore , the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates , leaving them without political rights .

Steimetz et al. showed that the traditional morphological and regulatory markers such as actin , the ability to couple myosin side chains phosphorylation to higher concentrations of the positive concentrations of calcium , and other MyHC elements are present in all metazoans not just the organisms that have been shown to have muscle cells . Thus , the usage of any of these structural or regulatory elements in determining whether or not the muscle cells of the cnidarians and ctenophores are similar enough to the muscle cells of the bilaterians to confirm a single lineage is questionable according to Steinmetz et al. Furthermore , Steinmetz et al. explain that the orthologues of the MyHc genes that have been used to hypothesize the origin of striated muscle occurred through a gene duplication event that predates the first true muscle cells ( meaning striated muscle ) , and they show that the MyHc genes are present in the sponges that have contractile elements but no true muscle cells . Furthermore , Steinmetz et all showed that the localization of this duplicated set of genes that serve both the function of facilitating the formation of striated muscle genes and cell regulation and movement genes were already separated into striated myhc and non-muscle myhc . This separation of the duplicated set of genes is shown through the localization of the striated myhc to the contractile vacuole in sponges while the non-muscle myhc was more diffusely expressed during developmental cell shape and change . Steinmetz et al. found a similar pattern of localization in cnidarians with except with the cnidarian N. vectensis having this striated muscle marker present in the smooth muscle of the digestive track . Thus , Steinmetz et al. argue that the pleisiomorphic trait of the separated orthologues of myhc can not be used to determine the monophylogeny of muscle , and additionally argue that the presence of a striated muscle marker in the smooth muscle of this cnidarian shows a fundamentally different mechanism of muscle cell development and structure in cnidarians . | Question: what type of muscle is the digestive system ?', ['smooth'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-72409'), ('Context: The Battle of the Hydaspes was fought in 326 BC between Alexander the Great and King Porus of the Paurava kingdom on the banks of the river Jhelum ( known to the Greeks as Hydaspes ) in what is now the Punjab province of Pakistan .

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)

Location of Coney Island on a map.  Coney Island is a city found in New York , The United States Of America . It is located 40.58 latitude and -73.99 longitude and it is situated at elevation 2 meters above sea level.  Coney Island has a population of 60,000 making it the 23rd biggest city in New York. It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.  Things to Do and See in Coney Island  The Coney Island Museum  For less than a dollar, visitors can get to see artifacts that bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear Coney Island in this quaint museum.

The museum is open every Saturday and Sunday between 12 and 5 pm, right through the year, with opening hours sometimes extended during the summer months. The museum also serves as a tourist information center where visitors can use the bathrooms and receive knowledgeable answers to the questions about the area.

And there is more…  Iceland is one of the Nordic countries and part of Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden).  Reykjavík is the capital city of the Republic of Iceland.  Hvannadalshnukur (2,119m) is the highest point in Iceland.  Vatnajokull glacier in Southeast Iceland is Europe’s largest glacier.  Hekla is Iceland\'s most active volcano; Hekla is also a common female name in Iceland.  In 1963 a new volcano appeared in the Atlantic close to Iceland. It grew to become an island now called Surtsey.  The English word "geyser" comes from Iceland\'s Great Geysir in Haukadalur.  The phenomenon of the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) can be seen during mid-winter (November-December) when the weather is clear.  The "Althingi", the Icelandic parliament, dates back to the early tenth century.  The last name of Icelanders is derived from their father\'s first name.  In the telephone book everyone is listed by their first name.  In the last quarter of the nineteenth century twenty percent of Iceland\'s population emigrated to Canada and the USA.  In the 1960s and 70s there was a dispute between Iceland and the UK over fishing grounds, known as the "Cod Wars".  The population of Iceland reached 300,000 in the year 2006.  Soccer is Iceland’s favourite team game.  Icelandic, the language, belongs to the Germanic language family that includes German, Dutch and all the Nordic languages except Finnish. Its closest \'living relative\' is Faroese - both are derived from Old Norse.  Iceland, Not so quick (but still fun) facts!  Supernatural Iceland  Elves, trolls and ghosts  Surveys show that despite their obsession with modern technology, as many as 80% of Icelanders believe in the existence of elves. Even today, roads have been rerouted and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.  All around the country, strange lava formations were once explained in folktales as trolls who were turned to stone when caught outdoors in daylight. But only children in Iceland believe in trolls today, and the once widespread belief in ghosts is in decline, some say because electricity has taken the fright out of the long winter nights.  A different kind of fauna  Contrary to what many people think, there are no polar bears in Iceland. Admittedly, every ten years or so a polar bear may arrive as an accidental tourist on an ice flow from Greenland, However, they aren\'t invited to stay. The Arctic fox is the only native mammal. Reindeer live in the wild in east Iceland, but were only imported in the 18th century. Mink have also adapted to the wild, the descendants of animals which escaped from fur farms in the 1930s. A number of pedigree animal stocks are only found in Iceland. Many of these rare breeds have disappeared elsewhere and are the original decedents brought over by the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, cow, sheep and sheepdog. Marine mammals are also found in abundance along the coasts, especially minke whale, humpback whale, fin whale and several species of seals. Some whale watching tour operators claim 98% success rates for sightings.

The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype.

Presidents have entertained visiting heads of state, such a former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , conducted cabinet meetings, and briefed Congressional leaders at the retreat. The 1978 Middle East peace talks concluded with what have become known as the Camp David Accords. Yet few Americans know much about the place, considering its prominence.  Federal Summer Camp  It all started in 1935, when the Work Projects Administration , WPA, began building the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area Project near Thurmont, Maryland, as an example of creating parks from worn-out agricultural land.  Three years later, the area opened as a camp for federal government employees and their families. Known as Hi-Catoctin, the facility consisted of several small cabins, a dining hall, and a swimming pool. Covered with trees and 1,800 feet above sea level, the spot provided a cool respite from the near tropical humidity of the Washington, DC, area.  Meanwhile, immediately after America's entry into World War II, doctors for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt were urging the ailing president to find a place convenient to Washington, yet far enough away to escape the heat and political pressures of the city.  The presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was out of the question because of heightened security considerations imposed by the war. After a search committee considered two other sites on Furnace Mountain on the Virginia side of the Potomac River below Harper's Ferry; and Shenandoah National Park, Virginia; Roosevelt toured two sites in the Catoctin Mountains.  He picked Hi-Catoctin, issuing a set of instructions on how the buildings should be remodeled and asking for the construction of a main lodge, which resembled the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. The initial work cost $25,000. The camp was renamed the USS Shangri La, to follow up on the nautical connection, since many workers involved with the Potomac worked on the camp.  Popular Presidential Choice  Since Roosevelt inaugurated Shangri-La with a three-day visit beginning July 18, 1942, all subsequent presidents have made extensive use of the mountain top retreat.  President Harry Truman did not visit Shangri-La often because Bess, his wife, felt it was dull. However, when they did visit, the Trumans enjoyed Shangri-La. Truman's favorite sport was walking and he spent long hours wandering the mountain trails with a secret service agent in tow.  Renamed Camp David  President Dwight Eisenhower changed the name of the retreat to Camp David in honor of his grandson, David Eisenhower. Although he and his wife, Mamie, tended to use Camp David for private relaxation, Eisenhower held the first cabinet meeting ever to take place there. He also hosted British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David.  President John Kennedy and his family visited the camp often, enjoying the horseback riding and other recreational opportunities. Kennedy also allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use Camp David when he was not there.  President Lyndon Johnson held several important discussions with advisers on the Vietnam War, the crisis in the Dominican Republic, and other world events, at Camp David and hosted Prime Minister and Mrs. Harold Holt of Australia.  Reconstruction and Improvements  President Richard Nixon used Camp David as much as his five predecessors combined. Nixon had several new buildings built in compatible architectural styles, but complete with modern conveniences. He held cabinet meetings, staff conferences, hosted foreign dignitaries, and family get togethers at Camp David.  President Gerald Ford rode around Camp David on a snowmobile, and hosted President and Mrs. Suharto of Indonesia.  President Jimmy Carter hosted the now famous Camp David Summit in 1978, between Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and resulted in what are now known as the Camp David Accords establishing peace between Egypt and Israel.

Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal\'s USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.

Semenya won gold in the women\'s 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final. Semenya also won silver medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics, both in the 800 metres.  Following her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. She was withdrawn from international competition until 6 July 2010 when the IAAF cleared her to return to competition.  In 2010, the British magazine New Statesman included Semenya in a list of "50 People That Matter 2010".   Early life and education  Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in South Africa near Polokwane (back then called Pietersburg), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, "deep in South Africa\'s northern Limpopo province." She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a tomboy as a child.   Semenya attended Nthema Secondary School and now attends the University of Pretoria as a sports science student.   She began running as training for soccer.   Career  2008  In July Semenya participated in the 2008 World Junior Championships, and won the gold in the 800 m at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a time of 2:04.23.   2009  In the African Junior Championships Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.    With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone. The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date. It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by Zelda Pretorius at 1:58.85, and Zola Budd at 2:00.90, respectively.   The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it was "obliged to investigate" after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m\xa0– "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use."  The IAAF also asked Semenya to undergo a gender test after the win. News that the IAAF requested the test broke three hours before the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions."   In August Semenya won gold in the 800 metres at the World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final, again setting the fastest time of the year.   Gender test  Following her victory at the world championships, questions were raised about her gender.    The IAAF\'s handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticized the organization for its response to the incident.  Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as racist, as well as an affront to Semenya\'s privacy and human rights.   The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted."  The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a "rare medical condition" giving her an unfair competitive advantage. The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.  In an interview with South African magazine YOU Semenya stated, "God made me the way I am and I accept myself." She also took part in a makeover with the magazine.   On 7 September 2009, Wilfred Daniels, Semenya\'s coach with Athletics South Africa (ASA), resigned because he felt that ASA "did not advise Ms. Semenya properly".

It was celebrated in ancient Rome as the festival of Flora, the goddess of flowers, plants and fertility.  The festival had a licentious character which continued into the various pagan festivals that occurred across Europe.  Particularly, in Germany, these celebrations were Christianised to honour St. Walpurgia who brought Christianity to Germany.1 Some of the older traditional May Day celebrations included the crowning of a May Queen, dancing around a May pole and the gathering of spring flowers for decoration.  In France the symbol of May 1st is lily-of-the-valley (muguet).  This usage dates back to 1561, when King Charles IX, then aged 10, gave a sprig of this flower as a good luck charm to the ladies of his court.  The custom was revived around 1900 and today giving lily-of-the-valley to friends and family is a tradition.  The government allows these flowers to be sold tax-free, so it is a popular way for charities and other groups to raise money. The flowers must be gathered in the wild, not bought and then re-sold for this tax benefit to be allowed. The wild rose is a secondary symbol of May Day and may also be collected.  May 1st as Labour Day  May Day has another side to it.  It is also known as La fï¿½te du travail - Labour Day - and is a public holiday when all stores and even public transit may be closed. In France all workers except the most essential have an absolute right by law to not work on this day.3  This connection with the labour movement began in 1889 at a meeting of the Second International in Paris.  The Second International was an organization of socialist and labour parties.  Four workers had been shot and killed by police on May 4th, 1886 in Chicago while demonstrating for the eight-hour week.3 Known as the Haymarket Affair, it became a cause cï¿½lï¿½bre among labour movements, and along with other disturbances during a period of great social unrest, led to the declaring of May 1st as International Labour Day.  In 1936, wide-spread demonstrations on May 1st led to the formation of the first centre-left government in France which quickly introduced the 40-hour work week, two weeks paid holiday and the right to form a union.  Since then the day has been a consistent focus of labour activity and demonstrations. In France labour unions organize marches, demonstration and parades across the country on this day to re-enforce their commitment to improved rights for workers.  The Catholic Church has declared May 1st as Saint Joseph the Worker Day (Saint Joseph's feast day is on March 19th).5 In the May Day aspect, St. Joseph, the wife of Mary, is the patron Saint of Workers.  Mary herself is also strongly associated with May Day in the celebration of its Spring Festival aspect. The Pope always makes a speech on May Day in support of the rights of workers and the fair value of labour.  When is May Day?  May Day in France always falls on May 1st.  If it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is also observed on that Saturday or Sunday, and there wouldn't be a Bank Holiday that year.

The majority of designs incorporated the Union Flag and the Southern Cross , but native animals were also popular , including one that depicted a variety of indigenous animals playing cricket . The entries were put on display at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne and the judges took six days to deliberate before reaching their conclusion . Five almost identical entries were chosen as the winning design , and their designers shared the £ 200 ( 2015 : $29,142.12 ) prize money . They were Ivor Evans , a fourteen - year - old schoolboy from Melbourne ; Leslie John Hawkins , a teenager apprenticed to an optician from Sydney ; Egbert John Nuttall , an architect from Melbourne ; Annie Dorrington , an artist from Perth ; and William Stevens , a ship 's officer from Auckland , New Zealand . The five winners received £ 40 each .

Status: \xa0 False.  Origins: \xa0 As Santa Claus and his reindeer are to the secular celebration of Christmas, so the three wise men and the creche are to the religious celebration.  Even most of the non-religious (or non-Christian) among us recognize the symbolism of the nativity scene: it depicts the biblical account of three wise men from the east who rode atop camels and followed a star to Bethlehem, bearing gifts for the newborn Christ child who lay in a manger.  The truth is, the Bible contains virtually none of these details.  They have all been added over the years from sources outside the Bible.  Mathew 2:1 tells us:  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to  Jerusalem . . .  That\'s  it.  Matthew doesn\'t say how many wise men came from the east, doesn\'t mention their names, and doesn\'t provide any details about how they made their journey.  It has generally been assumed that the wise men (or magi) were three in number because Matthew 2:11 makes mention of three gifts:  ". . . they  presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh."  The number of wise men is not specified in the Bible, however, and some Eastern religions have claimed up to twelve of them made the journey to Bethlehem.   The names of the wise men, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, do not come from the Bible and did not appear in Christian literature until over five hundred years after the birth of Jesus.  Nothing in the Bible says the wise men rode camels (or any other animal); they may have made their journey from the east on foot for all we know.  And despite the familiar lyrics of the Christmas carol "We Three Kings," no biblical source depicts the three wise men as kings.  (They were most likely learned men, perhaps astrologers.)  However many wise men there were, and however they got to Bethlehem, the Bible tells us they arrived just after the birth and found the baby Jesus in a manger, right?  Not quite.  Matthew 2:11 states:  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped  him . . .  The wise men came "into the house," not the stable, and they saw a "young child," not a newborn.  This passage indicates that the wise men didn\'t arrive until quite some time after Jesus\' birth.  (According to  Luke 2,  it was shepherds, not wise men, who visited the infant Jesus in the manger.)  To sum up: we know from the Bible that wise men came from the east, that they followed a star to Bethlehem to find the Christ child, and that they brought him gold, and frankincense and myrrh.  We must look to sources external to the Bible to find the origins of any of the other familiar details, however.

She also really liked dudes.  In her 79 years of life, she had eight marriages with seven different men. Her mates included hotel heirs, construction workers, politicians and fellow actors. But they weren’t created equal.  So instead of revisiting Elizabeth Taylor’s many men in chronological order, we’ve ranked them by awesomeness and how their respective unions have stood the test of time. Let’s begin…  7. Michael Todd (1957-1958)  Poor Michael. Having fathered one of Liz’s four children should spare him from being in last place, but, alas, he’s the only husband of Taylor’s who exited the marriage by dying. Little more than a year after their 1957 wedding, his unfortunately-titled plane, “Lucky Liz,” crashed in New Mexico, killing him and three other passengers.  6. Michael Wilding (1952-1957)  A British actor who gave Liz her two sons, Michael and Christopher, Wilding seemed to exist solely in the shadow of his wife. His IMDB profile certainly pales in comparison.  5. Conrad\xa0 Hilton Jr. (1950-1951)  You never forget your first. Hilton may have marked Liz’s shortest marriage, but that makes him no less of a pioneer. Also? His dad was briefly a character on “Mad Men.”  4. John Warner (1976-1982)  One of just two Liz exes to survive her, Warner was the thinking man’s Mr. Taylor. He served in World War II, held the title of Secretary of the Navy and for the last three years of their marriage, he was a United States Senator — a title he held until his retirement in 2009.  3. Eddie Fisher (1959-1964)  You’ve got to hand it to Eddie just for guts he had in becoming husband #4 to Liz. Not only was the famous singer the best friend of newly-deceased Michael Todd, he left his wife Debbie Reynolds to marry her. Their union wasn’t what you would call “well-received.”  2.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

Louise Brough  1948-1950, 1955  No player has ever dominated Wimbledon more completely than did Brough in the three Championships between 1948 and 1950. Not only did she collect three of her four singles titles in that time, but she reached the final of every event, winning eight out of nine. The only final she lost was the mixed doubles in the middle year, when she played 117 games in three finals that involved five hours 20 minutes\' playing time on Centre Court on the final Saturday of the tournament. Her hard volleying was ideally suited to the Wimbledon grass courts, which she again demonstrated in adding a last singles victory in 1955. It was her 13th title in total at the All England Club and she did not drop a set in winning it. With Margaret du Pont, she also collected a remarkable 12 women\'s doubles successes in the US Championships.  Maria Bueno  1959-1960, 1964  The lithe and elegant Brazilian brought sex appeal to the Wimbledon lawns, improving the SW19 libido. All the men in the Centre Court crowd fell in love with Bueno after she won her first Wimbledon title in 1959, after which she was given a prize of a clothes voucher and then flown back in a presidential jet to a ticker-tape parade in Sao Paolo. In future years she titillated Wimbledon by wearing a white dress with a pink lining, and also won two more titles, in 1960 and 1964.  Maureen Connolly  1952-1954  Her first love was horse riding, but Maureen Connolly\'s mother could not afford the lessons and she turned to tennis. \'Little Mo\' snaffled a hat-trick of Wimbledon titles, from 1952-54, and was a popular figure back home in the United States. But that did not stop her from speaking of "the dark destiny" of her tennis career. "I always believed greatness on a tennis court was my destiny, a dark destiny at times, where the court became my secret jungle and I, a lonely, fear-stricken hunter. I was a strange little girl armed with hate, fear and a golden racket," Connolly once said.  Margaret Court  1963, 1965, 1970  \'Big Marge\' dominated the tour in the 1960s and 1970s, winning her first two Wimbledon titles, as Margaret Smith, in 1963 and 1965. She quit the circuit in 1966 to marry and start a family, but returned to the game as Margaret Court, and in 1970 won all four majors to achieve the grand slam. On the Wimbledon leg of that feat, Court and the American Billie Jean King contested what was one of the greatest finals in the tournament\'s history, with the Australian eventually closing out a 14-12, 11-9 victory. In addition to her three Wimbledon trophies, Court won a further 21 grand slam singles titles, taking her singles tally to 24, and many consider her to be the greatest female player to have ever stepped on Centre Court.
