The bridge provides access to Ford Island's historic sites to the public via tour bus and provides access to O'ahu for US military families housed on the island.  Before the completion of the bridge, the island's residents were required to use ferry boats operated by Naval personnel that operated on an hourly basis.  The bridge is one of only a few floating bridges and its floating moveable span is the largest worldwide.  Its namesake, Admiral Bernard A. Clarey, was one of the Navy's most decorated officers.

Ford Island  Ford Island (Hawaiian: ' ) is an islet in the center of Pearl Harbor, Oahu, in the U.S. state of Hawaii.  It has been known as Rabbit Island, Marín's Island, and Little Goats Island, and its native Hawaiian name is Mokuʻ umeʻ ume.  The island had an area of 334 acres when it was surveyed in 1825, which was increased during the 1930s to 441 acres with fill dredged out of Pearl Harbor by the United States Navy to accommodate battleships. | Question: What island in the center of Pearl Harbor is connected to the O'ahu by a floating bridge?

08/15/2021 15:48:17 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Cacareco  Cacareco (1954-1962) was a female black rhinoceros exhibited in Brazilian zoos.  She became famous as a candidate for the 1958 São Paulo city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption.  Electoral officials did not accept Cacareco's candidacy, but she eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that same election (which was also marked by rampant absenteeism).  Today, the term "voto Cacareco" (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil.  Cacareco's candidacy inspired the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, nominally led by the rhinoceros Cornelius the First.   Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–93)  The Rhinoceros Party (French: "Parti Rhinocéros") was a registered political party in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s.  Operating within the tradition of political satire, the Rhinoceros Party's basic credo, their so-called primal promise, was "a promise to keep none of our promises".  They then promised outlandishly impossible schemes designed to amuse and entertain the voting public. | Question: When did the party inspired by Cacareco begin in Canada?
