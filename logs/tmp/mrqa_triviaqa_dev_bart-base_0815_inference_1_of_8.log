There are six skin types , fair skin that always burn, dark skin that never burns and everything in between.  Melanin is the pigment that determines skin colour as well as hair and eye colour.  Melanin is produced by skin cells when they are exposed to the sun. The more sun exposure, the more melanin is produced .  There are two types of melanin , eumelanin which gives skin a brown colour (tan) and pheomelanin which gives skin a red colour (burn).  Regular sun exposure (e.g. every day) is associated with tanning. It increases eumelanin levels which gives skin a brownish tan and provides protection against the sun’s rays. This reduces the risk of burning and skin cancer with future sun exposure.  Irregular sun exposure (e.g. only during holidays or weekends) is associated with burning. It increases pheomelanin levels and increases cancer risk.  Exposure to artificial ultra-violet radiation from tanning beds has the same effect on skin colour and cancer risk as exposure to the sun’s ultra violet rays.  Skin Colour  Human skin comes in a wide variety of colours, ranging from shades of dark brown to almost white. Although an individual’s skin colour is influenced by numerous factors, the most significant is its content of a pigment called melanin. Melanin is also the pigment responsible for determining hair and eye colour.  Levels of melanin are primarily determined by genetics; individuals born to fair skinned parents will inherit their parent’s fair skin, as individuals born to dark skinned parents will inherit dark skin. The level of inherited skin pigmentation is referred to as constitutive pigmentation. A number of other factors determined at birth, for example the way a person’s body produces hormones and the way these hormones signal the cells which produce melanin, also influence skin colour. These factors inherited at birth, which cannot be changed, are referred to as intrinsic factors.  Extrinsic factors, things outside the body, also influence skin colour and provide acquired pigmentation. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the most important extrinsic factor. The sun emits UVA and UVB rays and the different types of UV rays have different effects on skin pigmentation. Exposure to UVA rays produces immediate pigmentation by influencing melanin which has already been produced and is waiting in the skin’s upper layers. Pigmentation which occurs several days after sun exposure is a result of new melanin being produced in response to UVB exposure. Other extrinsic factors which influence skin pigmentation and colour include DNA damage (often induced by UVB exposure) and age, as the way the body produces melanin changes as a person ages.  Skin type  Skin type is a classification based on the skin’s reaction to exposure to the sun’s UV radiation, after a period of non-exposure (e.g. sun exposure at the beginning of summer, when the skin has not been exposed during winter). The skin’s reaction is measured in terms of burning and tanning.  The Fitzpatrick system of classifying skin type is most commonly used in the assessment of skin cancer risk. The Fitzpatrick skin types are:  Type I     Melanin  Melanin is a pigment found in skin cells. There are two types of melanin which have visibly different effects on skin pigmentation. Eumelanin produces dark brown pigmentation and is the primary melanin type in individuals with darkly pigmented skin. Because eumelanin is insoluble, its skin-darkening (tanning) effects last a relatively long time, compared to the temporary skin-reddening effect of pheomelanin which is soluble. Pheomelanin is a red-yellow coloured pigment and the primary type of melanin in fair skinned individuals who are prone to sunburn. Eumelanin offers better protection from the sun’s UV rays compared to pheomelanin.  The melanin content of an individual’s skin is primarily determined by genetics meaning that babies inherit their skin colour from their parents. In particular a gene called plays a major role in determining an individual’s skin pigmentation. | Question: In the human body, which pigment is primarily responsible for the colour of skin?

Begun in the 1970s and ’80s and resuscitated at the turn of the 21st century, the Star Wars films continually advanced the field of motion picture special effects and developed into an enormously lucrative merchandising industry.  The sidekick “droids” R2-D2 and C-3PO from the original Star Wars trilogy …  Lucasfilm—20th Century Fox/The Kobal Collection  George Lucas’s success as a writer and director with American Graffiti (1973) gained him the backing of 20th Century Fox , which put up $9.5 million for the production of the first Star Wars film. The film, directed by Lucas, was in production for four years, with scenes shot in Tunisia and Death Valley , California, and on soundstages in England. When it was released on May 25, 1977, Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) met with runaway success. A space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the film centres on Luke Skywalker (played by the then relatively unknown Mark Hamill), a young man who finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an authoritarian empire and rebel forces. Skywalker and the opportunistic smuggler Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) are tasked with saving Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from captivity on a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth Vader , whose deep mechanically augmented voice (contributed by James Earl Jones ) became instantly iconic . At the core of the film and the series it initiated are the Jedi Knights—a group of either benevolent or malevolent warriors who harness and manipulate the Force, an all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of good and evil—and Skywalker’s quest to join their ranks.

The film won six Academy Awards along with a special-achievement award for accomplishments in sound, and it revolutionized the motion picture industry with its advancements in special effects . Lucas’s effects company, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), designed a slew of imaginative alien creatures and mechanical “droids” that populated a variety of exotic locales. Perhaps most impressive, however, were the elaborate space battles accomplished with scaled miniatures. The series continued to make remarkable advancements in the field of special effects into the 21st century, and ILM became one of the most successful effects studios utilized by Hollywood. Lucas followed the first Star Wars film with two sequels, Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi (1983). The franchise thrived in the 1980s and ’90s through the release of videos, a substantial merchandise line, and the theatrical re-release of the trilogy in 1997.

Get Known if you don't have an account  Share  WMG  Cinderella Man is an American film released in 2005, directed by Ron Howard , starring Russell Crowe , Renee Zellweger , Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko. It loosely follows the story of Real Life boxing champion James J. Braddock, aka "Cinderella Man" (played by Russell Crowe). It was an uplifting underdog story, set in a time when the country very much needed one.  The movie begins during what should have been the upswing of Braddock's career in the late 1920's. Braddock has it all — a successful boxing career, a pretty wife, Mae (played by Renee Zellweger), and 3 beautiful children. Cut to several years later, we find out that Braddock was forced to abandon his boxing career after suffering a broken hand. His wife saw this as a both a blessing and a curse, as she feared for his safety in the ring, but knew boxing was the best way for Jim to support their family.  As the Great Depression hits, Braddock is forced to do manual labor, working on the docks to (barely) support his family, who live in extremely poor conditions. At one point, he takes public assistance (a great source of shame to him) to pay his electricity bill, allowing his kids to stay in the house. After another boxer cancels at the last minute, Jim's old manager, Joe Gould (played by Paul Giamatti) asks him to fight the number two contender in the world. There is little chance Jim will win, but this is a Ron Howard film, so...  Jim wins the fight, thanks to new-found strength in his non-broken hand from his work on the docks, coupled with an uncompromising drive to support his family. After the stunning upset, Gould and Braddock discuss a full-time return to the ring. Mae is extremely angry with Joe for trying to profit from Jim's willingness to put himself in danger. She is surprised and humbled to see that Joe's belief in Jim is so strong, he and his wife have sold almost all of their possessions in order to pay for Jim's training.  As Jim continues to win fights, he moves closer to fighting the defending world champion, Max Baer (played by Craig Bierko), an arrogant and dangerous opponent in the ring. Jim's rags-to-riches story captivates the nation, earning him the nickname "Cinderella Man" and the fight is billed as a David vs. Goliath. Max Baer taunts Jim at every turn prior to the fight, attempting to humiliate him publicly. The boxing commissioner insists on showing footage of two of Baer's previous fights, where each boxer died from injuries sustained in the ring, so Jim is aware of what is at stake.  But Jim's resolve remains strong and he insists on fighting, because he feels a duty to all those who believe in him. On the night of the fight, Mae can not even bring herself to watch in person, or listen on the radio. In the end, of course, Braddock wins a stunning and hard-fought bout, enabling a Happily Ever After ending. But it is a Ron Howard movie, so this was to be expected.  Definitely not to be confused with Cinderella or the Eminem song of the same name.  This film provides examples of the following tropes:  Movie - Cinderella Man - James J BraddockCinderella Man Movie - Cinderella Man Trailer  On this day in 1933, Braddock fought Hans Birkie in a 10 round Loss  James J.
