In this period  Australia  was mainly occupied in sending forces to assist the European war and to strengthen  Singapore  and Malaya, our ï¿½forward defenceï¿½ against  Japan  .  However, a major part our activity involved the Empire Air Training Scheme, (EATS) under which various countries of the British Empire were trained as aircrew and sent to participate in the European war.  This involved the provision of a network of bases, which were mainly in the coastal area stretching from just north of  Brisbane  to Adelaide; a few were in south-west Western Australia.  The pace of the militarisation of  Australia  had been steadily increasing since 1934 [10] , but it was only with the realisation of the Japanese threat that a real sense of urgency developed. It was apparent that if a major Japanese attack developed while  Britain  was fully occupied in Europe there would be few British resources available to help  Australia  .  Australia  had inadequate infrastructure and relatively little industry, and enormous efforts were made to remedy these problems.  An unprecedented expansion of  ï¿½s air power was required. The formal proclamation of the  Bankstown  airfield project occurred under the National Security Act on 7 June 1940, The urgency was such work began immediately: the Act permitted construction to begin even before the land had been officially resumed by the government. [11] The estimated cost of acquisition of the land was ₤60,000. [12]  This speed of action was made possible by the enormous power granted to the director of munitions, Essington Lewis. He was exempt from the rules that regulated officers of the Crown, in particular the Public Service Act (1922). He was empowered to acquire compulsorily any materials or building which he needed; he could issue contracts with private firms without calling tenders; he could spend up to ï¿½250,000 on any project without prior approval and he could delegate and revoke responsibilities at will [13] .  The Allied Works Council and the Civil Construction Corps were the bodies that actually did the work. They had sweeping powers to commander any equipment needed, [14] hence the grader seen below was actually ï¿½borrowedï¿½ from  Bankstown  council.

Credit: ESA  This is part of a SPACE.com series of articles on the Greatest Moments in Flight, the breakthrough events that paved the way for human spaceflight and its next steps: asteroid mining and bases on the moon and Mars.  The United States and the Soviet Union vigorously competed to push the boundaries of mankind's exploration of space. The Russians scored a victory when they launched a small craft carrying cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin to new heights. His 108-minute flight gave him a permanent place in the history books as the first man in space.  The race to the stars  With the 1957 launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first manmade satellite, the Russians took an early lead in the space race. The next step was to send a human off the planet.  The American plan to send a man into space by 1961 created a deadline that the Russian team worked hard to beat. The development of the Vostok spacecraft became paramount. Prior to Gagarin’s historic flight, the Soviets sent a prototype of his spaceship, along with a life-size dummy called Ivan Ivanovich and a dog called Zvezdochka. With these successes, the vessel was considered ready to take a living, breathing human into space. [ INFOGRAPHIC: How the First Human Spaceflight Worked ]  The right stuff  More than 200 Russian Air Force fighter pilots were selected as cosmonaut candidates. Such pilots were considered optimum because they had exposure to the forces of acceleration and the ejection process, as well as experience with high-stress situations. Among the pilots was 27-year-old Senior Lieutenant Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin.  The third of four children, Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934, in a small village a hundred miles from Moscow. As a teenager, Gagarin witnessed a Russian Yak fighter plane make an emergency landing near his home. When offered a chance years later to join a flying club, he eagerly accepted, making his first solo flight in 1955. Only a few years later, he submitted his request to be considered as a cosmonaut. [ PHOTOS: Yuri Gagarin & 50 Years of Human Spaceflight ]  First in (space) flight  On April 12, 1961, at 9:07 a.m. Moscow time, the Vostok 1 spacecraft blasted off from the Soviets' launch site. Because no one was certain how weightlessness would affect a pilot, the spherical capsule had little in the way of onboard controls; the work was done either automatically or from the ground. If an emergency arose, Gagarin was supposed to receive an override code that would allow him to take manual control, but Sergei Korolov, chief designer of the Soviet space program, disregarded protocol and gave it to the pilot prior to the flight.  Over the course of 108 minutes, Vostok 1 traveled around the Earth once, reaching a maximum height of 203 miles (327 kilometers). Over Africa, the engines fired to bring Gagarin back to Earth. The craft carried ten days worth of provisions in case the engines failed and Gagarin was required to wait for the orbit to naturally decay, but they were unnecessary. Gagarin re-entered Earth's atmosphere, experiencing forces up to eight times the pull of gravity, but remained consciousness.  Vostok 1 had no engines to slow its re-entry or a way to land safely. About four miles up (seven kilometers), Gagarin ejected and parachuted to Earth. In order for the mission to be counted as an official spaceflight, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the governing body for aerospace records, had determined that the pilot must land with the spacecraft. Soviet leaders indicated that Gagarin had touched down with the Vostok 1, and did not reveal that he had ejected until 1971. Regardless, Gagarin still set the record as the | Question: What was the name of the first human spaceflight in which Yuri Gugarin was sent into space in April 1961?

08/15/2021 15:41:36 - INFO - __main__ - Context: MamuciumMamucium, also known as Mancunium, was a fort in the Roman province of Britannia.  The remains of the fort, protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, are in the Castlefield area of Manchester in North West England ().  Founded c. AD 79, Mamucium was garrisoned by a cohort of auxiliary soldiers and guarded the road running from Chester to York. A vicus, or civilian settlement made up of traders and the families of the soldiers, grew outside the fort and was an area of industrial activity.  The site lay in ruins until the Industrial Revolution when Manchester expanded and the fort was levelled to make way for new developments. It was damaged by the construction of the Rochdale Canal and the Great Northern Railway. The site is now part of the regenerated area of warehousing alongside the Rochdale Canal, part of the Castlefield Urban Heritage Park. Reconstructed remains of the fort's gatehouse, granaries, and some buildings from the vicus are on display to the public.  Location  When the Roman fort in Castlefield was built, it was on a naturally defensible sandstone bluff, guarding a nearby crossing over the River Medlock.Gregory (2007), p. 1. The fort was near a junction between at least two Roman roads. It guarded the road between the legionary fortresses of Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) running east to west, as well as the road between Manchester and Bremetennacum (Ribchester) to the north.  In addition, Mamucium may also have overlooked a lesser road running north west to Coccium (Wigan).Gregory (2007), p. 2. The fort was one of a chain of fortifications along the Eboracum to Deva Victrix road, with Castleshaw Roman fort lying 16 mi to the east,  and Condate (Northwich)  to the west. Stamps on tegulae indicate that Mamucium had administrative links not only with Castleshaw, but also with Ardotalia, the nearest fort (12 miles), Slack and Ebchester; all the forts probably got the tegulae from the same place in Grimescar Wood near Huddersfield.   The area around the fort changed greatly in the centuries that followed; the remains are now surrounded by mills built during Industrial Revolution and were further damaged by the subsequent urbanisation of Manchester.  Castlefield is at the south west corner of Manchester city centre and the Rochdale Canal cuts through the southern corner of the fort. Deansgate, which has developed into a busy thoroughfare, passes close to the east of the fort and follows the general line of Roman road to Ribchester and Castlefield.  Name  The name Mamucium is generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brittonic name, either from mamm- ("breast", in reference to a "breast-like hill")   or from mamma ("mother", in reference to a local river goddess). Both meanings are preserved in languages derived from Common Brittonic, mam meaning "breast" in Irish and "mother" in Welsh.   The neuter suffix -ium is used in Latin placenames, particularly those representing Common Brittonic -ion (a genitive suffix denoting "place or city of ~"). The Welsh name for Manchester is ' and presumably derives from the original Brittonic form.  History  Prehistoric  Although there is no evidence of prehistoric settlement, there is evidence of activity in the area. A Neolithic scraper, two Mesolithic flints and a flint flake have been discovered, as well as a shard of late Bronze Age pottery; however these were mostly not found in situ.  Although the area was in the territory of the Celtic tribe Brigantes until the Romans annexed the area, it may have been under the control of the Setantii, a sub-tribe of the Brigantes.   Roman  The fort was built around  79;  it was built as part of the fortifications erected under Gn. Julius Agricola during his campaigns against the Brigantes after the treaty with them failed.  Excavations have demonstrated that the fort had three main phases of construction: one around  79, the second around 160 AD, and the third around 200. The first phase of the fort was built from turf and timber. Mamucium | Question: Mamucium was the Roman name for which English city?
