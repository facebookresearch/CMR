08/15/2021 15:41:37 - INFO - __main__ - Context: BesomBesom is a dialectal or historical word for what is now known as a broom, a household implement used for sweeping.   The term "besom" is now mostly reserved for a "traditionally constructed" broom, made from a bundle of twigs tied to  a stouter pole.   The twigs used could be broom (i.e. Genista, whence the modern name "broom" for the tool), heather or similar.  The song "Buy Broom Buzzems" from Northern England refers to both types of twig.  From the phrase broom besom the more common broom comes.  Description  As a result of its construction around a central pole, the brush of the besom is rounded instead of flat. The bristles can be made of many materials including, but not limited to straw, herbs, or twigs. Traditionally the handle is of hazel wood and the head is of birch twigs. Modern construction uses bindings of wire and string (instead of the traditional split withy) and the head is secured by a steel nail instead of a wooden dowel.  In Wicca  A besom is a tool used in Wicca to cleanse and purify a space which will be used for ritual. A traditional Wiccan besom is a hawthorn stave handle with bristles made from birch twigs. These twigs are tied on using thin pieces of willow wood. It is used to cleanse the ritual area before circle casting. While it does not usually touch the ground, it is used to "sweep out" the negative energies in a room, and is often held a few inches above the ground to do so. As a tool, the besom is usually thought of as masculine in nature due to its phallic shape and symbolism. However the besom's components are of both masculine and feminine orientation.   The handle, an ash stave, is masculine in nature while the birch used for the bristles is thought of as feminine in nature.  The besom is thought to be involved with fairies.  The besom is an important part of Wiccan handfasting ceremonies in some traditions. The couple jump over the besom during the ceremony. Alternatively, the couple may jump over a small bonfire.  Other meanings  In Scotland, "besom" (pronounced "bih-zum") may be used to refer to a particularly annoying person or naughty child.  The Witch’s Besom – The Modern PaganThe Witch’s Besom – The Modern Pagan   •  4 Comments  By Lyon Mercaeant  Samhain is right around the corner and along with that of course, is also the secular Halloween.  One of the most popular icons of the holiday is the old witchy hag, with her warty nose, trendy buckled boots (Hey – if you hold onto anything long enough it will come back into style again!), and what item is this green skinned diva never seen without?  Her broom, or more accurately termed, her besom.  Regardless of the fictional portrayal of witches in the mainstream seasonal iconography, the besom is actually a tool used within the modern practice of witchcraft, and it is an item that is fun but also steeped in quite a bit of symbolic lore and tradition.  I am going to explore some of this symbolism, as well as discuss its uses and ideas for their creation.  I will also leave you with some resources for learning how to create your very own besoms.  The besom, while being a standard in housekeeping practices since ages long past, is actually quite more than just domestic armament.  Magically speaking, it is a symbol of fertility and sexuality.  Many sources cite the traditional construction of besoms as having a handle made of ash, a head made of birch twigs, with bindings made of willow.  The ash according to Scott Cunningham is a wood associated with masculinity, fire and amorous love.  The birch is a wood associated with femininity, protection and cleansing.  The besom takes the two and becomes a symbol of their uniting as one.  You can make the implied leaps in imagery required here I’m sure.  This is one of the reasons why the besom is traditionally | Question: What is a besom used to do?

A:  Quick Answer  An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. An icosahedron has 30 edges and 12 vertices. Five equilateral triangles meet at each vertex.  Full Answer  An icosahedron is an example of a Platonic solid, which is a polyhedron that is regular, convex, made of congruent faces of regular polygons, and has the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. Only five known shapes meet this criteria.  The other Platonic solids include the tetrahedron with four triangular faces, the cube, or hexahedron, with six square faces, the octahedron with eight triangular faces and the dodecahedron with twelve pentagonal faces.  Solid shapes and their nets - icosahedronSolid shapes and their nets - icosahedron  Icosahedron  Other regular solids with triangular faces?  Description of an icosahedron  A tetrahedron is made of triangles with three triangles at each point. An octahedron has four triangles at each point. Can we fit five triangles at each point? Yes, we can, and it's called an icosahedron. It has 20 faces.  There are 43380 distinct nets for the icosahedron, so I don't expect you to find them all! An icosahedron can be thought of as ten triangles going round the 'equator', with five at the 'north pole' and five at the 'south pole'. Thinking of this helps us to work out a net.  Model of an icosahedron  This model (right) was made from a kit with magnetic connections. Since it just shows the edges, you can see through the model, which means that you can count the vertices and edges easier. Unfortunately, since the icosahedron is quite complicated, one edge and one vertex(corner) is hidden, several more are hard to make out, and the shadows don't help! Still, you can guess, or perhaps you can make up your own model to count from. How many vertices (corners) and edges are there? See Euler's formula .  Net of an icosahedron  Here is one net for an icosahedron. Print it out, stick it on thin card, score along the lines and fold them, form the shape, then stick it together with small amounts of glue.  For more details, see the notes for the net of a cube .  Colour scheme for model  You might like to think of a colour scheme for your finished shape. It's a lot easier if you colour it in before you stick it together, or even before you cut it out. Try to imagine what the finished shape will look like when colouring it in. You could try to draw lines that run over edges. That's easy if the faces are together in the net, less easy if there are gaps! Do you want straight lines or curvy ones? Can you draw a line which will end up going right round the shape? How about colouring all the bits near a point in the same colour? You could paint the 'equator' one colour, and the two 'poles' another. There are diamonds on the finished surface - try finding them and painting them. An icosahedron is fairly close to a sphere, so if you are really ambitious, you could try drawing the world on it.  Then when you stick it together, you can see if your shape's design looks anything like you imagined it would!  Viruses  Many viruses have the shape of an icosahedron. This is a common cold virus, with the icosahedron drawn on.

08/15/2021 15:41:37 - INFO - __main__ - Context: THE YOUNGEST MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS - 1973THE YOUNGEST MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS - 1973  THE YOUNGEST MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS - 1973  By L. Robert Davids  The public accent on youth in recent years has had little effect upon major league baseball.  Clubs have been restricted from signing young stars until they are out of high school, and this reduces the ranks of fuzzy-faced youngsters on Big League rosters.  The youngest player in 1972, for example, was Rowland Office, outfielder for Atlanta, who played in two games about 2-1/2 months before his 20th birthday on October 25.  This is enough to make Joe Nuxhall turn cartwheels in his broadcast booth.  Nuxhall, you may recall, was only 15 when he made his debut with the Reds in 1944.  The contribution of teenagers to major league baseball has been somewhat limited over the years, although there have been more than 25 who made their playing debuts at 17, and about a half-dozen who broke in at 16.  That doesn’t mean that they really took hold at that age, however.  The question comes up, for example, was there a hurler who won 20 games in a season prior to his 20th birthday?  We have a recent example of Wally Bunker winning 19 for Baltimore in 1964 when he was 19.  And bob Feller won 17 for the Indians in 1939 when he was 19.  However, it looks like long-forgotten Jake Weimer was the only one to do it in this century.  He won 21 for the Cubs in 1903 when he was 19, and then to prove it was no fluke, he won 20 the next year.  But he seemed to be going down hill, as he faded to 18 in 1905.  Going back before 1900, there were a number of outstanding young hurlers who carried a man-sized load prior to their 20th birthday.  Hard-throwing Amos Rusie made his debut with Indianapolis of the NL in 1889 when he was still 17, and the next year when he was 18-19 years old, he won 29 games for the Giants.  Hall of Famer Monte Ward started off big in 1878 with Providence when he won 22 games as an 18-year-old.  The next year he pitched Providence to the pennant with 47 victories, and by the time he celebrated his 21st birthday, he had won 107 major league games.  Of course, his arm was then about shot and he soon had to shift to the infield.  The youngest of the young hurlers in the 19th century was probably Wee Willie McGill, a gifted lefthander picked off the Chicago sandlots by Cleveland of the Players League in 1890.  Although his precise age was not publicized at the time, he was only 16 years and six months when he started a game against Buffalo at Cleveland on May 8.  He was not only very young, but very short, about 5-1/2 feet tall, and his prospects did not look very good.  But, this is what the writer of the Buffalo Express had to say:  “A young man named McGill, a regular Davy Force sort of ballplayers (very short), was in the box for Cleveland.  He is like the little girl’s definition of a sugar plumb, round and rosy and sweet all over, and he throws barrel hoops and corkscrews at the plate.  Once in a while he varies these with a swift, straight ball that is as full of starch as though it had just come from the laundry.”  McGill, backed by such Cleveland stars as Ed Delahanty and Pete Browning, defeated Buffalo 14-5 in a complete game victory.  He gave up 7 hits and 7 walks, but fanned 10.  He had little trouble with the Buffalo Squad, which included such stars ad Dummy Hoy, Connie Mack, and Deacon White, who, at 42, was the oldest player then active in the majors.  McGill collected a single himself, and knocked in a run.  The young hurler, called Kid or Baby, did not travel with the Brotherhood team | Question: Who was the youngest player to appear in a major league game in the modern era, pitching 2/3 of an inning for the Cincinnati Reds against the St. Louis Cardinals in 1944 when not quite 16 years old?
