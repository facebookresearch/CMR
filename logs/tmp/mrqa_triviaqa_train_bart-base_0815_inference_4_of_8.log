IN THESE GROUPS  Rags to Riches  Mark Wahlberg - Mini Biography (TV-PG; 3:10) Actor Mark Wahlberg first gained recognition as the frontman for Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and as a model for Calvin Klein. His long list of acting credits includes the films "The Departed," and "Boogie Nights."  Synopsis  Born on June 5, 1971, in Dorchester, Mass., Mark Wahlberg grew up the youngest of nine children. After a 45-day jail term at 16, Wahlberg turned his life around via the music world with the help of his brother Donnie, a member of New Kids on the Block. Wahlberg transformed from rapper to Hollywood actor and never looked back, starring in films such as Boogie Nights and Three Kings. His recent projects include Lone Survivor (2013), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) and Ted 2 (2015).  On the Streets of Boston  Actor and former rapper Mark Wahlberg was born on June 5, 1971, in Dorchester,  Massachusetts. Wahlberg grew up the youngest of nine children in a  working class Irish Catholic family in the Boston district of  Dorchester. Wahlberg's parents divorced when he was 11; his mother  has since blamed her own emotional neglect for her youngest son's  descent into juvenile delinquency during the next several years.  At 14,  Wahlberg dropped out of school and began making his living on the  streets—hustling, stealing, and selling drugs. Two years later, he  hit rock bottom when he was jailed for his role in the savage beating of  a Vietnamese man. Although the crime was believed by many to be  racially motivated, Wahlberg has continually denied that race played a  part in the attack. His 45-day stint in prison was a self-proclaimed  turning point in the 16-year-old Wahlberg's life. Vowing to give himself  some direction in his life, he also began body building seriously,  chiseling his body into impressive form.  Pop Star Fame  By the time  Wahlberg had emerged from prison, his older brother Donnie had rocketed to  stardom as one of five fresh-faced members of the pop band New Kids on  the Block. Donnie decided to help his younger brother find his own niche  in the music business. What Wahlberg lacked in singing ability, he made  up for in charisma and good looks—with Donnie's hip-hop arrangements  and producing help, Marky Mark (his rap name) and his back-up deejay  and dancers (dubbed "the Funky Bunch") recorded a debut album, Music for  the People (1991). Driven by the success of the hit dance singles "Good  Vibrations" and "Wildside" (and by Marky Mark's readiness to discard  his shirt and drop his pants onstage and in his videos), the album went  platinum, selling over a million copies.  One of pop  music's hottest new commodities, Wahlberg (and his rock-hard physique)  became even more ubiquitous when he signed a two-year contract with the  designer Calvin Klein to model underwear. His raucous public persona, he  once became involved in a much-talked-about brawl with Madonna and her  entourage at a Los Angeles nightclub only served to increase his popular  appeal, until news began surfacing about his criminal past and his  possibly racist and homophobic tendencies.  In 1993, this  part of Wahlberg's personal life was seriously questioned when he was  accused of condoning blatantly homophobic remarks made on a British talk  show by his fellow guest, the reggae singer Shabba Ranks. Combined with  the disappointing sales of the Funky Bunch's second album, You Gotta  Believe (1992), the public criticism of Wahlberg's career seemed to be  steering his career towards certain | Question: What is Mark Wahlberg's home town?

08/15/2021 15:41:37 - INFO - __main__ - Context: She-RaShe-Ra is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Filmation cartoon She-Ra: Princess of Power, debuting in 1985.  Also, a series of toys under her name were produced by Mattel.  She is the alter ego of Princess Adora and the twin sister of Prince Adam/He-Man.  She-Ra was intended to appeal to young girls in the same way that He-Man appealed to young boys.   Filmation writer Larry DiTillio created the backstory for the property.   She-Ra is introduced in the animated movie The Secret of the Sword as Force Captain Adora, a member of the Evil Horde that rules the planet Etheria. Princess Adora discovers that she is the long lost twin sister of Prince Adam of Eternia, having been kidnapped as a baby by the Horde's leader Hordak. She is granted the Sword of Protection, which parallels He-Man's Sword of Power, gaining the power to transform into She-Ra, her secret identity.   Fictional character biography  King Randor and Queen Marlena from planet Eternia, had twins, a girl and a boy named Adora and Adam. Hordak, leader of the Evil Horde, kidnapped Adora and escaped to Etheria, where Adora was raised as a mind-controlled Force Captain of The Horde.  Adora's uniform – which she continued to wear throughout the series, even after defecting to the Rebels – consisted of a red tunic over a white long sleeved shirt, matching red boots and gauntlets, and a pair of red shorts with a black belt.   The Sorceress sent Adam and Cringer to the planet Etheria to give the sword the Sorceress gave him to Adora.  The Sorceress reveals to Adora that she was kidnapped by The Horde when she was a baby and that she had a twin brother. By repeating "For the honor of Grayskull" she is transformed into the heroine; She-Ra. She releases He-Man and jumps from a window, crashing into the Horde stables, landing atop Spirit who is transformed into Swift Wind, a winged talking unicorn.  They fly ahead to warn The Rebellion.  He-Man and She-Ra return to Eternia, but she decides she must return to Etheria so that she can help free the planet from the Horde oppression.   Adora, having been trained by the Horde her entire life, assumes leadership of the Great Rebellion. The epic battle to free Etheria from the grip of the Evil Horde rages on, spreading across the corners of the planet. Through this war, She-Ra calls upon her allies across the globe, using their special talents to battle against Horde creations.  Whether or not She-Ra and her forces were ever successful in defeating the Horde was never revealed. Unlike Adam, who often feigned laziness and a carefree attitude to deflect any suspicion that he may be He-Man, Adora never acted against her nature and was always seen as brave and selfless, willing to help others in need at a moment's notice.   When Adora transforms to She-Ra, two castles are shown in the background.  The first is Castle Grayskull.  The second is the Crystal Castle.  The Crystal Castle is located at the top of Skydancer Mountain and is overseen by an entity called Light Hope, who advises She-Ra in times of crisis.  In the Princess of Power toyline, the castle is also protected by two winged crystal horses, Moonbeam and Sun Dancer. It should be noted that the Crystal Castle's location is known only to Ahgo (King of the Trolls), She-Ra, and He-Man (she brought him there one time); She-Ra has sworn to secrecy its location, thus earning the title of "Defender of the Crystal Castle."  Powers and abilities  She-Ra is known for her incredible strength. Many times she has been shown to be able to lift not only full-grown men and robots, but also mountain-like rocks and buildings. She is also depicted as being extremely fast and acrobatic.  Her speed | Question: Who is He-Man's twin sister?
