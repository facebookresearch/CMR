06/24/2021 11:10:34 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Hold On to the Nights"Hold On to the Nights" is a power ballad and number-one hit for American rock singer/songwriter/musician Richard Marx.

Written by Richard Marx, "Hold On to the Nights" reached the Billboard Hot 100 number 1 position on July 23, 1988, preventing Def Leppard's "Pour Some Sugar On Me" from reaching the top spot that same week. The song was on the chart for twenty-one weeks, and left the chart at number 65. From Marx' debut 1987 album, Richard Marx, the song also reached number three on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

06/24/2021 11:10:34 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Nikkei Definition | InvestopediaNikkei Definition | Investopedia  Nikkei  What is the 'Nikkei'  Nikkei is short for Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average, the leading and most-respected index of Japanese stocks. It is a price-weighted index comprised of Japan's top 225 blue-chip companies traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange . The Nikkei is equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the United States.  BREAKING DOWN 'Nikkei'  Originally called the Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average (from 1975 to 1985), it is now named for the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" or Japan Economic Newspaper, commonly known as Nikkei, which sponsors the calculation of the index. The index has been calculated since September 1950, retroactive to May 1949. Among the best-known companies included in the Nikkei index are Canon Inc., Sony Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation. It is the oldest stock index in Asia.  The Nikkei was established as part of the rebuilding and industrialization of Japan in the aftermath of the Second World War. Constituent stocks are ranked by share price, rather than by market capitalization as is common in most indexes. Valuations are denominated in Japanese yen. The composition of the Nikkei is reviewed every September, and any needed changes take place in October.  Background  The Tokyo Stock Exchange was established in 1878. In 1943, during the Second World War, the Japanese government combined the TSE with five others to form a single Japanese Stock Exchange. That exchange was closed down in August 1945, near the end of the war. The Tokyo Stock Exchange re-opened on May 16, 1949 under the aegis of the new Securities Exchange Act .  Japan experienced a major asset bubble in the late 1980's, as the government used fiscal and monetary stimuli to counteract a recession caused by the Japanese yen's 50% appreciation during the first part of the decade. Stock prices and land values tripled between 1985 and 1989; at the height of the bubble, the TSE accounted for 60% of global stock market capitalization. The bubble burst in 1990, and the value of the Nikkei Index fell by one-third that year. In October 2008, the Nikkei traded below 7,000; this was a decline of more than 80% from its December 1989 high. It subsequently rebounded strongly, rising 150% between June 2012 and June 2015 with the help of economic stimulus from the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan . This was still nearly 50% below the 1989 high.  Investing in the Nikkei Index  It is not possible to directly purchase an index, but there are several Exchange Traded Funds whose components correlate to the Nikkei. ETFs that track it and trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange include Blackrock Japan's iShares Nikkei 225 and Nomura Asset Management 's Nikkei 225 Exchange Traded Fund. The MAXIS Nikkei 225 Index ETF is a dollar-denominated fund that trades on the New York Stock Exchange .  Trading Center | Question: What is the Japanese share index called?

06/24/2021 11:10:34 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Kiss You All Over"Kiss You All Over" is a 1978 song performed by the group Exile. It was written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn. It was included on the band's album Mixed Emotions, and it featured Jimmy Stokley and guitarist JP Pennington on lead vocals. It was a number one single in the United States, but proved to be Exile's only big hit in the pop rock market.  Billboard ranked it as the No. 5 song for 1978. In the United Kingdom, the song was released on Mickie Most's RAK Records, and it peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.  In this song, a string synthesizer is used.  Lead vocalist on the song Stokley was ousted from the band in 1979, his health declining thereafter until he died at the age of 41 in 1985. The band moved into country music following the synth-pop success of "Kiss You All Over" and the 1979 follow-on hit "You Thrill Me" (reaching #40 (UK no. 67)) and "How Could This Go Wrong", #88 on the charts. "Take Me Down" peaked at #3 on the Euro Hit 40 in the mid-1980s.  Cover versions  * 1978: A version by Jim Mundy and Terri Melton made number 87 on the Hot Country Songs charts.  * 1978: A Disco version was covered by Broadway  * 1979: Along with the track "So Strange", Phyllis Hyman covered this song and had a minor disco hit, peaking at number 75.  * Also in 1979, Millie Jackson covered this song for her album A Moment's Pleasure and it was released as a single in Europe.  * 1982: A lovers rock version by Samantha Rose produced by reggae producer Winston Curtis was recorded in London.  * 1993: Tiffany released a version on her Asia-only album Dreams Never Die. The album (and song) were re-released in the U.S. in 2005.   * 1997: The band No Mercy's remixed version by Johnny Vicious and Darrin "Spike" Friedman reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.  It also reached #16 on the UK Singles Chart and #47 in Australia.  * 2013: On the album Love Will..., Trace Adkins recorded a cover version with Exile (J.P. Pennington and Les Taylor).  * 2016: A cover of the song appears on the Information Society album Orders of Magnitude  Appearances in other media  The song was featured in the films Happy Gilmore, Wild Hogs, Man on the Moon, Employee of the Month, and Zookeeper. It was also used in 2007 on CBC's Hockey Night In Canada during a montage of Stanley Cup celebrations at the conclusion of the final game of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The song closes out the finale of the first season of the Amazon Series Red Oaks.
