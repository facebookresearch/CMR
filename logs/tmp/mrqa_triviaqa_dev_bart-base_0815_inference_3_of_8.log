After all, men can't wear dresses, but we can wear the pants.”  “You can fool people. You can fool anybody anytime of the day, but you can't fool yourself. At night, when you go home, you've got to be straight up with you.”  “I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow; if I fail, or if I succeed at least I did as I believe.”  “When I decided to be a singer, my mother warned me I'd be alone a lot. Basically we all are. Loneliness comes with life.”  Bio:  Whitney Houston (born Whitney Elizabeth Houston, in Newark, New Jersey, on August 9, 1963) was an American singer, actress, producer and model. Whitney is one of the top female performers of all time and one of pop music’s best-selling artists. Her ability to appeal to a wide audience and cover multiple genres led her to immense success and many awards, paving the way for future women R&B recording artists. Whitney released six studio albums, one holiday album and three movie soundtrack albums, all having diamond, platinum or gold certification. Starting her career as a featured vocalist for New York-based funk band Material, Whitney was quickly recognized by major record labels, leading to her debut solo album, Whitney Houston in 1985. Whitney starred in the 1992 film The Bodyguard, and the soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, which included Whitney’s lead single, “I Will Always Love You.” Whitney tragically died on February 9, 2012 in Beverly Hills, Calif., after drowning in a bathtub from cocaine use and heart disease. The singer’s legend lives on, and in 2015, a biopic called Whitney was made, chronicling her eventful life.  Best Known For:  Whitney is an iconic singer, known for producing smash hits like her cover of Dolly Parton‘s “I Will Always Love You.”  Personal Life:  Whitney was married to R&B singer Bobby Brown from 1992-2007. Together, they had Whitney’s only child, Bobbi Kristina Brown in March 1993. Whitney’s drug use became apparent in 1996 and the singer was admitted to rehab twice.

More News  Paramedics arriving at the Beverly Hilton found the singer's body.    While the cause of death is still unknown, Houston's publicist Kristen Foster has confirmed the sad news.   Houston had been scheduled to attend the annual pre-Grammy party of music mogul Clive Davis, who discovered her, tonight and had attended rehearsals for the event earlier this week. The party was still held, and Davis asked for a moment of silence as they dedicated the evening to Houston.  Recording Academy president Neil Portnow said at the pre-Grammy gala that Sunday's Grammy ceremony would include "something appropriate" in tribute to the singer, including a performance by Jennifer Hudson. "What's beautiful about Whitney is the legacy she left."  "Whitney always hit you with that beautiful smile, that incredible energy" said Diddy, who also attended Davis' pre-Grammy gathering. "Whitney Houston had the greatest voice in the world. We truly lost an angel." | Question: Who was married to Whitney Houston from 1992 to 2007?

Please click on the links to view our new policies. Thanks!  Horse Hoof Anatomy Inside and Out  What Every Horseman Needs to Know  It all starts with horse hoof anatomy. As the saying goes, “No hoof, no horse.” When you understand the anatomy of a hoof you can take better care of it and greatly increase the longevity and usefulness of your horse.  Equine Hoof Anatomy – The Outer Structure  The hoof wall is made up of horny tissue.  The hoof continues to grow throughout the life of the horse, much like fingernails in humans. Just like fingernails, the horny shell has no nerves or blood vessels. The horny hoof wall grows out from the coronary band that sits just at the hair line above the hoof.  The hoof itself is thick and hard, yet pliable. The hoof wall is thickest at the toe and thinner at the heel. The ideal horse hoof anatomy should have a nice rounded toe and a wide heel base. A narrow heel suggests the presence of navicular disease or the tendency toward contracting navicular.  The hoof will soften in wet conditions and dry out in dry conditions. Adding a bit of vegetable oil to your horse’s diet will help keep the hooves strong and moisturized from the inside out. Just like human nails and hair, the horses hoof and coat will respond to oils in the diet.  Horse Hoof Anatomy – The Bottom Side  Looking at the illustration you can clearly see the structure of the bottom of the hoof. The most pronounced feature is the triangular shaped frog. The frog acts as a shock absorber. It is the softest part of the horses hoof and expands with each step, as does the flexible heel of the hoof. Horse shoes should be slightly wider than the heel of the hoof to allow for this expansion.  Did you know the frog sheds twice a year?  The white line is the transitional tissue between the tough horny outer wall of the hoof, and the sensitive inner tissues of the hoof. When a farrier is shoeing a horse, he places the nails into the horny wall that has no nerve or blood vessels. A white line that is pierced by a farriers nail causes pain, lameness and possible infection.  The bars of the hoof serve in several ways. They help to take up some of the weight that is placed on the hoof wall and they keep the hoof from over and under expanding. The bars also spread out slightly with each step to help drive the ‘heart pump’ action of the hoof.  Horse Hoof Anatomy – The Inner Structure  The coffin bone is the ‘toe’ bone of the horse’s foot. This bone is shaped like a small hoof with flared sides. This is the bone that rotates downward to pierce the sole of the foot in a horse with founder. The coffin bone meets the short pastern bone while the tiny navicular bone just behind them both inside the horses hoof.  The Horse Hoof - The Second Heart  Did you know that a horse has no muscles in their lower leg? The lower leg is made up of bone, ligament and tendons, and of course the all important hoof. The horse hoof anatomy allows the hoof to act as a second heart. With each step the horse takes, the flexible hoof expands and contracts, forcing blood back up the horses leg toward the heart.   This is why keeping a horse in a stall with little activity is so unhealthy. The lack of exercise and movement cuts down on circulation. This can cause a horse to “stock up”,  a condition where the lower legs are swollen from lack of circulation.  The sole of the hoof is harder than the frog and softer than the outer hoof wall. It is flexible and acts at the ‘heart pump’. The sole in the front hoof is round shaped, while the sole of the back hoof is more oval shaped. A concave sole is preferable to a flat sole.
