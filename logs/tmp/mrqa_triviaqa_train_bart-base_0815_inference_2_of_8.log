It's... Springfield.  "Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon," Groening revealed in an interview with Smithsonian.com.  "The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show Father Knows Best took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown," he told the magazine.  "When I grew up, I realised it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the US. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, “This will be cool; everyone will think it’s their Springfield.” And they do."  There are more than 500 episodes of The Simpsons, and the show is the longest-running sitcom on American television. But Groening has never before revealed the city on which the fictional Springfield was based - or at least named.  "I don’t want to ruin it for people, you know?" he said in the interview . "Whenever people say it’s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, 'Yup, that’s right.'"  The cartoonist, who also created the long-running science fiction animation Futurama, grew up in Oregon. He named many elements of the show after his own life. His father was named Homer, for instance, and his family lived on Evergreen Terrace - just as the Simpson family do on the cartoon.  "My family lived on a long, windy road on a little dead-end street called Evergreen Terrace," he said. "Also the name of the street the Simpsons live on - and in order to visit any friends I had to walk at least a mile through the woods to get to their house."

Whilst researching one of my favourite scenes from one of my favourite movies, I was scandalised, shocked and outraged to discover that it regularly ranks amongst the most misquoted . Apparently, lesser mortals fail to match Bette Davis’s effortless, defiant and disdainful delivery of All About Eve’s classic line ‘Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy night’. In fact, they dare to replace ‘night’ with ‘ride’. What would Bette think? Well if Margot Channing, her character in the film is anything to go by, she’d probably offer those naïve fools ‘a milkshake’.  But perhaps they should be forgiven. Not to give the line (and Davies’s delivery) less than it’s due, but it sits within a wonderfully accomplished and articulate dialogue, written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (who also directed the film). Every scene is filled with cutting and witty asides that perfectly capture ‘theatre folk’ and their preoccupations. So, in a film filled with perfection (the critic Richard Schickel once claimed Mankiewicz was “one of the tiny handful of epigrammists that have written for the screen”) – why this particular line and the particular cocktail party scene?  Firstly, this is a key scene within the movie. All the main players are present and correct, and this is the first time the viewer is able to assess how individual motivations and secret agendas fit together. Secondly, it’s Margo’s opportunity to really display just how she feels about Eve Harrington (played by Anne Baxter), timid, shy Eve who wouldn’t say boo to goose but has inserted herself rather too well in Margo’s life. The audience is already aware of Margo’s growing jealousy, but this is the first time it spills over and becomes apparent to the other characters. In the process, Mankiewicz sets up one of the movie’s central themes – the established actress who’s terrified of aging and the fledgling talent who can’t wait to take her place.  At this point it’s definitely Eve we side with, but there’s always a frisson of sympathy for Margo. Those cutting put-downs and her difficult ways mask fear and paranoia – but ironically Davis was never better than in this film. Growing old suited her, as it eventually suits Margo Channing – both just have to realise that it’s an inevitability to be celebrated rather then ignored. Later, Davis recognised that the role was the greatest break at that of her career, that Mankiewicz ‘resurrected me from the dead’. A typically theatrical response from Davis, and one that could have been spoken by Channing herself.  During the cocktail party scene, fork-tongued theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) arrives with yet another youthful, luminous wannabe star, Miss Caswell (Marilyn Monroe). Margo, who has already made it clear DeWitt isn’t her favourite guest (“I distinctly remember, Addison, crossing you off my guest-list. What are you doing here?”) is cool yet Miss Caswell takes it in her stride. Monroe’s role in the film is brief but impactful and, although surrounded by actors with considerably more experience, seems to draw all the attention. In a foreshadowing of the ‘Monroe’ stereotype DeWitt steers her towards a powerful producer. “Go and do yourself some good”, he advises. She acquiesces, asking “Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?”. Margo is left holding Miss Caswell’s opulent fur stole. ‘Amen’, she proclaims, holding her glass in toast.  That bitterness speaks to us all. As Margo will observe later in the film, in a ‘softer’ moment: “There’s one career all females have in common, whether we like it or not. Sooner or later, we’ve got to work at it, no matter how | Question: "Which actress said in the film All About Eve, ""Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night""?" ?

A:  Quick Answer  Tintin, the title character of a comic series by Belgian artist Herge, is joined in his adventures by his dog Snowy. In the original series, Snowy is known as Milou, after a pet name the artist had for his first girlfriend.  Full Answer  Snowy is a white fox terrier, and Herge has stated that he chose this particular breed due to its popularity at the time of creating the comic. Additionally, the artist found inspiration at a cafe he frequented; the cafe landlord was the proud owner of a fox terrier.  Initially in the series, Snowy and Tintin can directly communicate. Over time, though, other main characters are added and the terrier's speaking role is omitted in favor of a non-verbal comedic one.

Revised: 24 September 2013.  Latest change: corrected entries under Czech and Slovakian - thanks to Ivana for advising the correct names. Corrected Tintin's name in Basque - thanks to Gorka for the correction.  English  Johnes  Notes  Bengali: In Bengali, Thomson and Thompson are referred to as “Manikjor” (twins) as a team; individually they are “Johnson” and “Ronson”. [AB] and [Sambeet]  Farsi/Persian: When the Persian/Farsi Tintin books were re-printed, some character names  got changed to conform to the English translations. While Tintin is still Tan-Tan, Milou is now Barfy (literally “snowy”), Douponte and Doupone are now Thomson and Thompson (pronounced in Persian the same as in English), and Professor Calculus is Calcooles (Persian transliteration of Calculus). [DP]  Indonesian: Names of main Tintin characters in Indonesian albums published by Indira before April 2008: Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, Calculus, Thomson, Thompson. [MM]  Slovakian: No official translation in Slovakian exists. According to reader Ivana: “We [Slovaks] have accepted the Czech translation, as we understand the language.”  Turkish: In some Turkish translations, Milou’s name is Fındık, which roughly translates as nut. The name “Boncuk” (meaning “bead”) appears in translations from the 1980s and 1990s. Professor Tournesol’s name mostly appears as “Turnesol”, but “Turnösol” has also been used. [Başar Kocaoğlu]  Tintin - Tintin Wiki - WikiaTintin | Tintin Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  "Eureka!"  —Tintin  Tintin is a reporter, adventurer, traveler, and the protagonist of the popular comic book series The Adventures of Tintin, which was written by the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known as Hergé (1907–1983).  Contents  [ show ]  Biography  Tintin made his first appearance in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets (1929–1930) as a journalist reporting on the Bolsheviks of Soviet Russia with his loyal dog Snowy and soon evolved into an investigative reporter and crime-buster whose curiosity draws him into the dangerous circles of drug-traffickers and mercenaries. Tintin seems to be physically quite strong as he sometimes defeats criminals without much difficulty with punches and once easily broke a door in The Secret of the Unicorn .  Hergé never explicitly confirmed Tintin's nationality, but vaguely refers to him as Belgian and living in Brussels (the streets of Brussels are unmistakable in the backdrop of The Secret of the Unicorn and The Red Sea Sharks . Further more, in Tintin in Tibet , the address written on Chang ‘s letter was "比國布魯塞爾", which means "Brussels, Belgium") | Question: What is the English name of the dog belonging to cartoon character TinTin?
