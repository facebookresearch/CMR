The descendants of his seven sons and five daughters contested the throne for generations, climaxing in the Wars of the Roses (1455–85).  Edward III, watercolour, 15th century; in the British Library (Cotton MS. Julius E. IV).  By permission of the British Library  Early years  The eldest son of Edward II and Isabella of France , Edward III was summoned to Parliament as earl of Chester (1320) and was made duke of Aquitaine (1325), but, contrary to tradition, he never received the title of prince of Wales.  Edward III grew up amid struggles between his father and a number of barons who were attempting to limit the king’s power and to strengthen their own role in governing England. His mother, repelled by her husband’s treatment of the nobles and disaffected by the confiscation of her English estates by his supporters, played an important role in this conflict. In 1325 she left England to return to France to intervene in the dispute between her brother, Charles IV of France, and her husband over the latter’s French possessions, Guyenne , Gascony , and Ponthieu. She was successful; the land was secured for England on condition that the English king pay homage to Charles. This was performed on the king’s behalf by his young son.  United Kingdom: Edward III (1327–77)  The heir apparent was secure at his mother’s side. With Roger Mortimer , an influential baron who had escaped to France in 1323 and had become her lover, Isabella now began preparations to invade England to depose her husband. To raise funds for this enterprise, Edward III was betrothed to Philippa , daughter of William, count of Hainaut and Holland.  Within five months of their invasion of England, the queen and the nobles, who had much popular support, overpowered the king’s forces. Edward II, charged with incompetence and breaking his coronation oath, was forced to resign, and on January 29, 1327, Edward III, aged 14, was crowned king of England.  During the next four years Isabella and Mortimer governed in his name, though nominally his guardian was Henry, earl of Lancaster . In the summer of 1327 he took part in an abortive campaign against the Scots, which resulted in the Treaty of Northampton (1328), making Scotland an independent realm. Edward was deeply troubled by the settlement and signed it only after much persuasion by Isabella and Mortimer. He married Philippa at York on January 24, 1328. Soon afterward Edward made a successful effort to throw off his degrading dependence on his mother and Mortimer. While a council was being held at Nottingham, he entered the castle by night, through a subterranean passage, took Mortimer prisoner, and had him executed (November 1330). Edward had discreetly ignored his mother’s liaison with Mortimer and treated her with every respect, but her political influence was at an end.  Britannica Stories  Cheetahs Face Extinction Risk  Edward III now began to rule as well as to reign. Young, ardent , and active, he sought to remake England into the powerful nation it had been under Edward I . He still resented the concession of independence made to Scotland by the Treaty of Northampton. The death of Robert I , the Bruce, king of Scotland, in 1329 gave him a chance of retrieving his position. The new king of Scots, his brother-in-law, David II , was a mere boy, and Edward took advantage of his weakness to aid the Scottish barons who had been exiled by Bruce to place their leader, Edward Balliol, on the Scottish throne. David II fled to France, but Balliol was despised as a puppet | Question: Who was King of England in 1350?

Mammy Two Shoes (sometimes Mrs. Two Shoes) is a recurring character in MGM 's Tom and Jerry cartoons. She is a heavy-set middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters.  As a partially seen character , she was famous for never showing her face (except very briefly in Saturday Evening Puss ). Mammy's appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. It was later revealed that her character was greatly inspired by Oscar -winning black actress and singer Hattie McDaniel , best known for playing "Mammy" in MGM and David O. Selznick 's 1939 film Gone with the Wind .  A character very similar to Mammy Two Shoes had earlier been portrayed in the Disney Silly Symphonies shorts Three Orphan Kittens and More Kittens , as well as the Pluto short Pantry Pirate and the Figaro short Figaro and Cleo . A similar character Aunt Petunia the Mammy actually shows her face which resembles blackface in The Little Audrey Cartoon Series .  Contents  7 References    Theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoons    Mammy Two Shoes, in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , whose full face was shown for the first time.  Mammy first appeared in Puss Gets the Boot , the first Tom and Jerry cartoon (except Tom was called "Jasper"). She always referred to Tom as his given name Thomas and almost always used "is" in conjunction with a pronoun ("is you" and "I is"). The character went on to make many appearances through the entire series until 1952 and her last appearance in the short, Push-Button Kitty . William Hanna and Joseph Barbera initially portrayed Mammy as the maid of the house, with the real owners unknown to us. Later, Hanna and Barbera seemed to suggest, through dialogue and occasional behavior, that the house was Mammy's own.  Mammy was originally voiced by well-known African-American character actress Lillian Randolph . In the 1960s, the MGM animation studio , by then under the supervision of Chuck Jones , created censored versions of the Tom & Jerry cartoons featuring Mammy for television. These versions used rotoscoping techniques to replace Mammy on-screen with a similarly stocky white woman (in most shorts) or a thin white woman (in Saturday Evening Puss); Randolph's voice on the soundtracks was replaced by an Irish-accented (or, in Puss, generic young adult) voice performed by white actress June Foray . [1]  The original versions of the cartoons were reinstated when Turner Broadcasting acquired ownership of the Tom & Jerry property. But in 1992, the cartoons featuring Mammy were edited again; this time, to replace Lillian Randolph's voice with that of Thea Vidale , who re-recorded the dialogue to remove Mammy's use of potentially offensive dialect . These re-recorded versions of the cartoons are aired to this day on Turner's Cartoon Network -related cable channels, and have at times turned up on DVD as well. However, some European TV showings of these cartoons, especially the UK, retain Randolph's original voice. The Region 2 Complete Collectors Edition DVD boxset has Vidale's voice on the first DVD and Randolph in a number of the episodes after that (such as A Mouse in the House and Mouse Cleaning ).    Replacement characters for Mammy  From 1954's Pet Peeve , Mammy disappeared from Tom and Jerry; the owners of the animals' house became a young, white, middle-class couple named Joan and George , and starting with 1955's The Flying Sorceress , the audience was able to see these owners' heads.  In 1961, when Rembrandt Films began producing Tom and Jerry shorts, the owner of the house became a corpulent white man.

Boxing Fight Record: won 39 (KO 23) & lost 9 Boxing Fights   History of Alan Alan Minter Boxing Career Set     Alan Minter Career Set won five boxing fights in a row by knockout and, in 1973, Pat Dwyer became the first boxer to go the distance with him, over eight rounds. Alan Minter won his next five boxing fights, three by knockout, before tasting defeat for the first time after the referee stopped the fight in the eighth round to King George Aido due to bad cuts suffered by Alan Minter. Two more wins followed before facing Jan Magziarz, who beat him twice in a row again due to cuts.  1974 was a diverse year for Alan  Minter, defeating Tony Byrne by a result in eight, losing in two to  Ricky Torres again on cuts, having a third fight with Magziarz result in  a no boxing fight in four rounds and closing the year with a win in  eight rounds by result in his first worldwide fight, against Shako Mamba  in Hamburg, Germany.In 1975, he won four fights in a row, including another boxing bout in Hamburg and, by the end of the year, he challenged Kevin Finnegan for the British boxing Middleweight title, captivating it by a 15 round decision. In 1976 he won six fights, to extend his streak to ten successive wins.These wins gave Alan Minter a status among the top ten boxing Middleweight challengers.  In 1977, he won the European boxing Middleweight title by beating Germano Valsecchi by a knockout in five in Italy. But in his next boxing fight his winning line ended when he lost to former world title challenger Ronnie Harris by a knockout in eight. Alan Minter returned to top ten contender status by upsetting the former World Welterweight and Light Middleweight Champion Emile Griffith with a ten round decision win in Monte Carlo, but then he lost his European title to Gratien Tonna by a knockout in eight at Milan. He closed '77 with a third 15 round decision win over Finnegan to retain his British title.  1978 was a bad year for Alan Minter, even though he won all three of his boxing bouts. On 15 February, at the Muhammad Ali vs Leon Spinks I undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, he won his first bout in the United States by knocking out Sandy Torres in five. Then, he went to Italy once once more to get back his European Middleweight title by knocking out Angelo Jacopucci in twelve rounds. Jacopucci died a few days afterwards, due to injuries sustained in the bout. Alan Minter completed his year by avenging his loss to Tonna with a six round boxing knockout.  In 1979, Alan Minter won all four of his boxing fights, two of them by knockout. On 16 March 1980, in Las Vegas, he was given a attempt at World Middleweight Boxing Champion Vito Antuofermo's title at the Caesars Palace. He won the title by a 15 round result and, in a rematch, he retained the world title by a TKO in eight rounds. Alan Minter's run as world boxing champion came to an end on 27 September of that year, when he was stopped on cuts in three rounds to Marvin Hagler at Wembley Arena in London. After the fight was stopped, Alan Minter's followers caused a riot, throwing beer cans into the boxing ring and both boxers had to be ushered away by the police. Earlier to the fight, Alan Minter made the obviously racist statement on the BBC that, "that black man is not going to take my title away." He later retracted this statement and said he meant "no man" is going to take my title away.     Alan Minter : Reflection of 1980s - The Living DaylightsAlan Minter : Reflection of 1980s  Comment  ****  Alan Minter was perhaps the most popular man in Britain heading into his fateful clash against Marvin Hagler on September 27, 1980.  After winning the world title in March in Las Vegas from Vito Antuofermo, the new champion turned in | Question: Alan Minter was World boxing champion at which weight?
