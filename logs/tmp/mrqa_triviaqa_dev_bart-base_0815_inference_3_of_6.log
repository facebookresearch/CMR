It is the largest lake in Central America and one of the very few, or perhaps the only, freshwater lake to have sharks, although their numbers have dropped precipitously.  The adventurous are rewarded by the splendor of volcanoes, jungle villages, placid lakes, and pristine beaches, untouched islands, like you'll find boating in Lago de Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America and home to rare freshwater sharks. Or perhaps you'll discover a remote surf break on the southwestern Pacific coast.  Largest Lake In Central America Nicaragua is home to the largest lake in Central America locally known as Cocibolca or Lake Nicaragua. Nearly 20% of the total landmass of Nicaragua is set aside in 78 different National Parks and protected areas.  People considered digging a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama-if they had used Nicaragua, they would have dug a canal to Lake Nicaragua (the largest lake in Central America), then another one away from it. Instead, it was dug through the Isthmus of Panama.  The largest Central American nation, Nicaragua, is full of parks and reserves and more lakes than any other Central American nation. Located between Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south and with long coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, Nicaragua is about one-third tropical rainforests and is split in half by a mountain range scattered with volcanoes.  Also known as La Mar Dulce (the Sweet Sea), Lake Nicaragua is the largest lake in Central America and the tenth largest freshwater lake in the world. Forty-five rivers flow into the lake and it is home to the worlds only species of freshwater shark.  The lake is connected to the Caribbean Sea by the San Juan River, historically making the lakeside city of Granada, Nicaragua an Atlantic port although it is closer to the Pacific. The lake has a history of Caribbean pirates which assaulted nearby Granada on three occasions.[1]. Despite draining into the Caribbean Sea, the Pacific Ocean is near enough to be seen from the mountains of Ometepe.  Before construction of the Panama Canal, a stagecoach line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company connected the lake with the Pacific across the low hills of the narrow Isthmus of Rivas. Plans were made to take advantage of this route to build an interoceanic canal, the Nicaragua Canal, but the Panama Canal was built instead. In order to quell competition with the Panama Canal, the U.S. secured all rights to a canal along this route in the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty of 1916. However, the idea of another canal in Nicaragua still periodically resurfaces. Ecocanal is one of these projects.  What is the Largest Lake in Central America - Want to Know itWhat is the Largest Lake in Central America  What is the Largest Lake in Central America  27 Nov, 2012 what is  0  Central America is generally regarded as the region between North America and South America. It is considered to be a subcontinent, rather than being a part of either continent. There are seven countries in this region called; Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Belize. Central America covers about 534,000 km2 (202,000 sq mi), which is just 0.1% of the Earth’s surface! Despite this fact, Central America is home to the 19th largest lake in the world (by area). Let’s find out the name of this lake and where it is located.  What is the largest lake in Central America?

As the heir to a major European banking business, he used his family’s vast wealth to fund painters, sculptors, and architects, helping Florence emerge as a cultural center and spurring the Renaissance at great personal cost. He led the city-state as a despot, using everything from friendship to threats to secure and maintain his power. He cared greatly about Florence’s success, even putting himself in harm’s way to settle conflicts with rivals.  "I do not regret [spending 663,000 florins for charity, buildings, and taxes] for though many would consider it better to have a part of that sum in their purse, I consider it to have been a great honor to our state, and I think the money was well-expended and I am well-pleased."  Quoted (1471) in Living on the Edge in Leonardo’s Florence, edited by Gene A. Brucker, 2005, Google Books  Biography  Lorenzo de’ Medici assumed power in the city-state of Florence in 1469. The Medicis were among the foremost bankers in Europe at the time, accumulating great wealth, and they had ruled the republic for years. Lorenzo continued the family tradition of leading as a despot, and he centralized power through strategic friendships, marriages, bribes, and threats.  Despite this strength, Lorenzo’s rule was not unchallenged. In 1478, the Pazzi conspiracy – named for the rival banking family that instigated an attempted coup – tried to assassinate Lorenzo, injuring him and killing his brother. The attempt occurred with the knowledge of the Pope, and when Lorenzo retaliated against the conspirators, the Catholic Church (backed by soldiers from Naples) entered a state of war with Florence.  Lorenzo inspired Florentines to defend their city-state. However, as war dragged on, Lorenzo boldly decided to force peace talks by sailing to Naples personally. There he remained in the king’s hands for three months, until the king – impressed by Lorenzo’s action – agreed to end the violence. Lorenzo used this event to consolidate more power, as he could now argue that he knew the best way to handle threats to Florence.  Meanwhile, Lorenzo became one of the foremost artistic patrons in Florence, and all of Italy. He sponsored Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Sandro Botticelli. This set an example that spurred patronage across Renaissance Italy. de’ Medici also supported humanists, creating a library with classical works from the East. He expanded the Medici library and encouraged the study of classic literature in Florence and across Europe. Although the money he spent meant he left the Medici bank weaker than when he inherited it, he was groundbreaking in his support for the arts.  What Made Lorenzo de' Medici A leader?  Florence was a leading artistic city during the Renaissance, and Lorenzo de’ Medici was one of its most enthusiastic patrons. He set an example for the city to by endorsing several of the period’s leading artists.  Through multiple arrangements and marriages, de’ Medici assured his family of power in the Catholic Church (there were four Medici popes) and across Europe.  Lorenzo’s actions following the Pazzi Conspiracy showed his willingness to take risks on behalf of his people, and once he returned, the Florentine people were willing to follow him even after he used the event to centralize his power.  The Medici banking clan continued its prominence through Lorenzo’s reign, meaning that he did not just lead the city politically, but also economically. He used this money to promote art and architecture, enhancing Florence’s reputation as a cultural center.  Discover More About Lorenzo de' Medici  Keywords  Print  Hibbert, Christopher.

Since 2010, the tallest structure in London has been The Shard, which was topped out at , making it the tallest habitable building in Europe at the time. The second tallest is One Canada Square in Canary Wharf, which rises 235 m and was completed in 1991.  The third tallest is the Heron Tower in the City of London financial district, which was topped out in 2010 and stands at a height of 230 m, including its spire.  The Greater London area is currently about level with the Paris Metropolitan Area as the metropolitan area in the European Union with the most skyscrapers. As of 2015, there are 16 skyscrapers in London that reach a roof height of at least 150 m, with 17 in Paris (compared to 15 in Frankfurt, eleven in Warsaw and five in Madrid).  The history of tall structures in London began with the completion of the 27 m White Tower, a part of the Tower of London, in 1098.   The first structure to surpass a height of 100 m was the Old St Paul's Cathedral. Completed in 1310, it stood at a height of 150 m.  St Paul's was the world's tallest structure until 1311, when its height was surpassed by Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln. It regained the title when the spire of Lincoln Cathedral fell in 1549.  Although the spire of the Old St Paul's was destroyed by lightning in 1561, it still stood as the tallest structure in London, while the world's tallest structure became Strasbourg Cathedral in Strasbourg, France. St Paul's was severely damaged by the Great Fire of London in 1666. The title of the tallest structure in London passed to Southwark Cathedral, which stands at a height of 50 m  and no structure in London again rose above 100 metres until 1710, when the current St Paul's Cathedral was completed.   At 111 m, the cathedral remained London's tallest building until it was overtaken in 1962 by the BT Tower, which was topped out in 1964 and officially opened in 1965.  Few skyscrapers were built in London before the end of the last century, owing to restrictions on building heights originally imposed by the London Building Act of 1894, which followed the construction of the 14-storey Queen Anne's Mansions. Though restrictions have long since been eased, strict regulations remain to preserve protected views, especially those of St Paul's, the Tower of London and Palace of Westminster, as well as to comply with the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority.  The lifting of height restrictions caused a boom in the construction of tall buildings during the 1960s. One of London's first notable tall buildings was the 117 m Centre Point, completed in 1966. The National Westminster Tower (now called Tower 42) followed in 1980, which at 183 m became London's first genuine "skyscraper" by international standards. It was followed in 1991 by One Canada Square, which formed the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf development. Following a 10-year gap, several new skyscrapers appeared on London's skyline: 8 Canada Square, 25 Canada Square (both also at Canary Wharf), the Heron Quays buildings, One Churchill Place, the Broadgate Tower and the gherkin-shaped 30 St Mary Axe. Some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the Emporis Skyscraper Award in 2003  and the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2004.   With the precedent set by the towers of Canary Wharf and with the encouragement of former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, a renewed trend for building tall has been established in recent years. As of April 2016, there were 71 structures under construction or proposed in London that will rise at least 100 metres in height, including the South Bank Tower, which is being increased in height by 11 storeys.  1 Undershaft, planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster, is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London.
