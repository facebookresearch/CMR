Find out more: http://sky.com/tv/show/k  Karl Pilkington is best known as the star of Sky1 travel documentary series An Idiot Abroad and The Moaning of Life. Karl is also the author of six best selling books, with his seventh entitled More Moaning, to be released in June 2016.  The Moaning of Life saw Karl set off around the world to experience how other cultures faced up to life’s big issues as he made plans for his future, and it continues to be heralded as one of Sky1’s most popular ever programs. Series 2 was 275% above the slot average with extremely high social media engagement. Series 1 was Sky1’s most successful home-grown show that year with over 2.3 million people watching the first episode alone, as well as generating record On Demand and Sky Go viewing figures for non-scripted programming on Sky. It has now been seen by millions of viewers around the world.  An Idiot Abroad saw Karl being sent around the world by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant on a journey of self discovery. The program spanned three series, culminating in Karl being joined by actor Warwick Davis on an epic journey following the famous explorer Marco Polo from Venice to Eastern Europe, India and China as they got stuck into different cultures and traditions, illuminated by Karl’s trademark observations about the world and Warwick’s varying experiences as a little person in different countries.  The An Idiot Abroad brand has grown from strength to strength. The second series was nominated for a BAFTA® Television Award, adding to previous nods from the British Comedy, National Television, Royal Television Society, Broadcast and Broadcasting Press Guild awards. The series have been sold to over 200 territories worldwide. The accompanying DVDs (distributed by BBC Worldwide) have sold over a million copies and books (published by Canongate) have sold over a million copies in the UK alone, with the first book hitting the Top Ten in hardback in the autumn of 2010 and the No.1 spot on the paperback list in the autumn of 2011. The books have spent 50 weeks in total in the Sunday Times Top 10 bestseller lists. Most recently the accompanying The Moaning of Life book also spent 10 weeks in the Sunday Times best seller list in both hardback and paperback.  The Ricky Gervais Show started out life as a radio programme on London station XFM, which began in 2001 and aired weekly for months at a time during 2002, 2003 and 2004. Karl was an off-air producer for Ricky and Stephen but he didn’t stay off-air for long and his antics and opinions along with his fascination for odd stuff, distrust of animals and dislike of crowds meant that he became a much more vocal part of the show and became the cult hero of the XFM broadcasts.  A series of record-breaking podcasts with Ricky and Stephen followed, making Karl a household name around the world. The podcasts went to number 1 in 14 countries including America and became the most downloaded in history according to Guinness World Records, having gained an average of 261,670 downloads per episode during its first month. The podcasts have remained at the top of the charts, outselling, albums, TV and film, currently having been downloaded over 300 million times.  The podcasts were eventually animated for both HBO in the US and E4 in the UK. US-based producer Media Rights Company (MRC) along with Wildbrain, the animation studio behind YoGabbaGabba, made the show.  Karl’s classic quote, “I could eat a knob at night,” has spawned dance records, merchandise and a thousand online discussions – one such discussion leading to the conclusion that Karl isn’t real but is in fact a comedy character invented by Ricky and Stephen. The real thing was first seen in all his glory in a twenty-minute interview, which appeared on Ricky Gervais’ live stand-up comedy DVD, Politics.

Fast count: A ballot box is rushed into the Silksworth Centre during the 2010 General Election count.  Kevin Clark  Have your say  THE eyes of the nation will be on Wearside tomorrow night, as Sunderland races to produce the first result of the General Election.  The city has been the first to announce in the last five General Election and council chiefs will be hoping to make it six in a row this time.  The prime aim is running an accurate and efficient election count for voters and candidates. If we happen to be first, that’s a bonus.  City council chief executive Dave Smith  Sunderland declared the first three results of the 2010 election, with the counting all wrapped up in barely an hour-and-a-half.  Houghton and Sunderland South’s Bridget Phillipson was the first member of the new Parliament to be announced, with victory confirmed less than an hour after the polls closed.  The first declaration of the evening came at 10.52pm, followed by Washington and Sunderland West’s Sharon Hodgson, whose win was confirmed at 11.25pm, and Sunderland Central, where Julie Elliott’s victory was announced at 11.41pm.  It was the second time in a row Sunderland had declared the first three constituencies nationwide and the fifth General Election in a row  in which the city has been the first to declare a constituency.  City council chief executive Dave Smith said the main aim was to provide an accurate count: “What we’re aiming to do is run an efficient election and declare accurate results as quickly as we can.  “The prime aim is running an accurate and efficient election count for voters and candidates. If we happen to be first, that’s a bonus.  “Many of the counters are council staff and they do this every election year, some are bank staff and there’s a lot of experience. The counters have induction sessions before joining and the city council has lots of experience at these counts, so we’ve honed and improved our techniques over the years.”  Preparations have been under way for months, said Mr Smith.  “There’s a lot of planning and improving on what we’ve done in previous years; so if you get a lot of marginal gains and improvements then these can help improve the bigger picture,” he added.  “Planning for this General Election has been, in a sense, going on for sometime now. Electoral staff have been taking feedback from previous counts, from last year’s local council elections and European election, speaking to other electoral officers across the country, and looking at the guidance that comes from the Electoral Commission.”  Being the leader of the pack means there is huge media interest in the Sunderland count.  Representatives of national press and TV will cram into the Silksworth Sports Complex for tomorrow night’s count, but Dr Smith is confident the team will not be phased by the attention.  “All election counts have their observers,” he said.

He hasn’t quite decided what kind it’ll be, but the shoes have been bought, and he’s wearing them in as he pads around the city’s Civic Centre, a brutal brick monstrosity that doesn’t look like it’s seen much care for 40 years or more.  Between 1975 and 1992, Crawford oversaw a team of staff who would count the city’s results, and announce them in the early morning of the day after polling day.

08/15/2021 15:41:35 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Harrison Stickle | NatureflipHarrison Stickle | Natureflip  Harrison Stickle  View on Map  About Harrison Stickle  Harrison Stickle is the highest of the Langdale Pikes; the other two usually classed in this group are Pike of Stickle and Loft Crag – sometimes, Pavey Ark is included as a fourth. These lie in the Central Fells area of the Lake District, and together they make up some of the best known and most photographed peaks in Lakeland. Harrison Stickle stands at an elevation of 736 m (2,415 ft) and a prominence of around 53 m (174 ft), which means it is also classed as a Hewitt and a Nuttall.  Its summit consists of a short, rocky ridge with a cairn standing at each end. From here, hikers can see all the major fell groups lying around and about the peak, with especially fine views down to Great Langdale and Windermere.  Climbing Harrison Stickle  The most commonly used starting point for routes to the summit of Harrison Stickle begins at New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel, Great Langdale. From here, walkers usually pursue a circular route that can take in up to eight of Wainwright’s listed peaks: the three Langdale Pikes, Pavey Ark, Thunacar Knott, High Raise, Sergeant Man and Blea Rigg. This makes for a very full day’s walking and is rewarding in terms of the spectacular views. If you have less time or energy available, the simplest route runs from the same hotel, following Stickle Beck to Stickle Tarn; and then the path leading up the western side of Pavey Ark to the summit of Harrison Stickle.  Landscape: Mountain  Wainwright Walks Pavey Ark - GuideUsWainwright Walks Pavey Ark  Wainwright Walks Pavey Ark  Wainwright Fells Map & Tick List  £9.99  Area: Wainwright Central Fells  Pavey Ark is part of the group of Wainwright Fells that includes the Langdale Pikes, and is sometimes included with Loft Crag, Harrison Stickle and Pike of Stickle in the definition of the Pikes. A Wainwright walk to the top of Pavey Ark is often carried out via a boulder strewn steep path called Jake's Rake, which gets to the summit from Stickle Tarn by way of an awkward, but exhilarating climb that requires use of the arms as well as the legs to getpast. Technically the eastern face of Pavey Ark is actually a cliff, so youknow a Wainwright walk to the summit via Jake's Rake is something of achallenge! However, if scrambling is not your thing, after reaching StickleTarn from the New Dungeon Ghyll in Langdale, easier routes to the top can befound to either side of the craggy cliff face.  If you are intent of completing as many peaks as possible from a map of the Wainwrights, Pavey Ark is a good choice for a Wainwright walk that includes the other Langdale Pikes, with Pavey Ark being the last or first in a round including Pike O'Stickle, Harrison Stickle and Loft Crag, depending on the direction the walk in carried out from the New Dungeon Ghyll. In addition, some Wainwright walkers will also include nearby Thunacar Knott, while the most ambitious can complete a day's Wainwright walking by including Sergeant Man and High Raise (Langdale). This final route has the benefit of completing seven peaks from your Wainwright Maps.  From the top of Pavey Ark, those completing a Wainwright walk will have good views of the southern and eastern fells, together with Stickle Tarn at the bottom of Jake's Rake. The large mass of High Raise is well seen too, though it does block the view to the north so the finest views are to be had facing the opposite direction.  Further information on the Langdale Pikes and Pavey Ark is contained in Book Three: The Central Fells, by A. Wainwright, a volume of the Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.
