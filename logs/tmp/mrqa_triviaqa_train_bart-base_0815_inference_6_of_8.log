How will it end? Who was the first man? Where do souls go after death?’…The second function of myth is to justify an existing social system and account for traditional rites and customs.” In ancient Greece, stories about gods and goddesses and heroes and monsters were an important part of everyday life. They explained everything from religious rituals to the weather, and they gave meaning to the world people saw around them.  Google  Greek Mythology: Sources  In Greek mythology, there is no single original text like the Christian Bible or the Hindu Vedas that introduces all of the myths’ characters and stories. Instead, the earliest Greek myths were part of an oral tradition that began in the Bronze Age, and their plots and themes unfolded gradually in the written literature of the archaic and classical periods. The poet Homer’s 8th-century BC epics the Iliad and the Odyssey, for example, tell the story of the (mythical) Trojan War as a divine conflict as well as a human one. They do not, however, bother to introduce the gods and goddesses who are their main characters, since readers and listeners would already have been familiar with them.  Did You Know?  Many consumer products get their names from Greek mythology. Nike sneakers are the namesake of the goddess of victory, for example, and the website Amazon.com is named after the race of mythical female warriors. Many high school, college and professional sports teams (Titans, Spartans and Trojans, for instance) also get their names from mythological sources.  Around 700 BC, the poet Hesiod’s Theogony offered the first written cosmogony, or origin story, of Greek mythology. The Theogony tells the story of the universe’s journey from nothingness (Chaos, a primeval void) to being, and details an elaborate family tree of elements, gods and goddesses who evolved from Chaos and descended from Gaia (Earth), Ouranos (Sky), Pontos (Sea) and Tartaros (the Underworld).  Later Greek writers and artists used and elaborated upon these sources in their own work. For instance, mythological figures and events appear in the 5th-century plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides and the lyric poems of Pindar. Writers such as the 2nd-century BC Greek mythographer Apollodorus of Athens and the 1st-century BC Roman historian Gaius Julius Hyginus compiled the ancient myths and legends for contemporary audiences.  Greek Mythology: The Olympians  At the center of Greek mythology is the pantheon of deities who were said to live on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. From their perch, they ruled every aspect of human life. Olympian gods and goddesses looked like men and women (though they could change themselves into animals and other things) and were–as many myths recounted–vulnerable to human foibles and passions.  The twelve main Olympians are:  Zeus (Jupiter, in Roman mythology): the king of all the gods (and father to many) and god of weather, law and fate  Hera (Juno): the queen of the gods and goddess of women and marriage  Aphrodite (Venus): goddess of beauty and love  Apollo (Apollo): god of prophesy, music and poetry and knowledge  Ares (Mars): god of war  Artemis (Diana): goddess of hunting, animals and childbirth  Athena (Minerva): goddess of wisdom and defense  Demeter (Ceres): goddess of agriculture and grain  Dionysos (Bacchus): god of wine, pleasure and festivity  Hephaistos (Vulcan): god of fire, metalworking and sculpture  Hermes (Mercury): god of travel, hospitality and trade and Zeus’s personal messenger  Poseidon (Neptune): god of the sea  Other gods and goddesses sometimes included in the roster of Olympians are: | Question: Who was the Greek Queen of the Gods?

Here is a brief history:   The first canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas via the Nile River was dug in 1874 B.C. during the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Senausret III. It was abandoned and reopened several times over the subsequent 2,500 years.   Pharonic inscriptions showed that Egyptians used the canals to move warships, send pilgrimages to the Holy Land and transport grain and stones used in ancient monuments.   Napoleon sought to build a modern canal in order to undermine Britain's control of trading routes to Asia, but he abandoned the project after engineers wrongly determined that a difference in water levels would cause the Mediterranean to be inundated.   French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps and Egyptian viceroy Said Pasha developed the current Suez Canal in the mid-19th century. French and Egyptian private interests controlled the company entrusted with building and running the canal, though Britain later acquired Egypt's share.   Completion of the 163-kilometre (101 mile) waterway took 10 years of intense and generally poorly-paid work by Egyptians who were drafted at the rate of 20,000 every 10 months from "the peasantry."   The canal, which was opened for navigation on Nov. 17, 1869, cut weeks if not months off journeys between Europe and Asia that otherwise necessitated a trip around Africa. Numerous heads of state visited Egypt for weeks of celebrations.   In 1956, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the canal, leading to a failed invasion by Britain, which controlled the channel, as well as France and Israel. The waterway was closed briefly until 1957 and the again for eight years following the 1967 war with Israel.   President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced on Tuesday that Egypt would build a new channel as part of a larger project to expand port and shipping facilities around the canal in an effort to establish Egypt as a major trade hub.  Primary Source: Suez Canal Authority  Suez Canal, Egypt | Building the WorldSuez Canal, Egypt | Building the World  Building the World  Entrance to Port Said on the Suez Canal circa 1856, from Library of Congress, at loc.gov.  WHY EGYPT?  The Middle East is one of the most important regions in the world. Land of the ancient pyramids, home of the mighty Nile, Egypt’s Suez Canal transformed shipping as far away as Singapore . Egypt is critical to the future of the region and the world, and so is the Suez Canal.  PHARAOH’S DREAM OR CALIPH’S NIGHTMARE?  The waterway, perhaps initiated by the legendary Pharaoh Sesostris, was navigated by Egyptians during Seti I in 1380 B.C. The ancient channel – still visible in areas near Wadi Tumilat and actually used by constructors of the Suez Canal – did not connect all the way to the Red Sea; at the time of Darius, 520 B.C., ships entering from the Mediterranean traversed the Pelusiac section of the Nile to Bubastis, where they continued to Heropolis. But there was a break at that point; all cargo had to be reloaded onto ships on the Red Sea. It was good business for transfer specialists but not for shippers.  In 385 B.C., Ptolemy Philadelphus finally connected the canal to the Red Sea, building a new town called Arsinoe at the juncture. But the waterway proved only too strategic and was ordered closed in 770 A.D. by the Caliph al-Mansur, founder of Baghdad , to cut off the supply route being used by his enemies.  CHILDHOOD FRIENDSHIP  Ferdinand de Lesseps, from bbc.co.uk.  If war closed the earlier canal, diplomacy and friendship eventually opened it to the world. It’s the story of two boys who played together. One, Ferdinand de Lesseps, was the son of a French diplomat; the other, scion of the Pasha of | Question: Which waterway was developed by Ferdinand de Lesseps and opened in 1869?
