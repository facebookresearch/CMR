Since then , summer games have usually -- but not always -- celebrated a four - year period known as an Olympiad . There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities , and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities . In addition , three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war : Berlin ( summer ) in 1916 ; Tokyo / Helsinki ( summer ) and Sapporo / Garmisch - Partenkirchen ( winter ) in 1940 ; and London ( summer ) and Cortina d'Ampezzo , Italy ( winter ) in 1944 . The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However , in 1949 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games . Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games : Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics . | Question: where will be the next olympics be held ?

07/29/2021 11:37:58 - INFO - __main__ - Context: The Dodgers -- Yankees rivalry is a Major League Baseball ( MLB ) rivalry between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees . The Dodgers are a member club of the National League ( NL ) West division , and the Yankees are a member club of the American League ( AL ) East division . The rivalry between the Dodgers and Yankees is one of the most well - known rivalries in Major League Baseball . The two teams have met 11 times in the World Series , more times than any other pair of teams from the American and National Leagues . The initial significance was embodied in the two teams ' proximity in New York City , when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn . After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958 , the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States , and since the 1980s , the two largest cities in the United States . The Dodgers currently lead the regular season series 7 - 6 . Although the rivalry 's significance arose from the two teams ' numerous World Series meetings , the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981 . They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004 , when they played a 3 - game interleague series . Nevertheless , games between the two teams have become quite popular and draw sellout crowds . | Question: when was the last time the dodgers played yankees in the world series ?
