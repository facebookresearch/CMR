They are known for their agility, intelligence, speed, stamina and strength. Amazingly enough, this breed originated in Germany and was bred by a German man named Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann in the 1860s for those purposes. This is of course where the Doberman, also known as Dobes, get their name. Louis wanted to create a guard dog that would protect him as he traveled through dangerous communities filled with thieves. They are a mix between German Pinschers, Beaucerons, Manchester Terriers, Greyhounds and Rottweilers. This very interesting mix of dogs produced a magnificent animal. Not only do they make loyal companions, but they also are great for search and rescue, military and police work, guarding, therapy work and competitive obedience.      So what makes this dog so good at what it does? Well, its body is very muscular. The chest is broad and legs are perfectly straight. Dobes have perfect strides when they run, as their hind legs are in sync with their front legs. This gives them fast capabilities to hunt down their prey. Doberman Pinscher’s heads are long and the tops of their heads are flat. Their sleek head give them advantage in their surroundings. As for their teeth, they meet in a scissor-like bite. Their coats are coarse and can range from black, red, fawn, and even to blue.  An interesting breed fact is that their nose matches the color of the coat. Because their coats are short they can be sensitive to cold weather.  These dogs shed very little, so maintenance is minimal. The Doberman's expectancy of life is 10 to 13 years.       Due to the breed’s ability to comprehend what it learns, the Doberman Pinscher can be a very clever dog. They are smart and relatively easy to train. With such a unique breed, come special requirements as an owner.  Because Dobermans can be stubborn at times, they require a handler who is assertive and confident. Also, early socialization is important in effort to curtail shy and timid-like behavior.      Alike all dogs, the Doberman can be a pleasure to own if cared for properly. A helpful tip when considering this breed is to allow them plenty of physical activity. Dobes need enough space to run and stretch, therefore apartment life isn’t recommended. Common health issues of the breed include bloating, hip dysplasia, minor heart defects and prostatic disease.        Well known owners of the breed are President John F. Kennedy, who’s Doberman was named Moe. Actor William Shatner has owned a handful of Doberman Pinschers over time, their names were Kirk, Morgan, China, Heidi, Paris, Royale, Martika, Sterling, Charity, Bella and Starbuck. Even Mariah Carey flaunted her Doberman, Princess, in her “All I Want For Christmas is You” video.  Famous Doberman Owners - Dobermans Den - TheFamous Doberman Owners  Home > Fun Stuff > Famous Doberman Owners  Famous Doberman Owners  Usually we see celebrities with toy dogs that look more like a fashion accessories than a loved pet. And rarely do we see our beloved Doberman with a celebrity,  photographed by the paparazzi.  But of course, there are some famous people who own Dobermans, (some who have sadly passed away).  I think you’ll find this list interesting and it shows how diverse the people who love Dobermans are. This list is partially taken from Stanley Coren’s book, “Why we love the dogs we do”, as well as various online research. If I missed anyone please let me know in the comments below.  If you’re looking for famous Dobermans from the movies and tv, here’s a fun list of the most famous Dobermans .     Hunter S Thompson  Hunter S Thompson, was a popular American writer who died in 2005.  He had several Dobermans and has included them in his books.  In | Question: Which actor had a Doberman Pinscher called Kirk?

Thank Heaven for Little Girls"Thank Heaven for Little Girls" is a 1957 song written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe and often associated with performer Maurice Chevalier. It opened and closed the 1958 film Gigi. Alfred Drake performed the song in the 1973 Broadway stage production of Gigi, though in the 2015 revival, it was sung as a duet between Victoria Clark and Dee Hoty.  The Chevalier version is often regarded as the definitive version of the song; he recorded it in 1958. In 2004 it finished at #56 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.  In the mid-'90s, a contemporary take on the song was recorded by the Seattle-based alternative band Ruby for a Mountain Dew commercial  in the United States. This recording was later repurposed by PepsiCo for their Pepsi Max brand in the UK.  It has also been performed by Rosemary Clooney, Perry Como, Gérard Depardieu, Merle Haggard, Hugh Hefner, The King Brothers, Ed McMahon, and in his faux French accent, Peter Sellers.
