Find out more: http://sky.com/tv/show/k  Karl Pilkington is best known as the star of Sky1 travel documentary series An Idiot Abroad and The Moaning of Life. Karl is also the author of six best selling books, with his seventh entitled More Moaning, to be released in June 2016.  The Moaning of Life saw Karl set off around the world to experience how other cultures faced up to life’s big issues as he made plans for his future, and it continues to be heralded as one of Sky1’s most popular ever programs. Series 2 was 275% above the slot average with extremely high social media engagement. Series 1 was Sky1’s most successful home-grown show that year with over 2.3 million people watching the first episode alone, as well as generating record On Demand and Sky Go viewing figures for non-scripted programming on Sky. It has now been seen by millions of viewers around the world.  An Idiot Abroad saw Karl being sent around the world by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant on a journey of self discovery. The program spanned three series, culminating in Karl being joined by actor Warwick Davis on an epic journey following the famous explorer Marco Polo from Venice to Eastern Europe, India and China as they got stuck into different cultures and traditions, illuminated by Karl’s trademark observations about the world and Warwick’s varying experiences as a little person in different countries.  The An Idiot Abroad brand has grown from strength to strength. The second series was nominated for a BAFTA® Television Award, adding to previous nods from the British Comedy, National Television, Royal Television Society, Broadcast and Broadcasting Press Guild awards. The series have been sold to over 200 territories worldwide. The accompanying DVDs (distributed by BBC Worldwide) have sold over a million copies and books (published by Canongate) have sold over a million copies in the UK alone, with the first book hitting the Top Ten in hardback in the autumn of 2010 and the No.1 spot on the paperback list in the autumn of 2011. The books have spent 50 weeks in total in the Sunday Times Top 10 bestseller lists. Most recently the accompanying The Moaning of Life book also spent 10 weeks in the Sunday Times best seller list in both hardback and paperback.  The Ricky Gervais Show started out life as a radio programme on London station XFM, which began in 2001 and aired weekly for months at a time during 2002, 2003 and 2004. Karl was an off-air producer for Ricky and Stephen but he didn’t stay off-air for long and his antics and opinions along with his fascination for odd stuff, distrust of animals and dislike of crowds meant that he became a much more vocal part of the show and became the cult hero of the XFM broadcasts.  A series of record-breaking podcasts with Ricky and Stephen followed, making Karl a household name around the world. The podcasts went to number 1 in 14 countries including America and became the most downloaded in history according to Guinness World Records, having gained an average of 261,670 downloads per episode during its first month. The podcasts have remained at the top of the charts, outselling, albums, TV and film, currently having been downloaded over 300 million times.  The podcasts were eventually animated for both HBO in the US and E4 in the UK. US-based producer Media Rights Company (MRC) along with Wildbrain, the animation studio behind YoGabbaGabba, made the show.  Karl’s classic quote, “I could eat a knob at night,” has spawned dance records, merchandise and a thousand online discussions – one such discussion leading to the conclusion that Karl isn’t real but is in fact a comedy character invented by Ricky and Stephen. The real thing was first seen in all his glory in a twenty-minute interview, which appeared on Ricky Gervais’ live stand-up comedy DVD, Politics.

Fast count: A ballot box is rushed into the Silksworth Centre during the 2010 General Election count.  Kevin Clark  Have your say  THE eyes of the nation will be on Wearside tomorrow night, as Sunderland races to produce the first result of the General Election.  The city has been the first to announce in the last five General Election and council chiefs will be hoping to make it six in a row this time.  The prime aim is running an accurate and efficient election count for voters and candidates. If we happen to be first, that’s a bonus.  City council chief executive Dave Smith  Sunderland declared the first three results of the 2010 election, with the counting all wrapped up in barely an hour-and-a-half.  Houghton and Sunderland South’s Bridget Phillipson was the first member of the new Parliament to be announced, with victory confirmed less than an hour after the polls closed.  The first declaration of the evening came at 10.52pm, followed by Washington and Sunderland West’s Sharon Hodgson, whose win was confirmed at 11.25pm, and Sunderland Central, where Julie Elliott’s victory was announced at 11.41pm.  It was the second time in a row Sunderland had declared the first three constituencies nationwide and the fifth General Election in a row  in which the city has been the first to declare a constituency.  City council chief executive Dave Smith said the main aim was to provide an accurate count: “What we’re aiming to do is run an efficient election and declare accurate results as quickly as we can.  “The prime aim is running an accurate and efficient election count for voters and candidates. If we happen to be first, that’s a bonus.  “Many of the counters are council staff and they do this every election year, some are bank staff and there’s a lot of experience. The counters have induction sessions before joining and the city council has lots of experience at these counts, so we’ve honed and improved our techniques over the years.”  Preparations have been under way for months, said Mr Smith.  “There’s a lot of planning and improving on what we’ve done in previous years; so if you get a lot of marginal gains and improvements then these can help improve the bigger picture,” he added.  “Planning for this General Election has been, in a sense, going on for sometime now. Electoral staff have been taking feedback from previous counts, from last year’s local council elections and European election, speaking to other electoral officers across the country, and looking at the guidance that comes from the Electoral Commission.”  Being the leader of the pack means there is huge media interest in the Sunderland count.  Representatives of national press and TV will cram into the Silksworth Sports Complex for tomorrow night’s count, but Dr Smith is confident the team will not be phased by the attention.  “All election counts have their observers,” he said.

These lie in the Central Fells area of the Lake District, and together they make up some of the best known and most photographed peaks in Lakeland. Harrison Stickle stands at an elevation of 736 m (2,415 ft) and a prominence of around 53 m (174 ft), which means it is also classed as a Hewitt and a Nuttall.  Its summit consists of a short, rocky ridge with a cairn standing at each end. From here, hikers can see all the major fell groups lying around and about the peak, with especially fine views down to Great Langdale and Windermere.  Climbing Harrison Stickle  The most commonly used starting point for routes to the summit of Harrison Stickle begins at New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel, Great Langdale. From here, walkers usually pursue a circular route that can take in up to eight of Wainwright’s listed peaks: the three Langdale Pikes, Pavey Ark, Thunacar Knott, High Raise, Sergeant Man and Blea Rigg. This makes for a very full day’s walking and is rewarding in terms of the spectacular views. If you have less time or energy available, the simplest route runs from the same hotel, following Stickle Beck to Stickle Tarn; and then the path leading up the western side of Pavey Ark to the summit of Harrison Stickle.  Landscape: Mountain  Wainwright Walks Pavey Ark - GuideUsWainwright Walks Pavey Ark  Wainwright Walks Pavey Ark  Wainwright Fells Map & Tick List  £9.99  Area: Wainwright Central Fells  Pavey Ark is part of the group of Wainwright Fells that includes the Langdale Pikes, and is sometimes included with Loft Crag, Harrison Stickle and Pike of Stickle in the definition of the Pikes. A Wainwright walk to the top of Pavey Ark is often carried out via a boulder strewn steep path called Jake's Rake, which gets to the summit from Stickle Tarn by way of an awkward, but exhilarating climb that requires use of the arms as well as the legs to getpast. Technically the eastern face of Pavey Ark is actually a cliff, so youknow a Wainwright walk to the summit via Jake's Rake is something of achallenge! However, if scrambling is not your thing, after reaching StickleTarn from the New Dungeon Ghyll in Langdale, easier routes to the top can befound to either side of the craggy cliff face.  If you are intent of completing as many peaks as possible from a map of the Wainwrights, Pavey Ark is a good choice for a Wainwright walk that includes the other Langdale Pikes, with Pavey Ark being the last or first in a round including Pike O'Stickle, Harrison Stickle and Loft Crag, depending on the direction the walk in carried out from the New Dungeon Ghyll. In addition, some Wainwright walkers will also include nearby Thunacar Knott, while the most ambitious can complete a day's Wainwright walking by including Sergeant Man and High Raise (Langdale). This final route has the benefit of completing seven peaks from your Wainwright Maps.  From the top of Pavey Ark, those completing a Wainwright walk will have good views of the southern and eastern fells, together with Stickle Tarn at the bottom of Jake's Rake. The large mass of High Raise is well seen too, though it does block the view to the north so the finest views are to be had facing the opposite direction.  Further information on the Langdale Pikes and Pavey Ark is contained in Book Three: The Central Fells, by A. Wainwright, a volume of the Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.

They are known for their agility, intelligence, speed, stamina and strength. Amazingly enough, this breed originated in Germany and was bred by a German man named Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann in the 1860s for those purposes. This is of course where the Doberman, also known as Dobes, get their name. Louis wanted to create a guard dog that would protect him as he traveled through dangerous communities filled with thieves. They are a mix between German Pinschers, Beaucerons, Manchester Terriers, Greyhounds and Rottweilers. This very interesting mix of dogs produced a magnificent animal. Not only do they make loyal companions, but they also are great for search and rescue, military and police work, guarding, therapy work and competitive obedience.      So what makes this dog so good at what it does? Well, its body is very muscular. The chest is broad and legs are perfectly straight. Dobes have perfect strides when they run, as their hind legs are in sync with their front legs. This gives them fast capabilities to hunt down their prey. Doberman Pinscher’s heads are long and the tops of their heads are flat. Their sleek head give them advantage in their surroundings. As for their teeth, they meet in a scissor-like bite. Their coats are coarse and can range from black, red, fawn, and even to blue.  An interesting breed fact is that their nose matches the color of the coat. Because their coats are short they can be sensitive to cold weather.  These dogs shed very little, so maintenance is minimal. The Doberman's expectancy of life is 10 to 13 years.       Due to the breed’s ability to comprehend what it learns, the Doberman Pinscher can be a very clever dog. They are smart and relatively easy to train. With such a unique breed, come special requirements as an owner.  Because Dobermans can be stubborn at times, they require a handler who is assertive and confident. Also, early socialization is important in effort to curtail shy and timid-like behavior.      Alike all dogs, the Doberman can be a pleasure to own if cared for properly. A helpful tip when considering this breed is to allow them plenty of physical activity. Dobes need enough space to run and stretch, therefore apartment life isn’t recommended. Common health issues of the breed include bloating, hip dysplasia, minor heart defects and prostatic disease.        Well known owners of the breed are President John F. Kennedy, who’s Doberman was named Moe. Actor William Shatner has owned a handful of Doberman Pinschers over time, their names were Kirk, Morgan, China, Heidi, Paris, Royale, Martika, Sterling, Charity, Bella and Starbuck. Even Mariah Carey flaunted her Doberman, Princess, in her “All I Want For Christmas is You” video.

And rarely do we see our beloved Doberman with a celebrity,  photographed by the paparazzi.  But of course, there are some famous people who own Dobermans, (some who have sadly passed away).  I think you’ll find this list interesting and it shows how diverse the people who love Dobermans are. This list is partially taken from Stanley Coren’s book, “Why we love the dogs we do”, as well as various online research. If I missed anyone please let me know in the comments below.

Thank Heaven for Little Girls"Thank Heaven for Little Girls" is a 1957 song written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe and often associated with performer Maurice Chevalier. It opened and closed the 1958 film Gigi. Alfred Drake performed the song in the 1973 Broadway stage production of Gigi, though in the 2015 revival, it was sung as a duet between Victoria Clark and Dee Hoty.  The Chevalier version is often regarded as the definitive version of the song; he recorded it in 1958. In 2004 it finished at #56 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.  In the mid-'90s, a contemporary take on the song was recorded by the Seattle-based alternative band Ruby for a Mountain Dew commercial  in the United States. This recording was later repurposed by PepsiCo for their Pepsi Max brand in the UK.  It has also been performed by Rosemary Clooney, Perry Como, Gérard Depardieu, Merle Haggard, Hugh Hefner, The King Brothers, Ed McMahon, and in his faux French accent, Peter Sellers.

In this period  Australia  was mainly occupied in sending forces to assist the European war and to strengthen  Singapore  and Malaya, our ï¿½forward defenceï¿½ against  Japan  .  However, a major part our activity involved the Empire Air Training Scheme, (EATS) under which various countries of the British Empire were trained as aircrew and sent to participate in the European war.  This involved the provision of a network of bases, which were mainly in the coastal area stretching from just north of  Brisbane  to Adelaide; a few were in south-west Western Australia.  The pace of the militarisation of  Australia  had been steadily increasing since 1934 [10] , but it was only with the realisation of the Japanese threat that a real sense of urgency developed. It was apparent that if a major Japanese attack developed while  Britain  was fully occupied in Europe there would be few British resources available to help  Australia  .  Australia  had inadequate infrastructure and relatively little industry, and enormous efforts were made to remedy these problems.  An unprecedented expansion of  ï¿½s air power was required. The formal proclamation of the  Bankstown  airfield project occurred under the National Security Act on 7 June 1940, The urgency was such work began immediately: the Act permitted construction to begin even before the land had been officially resumed by the government. [11] The estimated cost of acquisition of the land was ₤60,000. [12]  This speed of action was made possible by the enormous power granted to the director of munitions, Essington Lewis. He was exempt from the rules that regulated officers of the Crown, in particular the Public Service Act (1922). He was empowered to acquire compulsorily any materials or building which he needed; he could issue contracts with private firms without calling tenders; he could spend up to ï¿½250,000 on any project without prior approval and he could delegate and revoke responsibilities at will [13] .

Credit: ESA  This is part of a SPACE.com series of articles on the Greatest Moments in Flight, the breakthrough events that paved the way for human spaceflight and its next steps: asteroid mining and bases on the moon and Mars.  The United States and the Soviet Union vigorously competed to push the boundaries of mankind's exploration of space. The Russians scored a victory when they launched a small craft carrying cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin to new heights. His 108-minute flight gave him a permanent place in the history books as the first man in space.  The race to the stars  With the 1957 launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first manmade satellite, the Russians took an early lead in the space race. The next step was to send a human off the planet.  The American plan to send a man into space by 1961 created a deadline that the Russian team worked hard to beat. The development of the Vostok spacecraft became paramount. Prior to Gagarin’s historic flight, the Soviets sent a prototype of his spaceship, along with a life-size dummy called Ivan Ivanovich and a dog called Zvezdochka. With these successes, the vessel was considered ready to take a living, breathing human into space. [ INFOGRAPHIC: How the First Human Spaceflight Worked ]  The right stuff  More than 200 Russian Air Force fighter pilots were selected as cosmonaut candidates. Such pilots were considered optimum because they had exposure to the forces of acceleration and the ejection process, as well as experience with high-stress situations. Among the pilots was 27-year-old Senior Lieutenant Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin.  The third of four children, Gagarin was born on March 9, 1934, in a small village a hundred miles from Moscow. As a teenager, Gagarin witnessed a Russian Yak fighter plane make an emergency landing near his home. When offered a chance years later to join a flying club, he eagerly accepted, making his first solo flight in 1955. Only a few years later, he submitted his request to be considered as a cosmonaut. [ PHOTOS: Yuri Gagarin & 50 Years of Human Spaceflight ]  First in (space) flight  On April 12, 1961, at 9:07 a.m. Moscow time, the Vostok 1 spacecraft blasted off from the Soviets' launch site. Because no one was certain how weightlessness would affect a pilot, the spherical capsule had little in the way of onboard controls; the work was done either automatically or from the ground. If an emergency arose, Gagarin was supposed to receive an override code that would allow him to take manual control, but Sergei Korolov, chief designer of the Soviet space program, disregarded protocol and gave it to the pilot prior to the flight.  Over the course of 108 minutes, Vostok 1 traveled around the Earth once, reaching a maximum height of 203 miles (327 kilometers). Over Africa, the engines fired to bring Gagarin back to Earth. The craft carried ten days worth of provisions in case the engines failed and Gagarin was required to wait for the orbit to naturally decay, but they were unnecessary. Gagarin re-entered Earth's atmosphere, experiencing forces up to eight times the pull of gravity, but remained consciousness.  Vostok 1 had no engines to slow its re-entry or a way to land safely. About four miles up (seven kilometers), Gagarin ejected and parachuted to Earth. In order for the mission to be counted as an official spaceflight, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the governing body for aerospace records, had determined that the pilot must land with the spacecraft. Soviet leaders indicated that Gagarin had touched down with the Vostok 1, and did not reveal that he had ejected until 1971. Regardless, Gagarin still set the record as the | Question: What was the name of the first human spaceflight in which Yuri Gugarin was sent into space in April 1961?

08/15/2021 15:41:36 - INFO - __main__ - Context: MamuciumMamucium, also known as Mancunium, was a fort in the Roman province of Britannia.  The remains of the fort, protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, are in the Castlefield area of Manchester in North West England ().  Founded c. AD 79, Mamucium was garrisoned by a cohort of auxiliary soldiers and guarded the road running from Chester to York. A vicus, or civilian settlement made up of traders and the families of the soldiers, grew outside the fort and was an area of industrial activity.  The site lay in ruins until the Industrial Revolution when Manchester expanded and the fort was levelled to make way for new developments. It was damaged by the construction of the Rochdale Canal and the Great Northern Railway. The site is now part of the regenerated area of warehousing alongside the Rochdale Canal, part of the Castlefield Urban Heritage Park. Reconstructed remains of the fort's gatehouse, granaries, and some buildings from the vicus are on display to the public.  Location  When the Roman fort in Castlefield was built, it was on a naturally defensible sandstone bluff, guarding a nearby crossing over the River Medlock.Gregory (2007), p. 1. The fort was near a junction between at least two Roman roads. It guarded the road between the legionary fortresses of Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) running east to west, as well as the road between Manchester and Bremetennacum (Ribchester) to the north.  In addition, Mamucium may also have overlooked a lesser road running north west to Coccium (Wigan).Gregory (2007), p. 2. The fort was one of a chain of fortifications along the Eboracum to Deva Victrix road, with Castleshaw Roman fort lying 16 mi to the east,  and Condate (Northwich)  to the west. Stamps on tegulae indicate that Mamucium had administrative links not only with Castleshaw, but also with Ardotalia, the nearest fort (12 miles), Slack and Ebchester; all the forts probably got the tegulae from the same place in Grimescar Wood near Huddersfield.   The area around the fort changed greatly in the centuries that followed; the remains are now surrounded by mills built during Industrial Revolution and were further damaged by the subsequent urbanisation of Manchester.  Castlefield is at the south west corner of Manchester city centre and the Rochdale Canal cuts through the southern corner of the fort. Deansgate, which has developed into a busy thoroughfare, passes close to the east of the fort and follows the general line of Roman road to Ribchester and Castlefield.  Name  The name Mamucium is generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brittonic name, either from mamm- ("breast", in reference to a "breast-like hill")   or from mamma ("mother", in reference to a local river goddess). Both meanings are preserved in languages derived from Common Brittonic, mam meaning "breast" in Irish and "mother" in Welsh.   The neuter suffix -ium is used in Latin placenames, particularly those representing Common Brittonic -ion (a genitive suffix denoting "place or city of ~"). The Welsh name for Manchester is ' and presumably derives from the original Brittonic form.  History  Prehistoric  Although there is no evidence of prehistoric settlement, there is evidence of activity in the area. A Neolithic scraper, two Mesolithic flints and a flint flake have been discovered, as well as a shard of late Bronze Age pottery; however these were mostly not found in situ.  Although the area was in the territory of the Celtic tribe Brigantes until the Romans annexed the area, it may have been under the control of the Setantii, a sub-tribe of the Brigantes.   Roman  The fort was built around  79;  it was built as part of the fortifications erected under Gn. Julius Agricola during his campaigns against the Brigantes after the treaty with them failed.  Excavations have demonstrated that the fort had three main phases of construction: one around  79, the second around 160 AD, and the third around 200. The first phase of the fort was built from turf and timber. Mamucium | Question: Mamucium was the Roman name for which English city?

It's... Springfield.  "Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon," Groening revealed in an interview with Smithsonian.com.  "The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show Father Knows Best took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown," he told the magazine.  "When I grew up, I realised it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the US. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, “This will be cool; everyone will think it’s their Springfield.” And they do."  There are more than 500 episodes of The Simpsons, and the show is the longest-running sitcom on American television. But Groening has never before revealed the city on which the fictional Springfield was based - or at least named.  "I don’t want to ruin it for people, you know?" he said in the interview . "Whenever people say it’s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, 'Yup, that’s right.'"  The cartoonist, who also created the long-running science fiction animation Futurama, grew up in Oregon. He named many elements of the show after his own life. His father was named Homer, for instance, and his family lived on Evergreen Terrace - just as the Simpson family do on the cartoon.  "My family lived on a long, windy road on a little dead-end street called Evergreen Terrace," he said. "Also the name of the street the Simpsons live on - and in order to visit any friends I had to walk at least a mile through the woods to get to their house."

Whilst researching one of my favourite scenes from one of my favourite movies, I was scandalised, shocked and outraged to discover that it regularly ranks amongst the most misquoted . Apparently, lesser mortals fail to match Bette Davis’s effortless, defiant and disdainful delivery of All About Eve’s classic line ‘Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy night’. In fact, they dare to replace ‘night’ with ‘ride’. What would Bette think? Well if Margot Channing, her character in the film is anything to go by, she’d probably offer those naïve fools ‘a milkshake’.  But perhaps they should be forgiven. Not to give the line (and Davies’s delivery) less than it’s due, but it sits within a wonderfully accomplished and articulate dialogue, written by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (who also directed the film). Every scene is filled with cutting and witty asides that perfectly capture ‘theatre folk’ and their preoccupations. So, in a film filled with perfection (the critic Richard Schickel once claimed Mankiewicz was “one of the tiny handful of epigrammists that have written for the screen”) – why this particular line and the particular cocktail party scene?  Firstly, this is a key scene within the movie. All the main players are present and correct, and this is the first time the viewer is able to assess how individual motivations and secret agendas fit together. Secondly, it’s Margo’s opportunity to really display just how she feels about Eve Harrington (played by Anne Baxter), timid, shy Eve who wouldn’t say boo to goose but has inserted herself rather too well in Margo’s life. The audience is already aware of Margo’s growing jealousy, but this is the first time it spills over and becomes apparent to the other characters. In the process, Mankiewicz sets up one of the movie’s central themes – the established actress who’s terrified of aging and the fledgling talent who can’t wait to take her place.  At this point it’s definitely Eve we side with, but there’s always a frisson of sympathy for Margo. Those cutting put-downs and her difficult ways mask fear and paranoia – but ironically Davis was never better than in this film. Growing old suited her, as it eventually suits Margo Channing – both just have to realise that it’s an inevitability to be celebrated rather then ignored. Later, Davis recognised that the role was the greatest break at that of her career, that Mankiewicz ‘resurrected me from the dead’. A typically theatrical response from Davis, and one that could have been spoken by Channing herself.  During the cocktail party scene, fork-tongued theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) arrives with yet another youthful, luminous wannabe star, Miss Caswell (Marilyn Monroe). Margo, who has already made it clear DeWitt isn’t her favourite guest (“I distinctly remember, Addison, crossing you off my guest-list. What are you doing here?”) is cool yet Miss Caswell takes it in her stride. Monroe’s role in the film is brief but impactful and, although surrounded by actors with considerably more experience, seems to draw all the attention. In a foreshadowing of the ‘Monroe’ stereotype DeWitt steers her towards a powerful producer. “Go and do yourself some good”, he advises. She acquiesces, asking “Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?”. Margo is left holding Miss Caswell’s opulent fur stole. ‘Amen’, she proclaims, holding her glass in toast.  That bitterness speaks to us all. As Margo will observe later in the film, in a ‘softer’ moment: “There’s one career all females have in common, whether we like it or not. Sooner or later, we’ve got to work at it, no matter how | Question: "Which actress said in the film All About Eve, ""Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night""?" ?

Vitamin A deficiency exists when the chronic failure to eat sufficient amounts of vitamin A or beta-carotene results in levels of blood-serum vitamin A that are below a defined range. Beta-carotene is a form of pre-vitamin A, which is readily converted to vitamin A in the body. Although vitamin A deficiency is found in malnourished, elderly, and chronically sick populations in the United States, it is most prevalent in developing countries.  Vitamin A is critical for vision, bone growth, and normal bodily development.  It also plays an active role in supporting the immune system.  Cause of Vitamin A Deficiency  The major cause of vitamin A deficiency is a diet that includes few animal sources of pre-formed vitamin A. In addition, iron deficiency can negatively affect vitamin A uptake.   Institutionalized children are at particular risk for vitamin A deficiency due to diets low in vitamin A-rich foods.  Symptoms of Vitamin A Deficiency  Night blindness (an abnormal visual adaptation to darkness) is the first symptom of vitamin A deficiency. Prolonged and severe vitamin A deficiency can produce total and irreversible blindness.  Other symptoms include:  Decreased resistance to infections  Diagnosis of Vitamin A Deficiency  The diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and a low level of vitamin A in the blood.  Implications of Vitamin A Deficiency  Night blindness is one of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency contributes to blindness by making the cornea very dry and damaging the retina and cornea. Approximately 250,000 to 500,000 malnourished children in the developing world go blind each year from a deficiency of vitamin A, approximately half of whom die within a year of becoming blind.  Vitamin A deficiency also diminishes the ability to fight infections and can cause children to die from otherwise non-life threatening illnesses. In countries where children are not immunized, infectious disease like measles have relatively higher fatality rates. Even mild deficiency can be a problem, as it may increase children’s risk of developing respiratory and diarrheal infections, decrease growth rate, slow bone development, and decrease likelihood of survival from serious illness.  Treatment of Vitamin A Deficiency  The night blindness associated with vitamin A deficiency can be reversed with treatment.  Total blindness, however, cannot be treated.  Treatment of vitamin A deficiency can be administered in both oral and injectable forms.  Food fortification is also useful for improving vitamin A deficiency in large populations.  Dietary diversification can also control vitamin A deficiency. The increase in consumption of vitamin A-rich foods of animal origin in addition to fruits and vegetables has beneficial effects on vitamin A deficiency.  It is critical to follow your health care practitioner’s recommendations for vitamin A supplementation, as over-consumption can be toxic.  Food Sources of Vitamin A  The best sources of vitamin A are eggs, milk, butter, liver, and fish, such as herring, sardines, and tuna. Plants do not contain vitamin A, but they do contain beta-carotene and other carotenoids which are converted to vitamin A in the body. The best sources of beta-carotene are dark-green, orange, and yellow fruits and vegetables such as spinach, carrots, oranges, and sweet potatoes.  135 SE Main St, Suite 201, Portland, OR 97214  What Vitamin Deficiency Can Cause Night Blindness - Doctor ...What Vitamin Deficiency Can Cause Night Blindness - Doctor insights on HealthTap  Dr. Yale Kanter Dr. Kanter  1 doctor agreed:  Night blindness: True night blindness or nyctalopia (from greek ????-, nykt- "night"; and ?????, alaos "blindness")  is a condition making it difficult or impossible to see in relatively low light.

08/15/2021 15:41:37 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Greek Mythology - Ancient History - HISTORY.comGreek Mythology - Ancient History - HISTORY.com  Greek Mythology  A+E Networks  Introduction  “Myth has two main functions,” the poet and scholar Robert Graves wrote in 1955. “The first is to answer the sort of awkward questions that children ask, such as ‘Who made the world? How will it end? Who was the first man? Where do souls go after death?’…The second function of myth is to justify an existing social system and account for traditional rites and customs.” In ancient Greece, stories about gods and goddesses and heroes and monsters were an important part of everyday life. They explained everything from religious rituals to the weather, and they gave meaning to the world people saw around them.  Google  Greek Mythology: Sources  In Greek mythology, there is no single original text like the Christian Bible or the Hindu Vedas that introduces all of the myths’ characters and stories. Instead, the earliest Greek myths were part of an oral tradition that began in the Bronze Age, and their plots and themes unfolded gradually in the written literature of the archaic and classical periods. The poet Homer’s 8th-century BC epics the Iliad and the Odyssey, for example, tell the story of the (mythical) Trojan War as a divine conflict as well as a human one. They do not, however, bother to introduce the gods and goddesses who are their main characters, since readers and listeners would already have been familiar with them.  Did You Know?  Many consumer products get their names from Greek mythology. Nike sneakers are the namesake of the goddess of victory, for example, and the website Amazon.com is named after the race of mythical female warriors. Many high school, college and professional sports teams (Titans, Spartans and Trojans, for instance) also get their names from mythological sources.  Around 700 BC, the poet Hesiod’s Theogony offered the first written cosmogony, or origin story, of Greek mythology. The Theogony tells the story of the universe’s journey from nothingness (Chaos, a primeval void) to being, and details an elaborate family tree of elements, gods and goddesses who evolved from Chaos and descended from Gaia (Earth), Ouranos (Sky), Pontos (Sea) and Tartaros (the Underworld).  Later Greek writers and artists used and elaborated upon these sources in their own work. For instance, mythological figures and events appear in the 5th-century plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides and the lyric poems of Pindar. Writers such as the 2nd-century BC Greek mythographer Apollodorus of Athens and the 1st-century BC Roman historian Gaius Julius Hyginus compiled the ancient myths and legends for contemporary audiences.  Greek Mythology: The Olympians  At the center of Greek mythology is the pantheon of deities who were said to live on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. From their perch, they ruled every aspect of human life. Olympian gods and goddesses looked like men and women (though they could change themselves into animals and other things) and were–as many myths recounted–vulnerable to human foibles and passions.  The twelve main Olympians are:  Zeus (Jupiter, in Roman mythology): the king of all the gods (and father to many) and god of weather, law and fate  Hera (Juno): the queen of the gods and goddess of women and marriage  Aphrodite (Venus): goddess of beauty and love  Apollo (Apollo): god of prophesy, music and poetry and knowledge  Ares (Mars): god of war  Artemis (Diana): goddess of hunting, animals and childbirth  Athena (Minerva): goddess of wisdom and defense  Demeter (Ceres): goddess of agriculture and grain  Dionysos (Bacchus): god of wine, pleasure and festivity  Hephaistos (Vulcan): god of fire, metalworking and sculpture  Hermes (Mercury): god of travel, hospitality and trade and Zeus’s personal messenger  Poseidon (Neptune): god of the sea  Other gods and goddesses sometimes included in the roster of Olympians are: | Question: Who was the Greek Queen of the Gods?

Here is a brief history:   The first canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas via the Nile River was dug in 1874 B.C. during the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Senausret III. It was abandoned and reopened several times over the subsequent 2,500 years.   Pharonic inscriptions showed that Egyptians used the canals to move warships, send pilgrimages to the Holy Land and transport grain and stones used in ancient monuments.   Napoleon sought to build a modern canal in order to undermine Britain's control of trading routes to Asia, but he abandoned the project after engineers wrongly determined that a difference in water levels would cause the Mediterranean to be inundated.   French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps and Egyptian viceroy Said Pasha developed the current Suez Canal in the mid-19th century. French and Egyptian private interests controlled the company entrusted with building and running the canal, though Britain later acquired Egypt's share.   Completion of the 163-kilometre (101 mile) waterway took 10 years of intense and generally poorly-paid work by Egyptians who were drafted at the rate of 20,000 every 10 months from "the peasantry."   The canal, which was opened for navigation on Nov. 17, 1869, cut weeks if not months off journeys between Europe and Asia that otherwise necessitated a trip around Africa. Numerous heads of state visited Egypt for weeks of celebrations.   In 1956, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the canal, leading to a failed invasion by Britain, which controlled the channel, as well as France and Israel. The waterway was closed briefly until 1957 and the again for eight years following the 1967 war with Israel.   President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced on Tuesday that Egypt would build a new channel as part of a larger project to expand port and shipping facilities around the canal in an effort to establish Egypt as a major trade hub.  Primary Source: Suez Canal Authority  Suez Canal, Egypt | Building the WorldSuez Canal, Egypt | Building the World  Building the World  Entrance to Port Said on the Suez Canal circa 1856, from Library of Congress, at loc.gov.  WHY EGYPT?  The Middle East is one of the most important regions in the world. Land of the ancient pyramids, home of the mighty Nile, Egypt’s Suez Canal transformed shipping as far away as Singapore . Egypt is critical to the future of the region and the world, and so is the Suez Canal.  PHARAOH’S DREAM OR CALIPH’S NIGHTMARE?  The waterway, perhaps initiated by the legendary Pharaoh Sesostris, was navigated by Egyptians during Seti I in 1380 B.C. The ancient channel – still visible in areas near Wadi Tumilat and actually used by constructors of the Suez Canal – did not connect all the way to the Red Sea; at the time of Darius, 520 B.C., ships entering from the Mediterranean traversed the Pelusiac section of the Nile to Bubastis, where they continued to Heropolis. But there was a break at that point; all cargo had to be reloaded onto ships on the Red Sea. It was good business for transfer specialists but not for shippers.  In 385 B.C., Ptolemy Philadelphus finally connected the canal to the Red Sea, building a new town called Arsinoe at the juncture. But the waterway proved only too strategic and was ordered closed in 770 A.D. by the Caliph al-Mansur, founder of Baghdad , to cut off the supply route being used by his enemies.  CHILDHOOD FRIENDSHIP  Ferdinand de Lesseps, from bbc.co.uk.  If war closed the earlier canal, diplomacy and friendship eventually opened it to the world.

08/15/2021 15:41:37 - INFO - __main__ - Context: BesomBesom is a dialectal or historical word for what is now known as a broom, a household implement used for sweeping.   The term "besom" is now mostly reserved for a "traditionally constructed" broom, made from a bundle of twigs tied to  a stouter pole.   The twigs used could be broom (i.e. Genista, whence the modern name "broom" for the tool), heather or similar.  The song "Buy Broom Buzzems" from Northern England refers to both types of twig.  From the phrase broom besom the more common broom comes.  Description  As a result of its construction around a central pole, the brush of the besom is rounded instead of flat. The bristles can be made of many materials including, but not limited to straw, herbs, or twigs. Traditionally the handle is of hazel wood and the head is of birch twigs. Modern construction uses bindings of wire and string (instead of the traditional split withy) and the head is secured by a steel nail instead of a wooden dowel.  In Wicca  A besom is a tool used in Wicca to cleanse and purify a space which will be used for ritual. A traditional Wiccan besom is a hawthorn stave handle with bristles made from birch twigs. These twigs are tied on using thin pieces of willow wood. It is used to cleanse the ritual area before circle casting. While it does not usually touch the ground, it is used to "sweep out" the negative energies in a room, and is often held a few inches above the ground to do so. As a tool, the besom is usually thought of as masculine in nature due to its phallic shape and symbolism. However the besom's components are of both masculine and feminine orientation.   The handle, an ash stave, is masculine in nature while the birch used for the bristles is thought of as feminine in nature.  The besom is thought to be involved with fairies.  The besom is an important part of Wiccan handfasting ceremonies in some traditions. The couple jump over the besom during the ceremony. Alternatively, the couple may jump over a small bonfire.  Other meanings  In Scotland, "besom" (pronounced "bih-zum") may be used to refer to a particularly annoying person or naughty child.  The Witch’s Besom – The Modern PaganThe Witch’s Besom – The Modern Pagan   •  4 Comments  By Lyon Mercaeant  Samhain is right around the corner and along with that of course, is also the secular Halloween.  One of the most popular icons of the holiday is the old witchy hag, with her warty nose, trendy buckled boots (Hey – if you hold onto anything long enough it will come back into style again!), and what item is this green skinned diva never seen without?  Her broom, or more accurately termed, her besom.  Regardless of the fictional portrayal of witches in the mainstream seasonal iconography, the besom is actually a tool used within the modern practice of witchcraft, and it is an item that is fun but also steeped in quite a bit of symbolic lore and tradition.  I am going to explore some of this symbolism, as well as discuss its uses and ideas for their creation.  I will also leave you with some resources for learning how to create your very own besoms.  The besom, while being a standard in housekeeping practices since ages long past, is actually quite more than just domestic armament.  Magically speaking, it is a symbol of fertility and sexuality.  Many sources cite the traditional construction of besoms as having a handle made of ash, a head made of birch twigs, with bindings made of willow.  The ash according to Scott Cunningham is a wood associated with masculinity, fire and amorous love.  The birch is a wood associated with femininity, protection and cleansing.  The besom takes the two and becomes a symbol of their uniting as one.  You can make the implied leaps in imagery required here I’m sure.  This is one of the reasons why the besom is traditionally | Question: What is a besom used to do?

IN THESE GROUPS  Rags to Riches  Mark Wahlberg - Mini Biography (TV-PG; 3:10) Actor Mark Wahlberg first gained recognition as the frontman for Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and as a model for Calvin Klein. His long list of acting credits includes the films "The Departed," and "Boogie Nights."  Synopsis  Born on June 5, 1971, in Dorchester, Mass., Mark Wahlberg grew up the youngest of nine children. After a 45-day jail term at 16, Wahlberg turned his life around via the music world with the help of his brother Donnie, a member of New Kids on the Block. Wahlberg transformed from rapper to Hollywood actor and never looked back, starring in films such as Boogie Nights and Three Kings. His recent projects include Lone Survivor (2013), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) and Ted 2 (2015).  On the Streets of Boston  Actor and former rapper Mark Wahlberg was born on June 5, 1971, in Dorchester,  Massachusetts. Wahlberg grew up the youngest of nine children in a  working class Irish Catholic family in the Boston district of  Dorchester. Wahlberg's parents divorced when he was 11; his mother  has since blamed her own emotional neglect for her youngest son's  descent into juvenile delinquency during the next several years.  At 14,  Wahlberg dropped out of school and began making his living on the  streets—hustling, stealing, and selling drugs. Two years later, he  hit rock bottom when he was jailed for his role in the savage beating of  a Vietnamese man. Although the crime was believed by many to be  racially motivated, Wahlberg has continually denied that race played a  part in the attack. His 45-day stint in prison was a self-proclaimed  turning point in the 16-year-old Wahlberg's life. Vowing to give himself  some direction in his life, he also began body building seriously,  chiseling his body into impressive form.  Pop Star Fame  By the time  Wahlberg had emerged from prison, his older brother Donnie had rocketed to  stardom as one of five fresh-faced members of the pop band New Kids on  the Block. Donnie decided to help his younger brother find his own niche  in the music business. What Wahlberg lacked in singing ability, he made  up for in charisma and good looks—with Donnie's hip-hop arrangements  and producing help, Marky Mark (his rap name) and his back-up deejay  and dancers (dubbed "the Funky Bunch") recorded a debut album, Music for  the People (1991). Driven by the success of the hit dance singles "Good  Vibrations" and "Wildside" (and by Marky Mark's readiness to discard  his shirt and drop his pants onstage and in his videos), the album went  platinum, selling over a million copies.  One of pop  music's hottest new commodities, Wahlberg (and his rock-hard physique)  became even more ubiquitous when he signed a two-year contract with the  designer Calvin Klein to model underwear. His raucous public persona, he  once became involved in a much-talked-about brawl with Madonna and her  entourage at a Los Angeles nightclub only served to increase his popular  appeal, until news began surfacing about his criminal past and his  possibly racist and homophobic tendencies.  In 1993, this  part of Wahlberg's personal life was seriously questioned when he was  accused of condoning blatantly homophobic remarks made on a British talk  show by his fellow guest, the reggae singer Shabba Ranks. Combined with  the disappointing sales of the Funky Bunch's second album, You Gotta  Believe (1992), the public criticism of Wahlberg's career seemed to be  steering his career towards certain | Question: What is Mark Wahlberg's home town?

A:  Quick Answer  An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. An icosahedron has 30 edges and 12 vertices. Five equilateral triangles meet at each vertex.  Full Answer  An icosahedron is an example of a Platonic solid, which is a polyhedron that is regular, convex, made of congruent faces of regular polygons, and has the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. Only five known shapes meet this criteria.  The other Platonic solids include the tetrahedron with four triangular faces, the cube, or hexahedron, with six square faces, the octahedron with eight triangular faces and the dodecahedron with twelve pentagonal faces.  Solid shapes and their nets - icosahedronSolid shapes and their nets - icosahedron  Icosahedron  Other regular solids with triangular faces?  Description of an icosahedron  A tetrahedron is made of triangles with three triangles at each point. An octahedron has four triangles at each point. Can we fit five triangles at each point? Yes, we can, and it's called an icosahedron. It has 20 faces.  There are 43380 distinct nets for the icosahedron, so I don't expect you to find them all! An icosahedron can be thought of as ten triangles going round the 'equator', with five at the 'north pole' and five at the 'south pole'. Thinking of this helps us to work out a net.  Model of an icosahedron  This model (right) was made from a kit with magnetic connections. Since it just shows the edges, you can see through the model, which means that you can count the vertices and edges easier. Unfortunately, since the icosahedron is quite complicated, one edge and one vertex(corner) is hidden, several more are hard to make out, and the shadows don't help! Still, you can guess, or perhaps you can make up your own model to count from. How many vertices (corners) and edges are there? See Euler's formula .  Net of an icosahedron  Here is one net for an icosahedron. Print it out, stick it on thin card, score along the lines and fold them, form the shape, then stick it together with small amounts of glue.  For more details, see the notes for the net of a cube .  Colour scheme for model  You might like to think of a colour scheme for your finished shape. It's a lot easier if you colour it in before you stick it together, or even before you cut it out. Try to imagine what the finished shape will look like when colouring it in. You could try to draw lines that run over edges. That's easy if the faces are together in the net, less easy if there are gaps! Do you want straight lines or curvy ones? Can you draw a line which will end up going right round the shape? How about colouring all the bits near a point in the same colour? You could paint the 'equator' one colour, and the two 'poles' another. There are diamonds on the finished surface - try finding them and painting them. An icosahedron is fairly close to a sphere, so if you are really ambitious, you could try drawing the world on it.  Then when you stick it together, you can see if your shape's design looks anything like you imagined it would!  Viruses  Many viruses have the shape of an icosahedron. This is a common cold virus, with the icosahedron drawn on.

Robert Davids  The public accent on youth in recent years has had little effect upon major league baseball.  Clubs have been restricted from signing young stars until they are out of high school, and this reduces the ranks of fuzzy-faced youngsters on Big League rosters.  The youngest player in 1972, for example, was Rowland Office, outfielder for Atlanta, who played in two games about 2-1/2 months before his 20th birthday on October 25.  This is enough to make Joe Nuxhall turn cartwheels in his broadcast booth.  Nuxhall, you may recall, was only 15 when he made his debut with the Reds in 1944.  The contribution of teenagers to major league baseball has been somewhat limited over the years, although there have been more than 25 who made their playing debuts at 17, and about a half-dozen who broke in at 16.  That doesn’t mean that they really took hold at that age, however.  The question comes up, for example, was there a hurler who won 20 games in a season prior to his 20th birthday?  We have a recent example of Wally Bunker winning 19 for Baltimore in 1964 when he was 19.  And bob Feller won 17 for the Indians in 1939 when he was 19.  However, it looks like long-forgotten Jake Weimer was the only one to do it in this century.  He won 21 for the Cubs in 1903 when he was 19, and then to prove it was no fluke, he won 20 the next year.  But he seemed to be going down hill, as he faded to 18 in 1905.  Going back before 1900, there were a number of outstanding young hurlers who carried a man-sized load prior to their 20th birthday.  Hard-throwing Amos Rusie made his debut with Indianapolis of the NL in 1889 when he was still 17, and the next year when he was 18-19 years old, he won 29 games for the Giants.  Hall of Famer Monte Ward started off big in 1878 with Providence when he won 22 games as an 18-year-old.  The next year he pitched Providence to the pennant with 47 victories, and by the time he celebrated his 21st birthday, he had won 107 major league games.  Of course, his arm was then about shot and he soon had to shift to the infield.  The youngest of the young hurlers in the 19th century was probably Wee Willie McGill, a gifted lefthander picked off the Chicago sandlots by Cleveland of the Players League in 1890.  Although his precise age was not publicized at the time, he was only 16 years and six months when he started a game against Buffalo at Cleveland on May 8.  He was not only very young, but very short, about 5-1/2 feet tall, and his prospects did not look very good.  But, this is what the writer of the Buffalo Express had to say:  “A young man named McGill, a regular Davy Force sort of ballplayers (very short), was in the box for Cleveland.  He is like the little girl’s definition of a sugar plumb, round and rosy and sweet all over, and he throws barrel hoops and corkscrews at the plate.  Once in a while he varies these with a swift, straight ball that is as full of starch as though it had just come from the laundry.”  McGill, backed by such Cleveland stars as Ed Delahanty and Pete Browning, defeated Buffalo 14-5 in a complete game victory.  He gave up 7 hits and 7 walks, but fanned 10.  He had little trouble with the Buffalo Squad, which included such stars ad Dummy Hoy, Connie Mack, and Deacon White, who, at 42, was the oldest player then active in the majors.  McGill collected a single himself, and knocked in a run.  The young hurler, called Kid or Baby, did not travel with the Brotherhood team | Question: Who was the youngest player to appear in a major league game in the modern era, pitching 2/3 of an inning for the Cincinnati Reds against the St. Louis Cardinals in 1944 when not quite 16 years old?

Also, a series of toys under her name were produced by Mattel.  She is the alter ego of Princess Adora and the twin sister of Prince Adam/He-Man.  She-Ra was intended to appeal to young girls in the same way that He-Man appealed to young boys.   Filmation writer Larry DiTillio created the backstory for the property.   She-Ra is introduced in the animated movie The Secret of the Sword as Force Captain Adora, a member of the Evil Horde that rules the planet Etheria. Princess Adora discovers that she is the long lost twin sister of Prince Adam of Eternia, having been kidnapped as a baby by the Horde's leader Hordak. She is granted the Sword of Protection, which parallels He-Man's Sword of Power, gaining the power to transform into She-Ra, her secret identity.   Fictional character biography  King Randor and Queen Marlena from planet Eternia, had twins, a girl and a boy named Adora and Adam. Hordak, leader of the Evil Horde, kidnapped Adora and escaped to Etheria, where Adora was raised as a mind-controlled Force Captain of The Horde.  Adora's uniform – which she continued to wear throughout the series, even after defecting to the Rebels – consisted of a red tunic over a white long sleeved shirt, matching red boots and gauntlets, and a pair of red shorts with a black belt.   The Sorceress sent Adam and Cringer to the planet Etheria to give the sword the Sorceress gave him to Adora.  The Sorceress reveals to Adora that she was kidnapped by The Horde when she was a baby and that she had a twin brother. By repeating "For the honor of Grayskull" she is transformed into the heroine; She-Ra. She releases He-Man and jumps from a window, crashing into the Horde stables, landing atop Spirit who is transformed into Swift Wind, a winged talking unicorn.  They fly ahead to warn The Rebellion.  He-Man and She-Ra return to Eternia, but she decides she must return to Etheria so that she can help free the planet from the Horde oppression.   Adora, having been trained by the Horde her entire life, assumes leadership of the Great Rebellion. The epic battle to free Etheria from the grip of the Evil Horde rages on, spreading across the corners of the planet. Through this war, She-Ra calls upon her allies across the globe, using their special talents to battle against Horde creations.  Whether or not She-Ra and her forces were ever successful in defeating the Horde was never revealed. Unlike Adam, who often feigned laziness and a carefree attitude to deflect any suspicion that he may be He-Man, Adora never acted against her nature and was always seen as brave and selfless, willing to help others in need at a moment's notice.   When Adora transforms to She-Ra, two castles are shown in the background.  The first is Castle Grayskull.  The second is the Crystal Castle.  The Crystal Castle is located at the top of Skydancer Mountain and is overseen by an entity called Light Hope, who advises She-Ra in times of crisis.  In the Princess of Power toyline, the castle is also protected by two winged crystal horses, Moonbeam and Sun Dancer. It should be noted that the Crystal Castle's location is known only to Ahgo (King of the Trolls), She-Ra, and He-Man (she brought him there one time); She-Ra has sworn to secrecy its location, thus earning the title of "Defender of the Crystal Castle."
