{"input": "Context: James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators . His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' .

This is only partly true ; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day . In 1975 and 1977 , at the behest of then - Commissioner Pete Rozelle , the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team ( Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976 ) . Although the Cardinals , at the time known as the `` Cardiac Cards '' due to their propensity for winning very close games , were a modest success at the time , they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys , who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era . This , combined with St. Louis 's consistently weak attendance , a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three - game stretch , and opposition from the Kirkwood -- Webster Groves Turkey Day Game ( a local high school football contest ) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978 ; it was then , after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games , that the Cowboys requested ( and received ) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever . | Question: when did the cowboys start playing on thanksgiving day ?", "truth": ["1966"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6315", "mistake": "1966", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}
