{"input": "Context: Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year .

{"input": "Context: A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone . It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms , pain , and hyperreflexia . The term `` muscle relaxant '' is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups : neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics . Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system ( CNS ) activity . They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis . Spasmolytics , also known as `` centrally acting '' muscle relaxants , are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions . While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants , the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only . | Question: when are centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants used ?", "truth": ["to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-2563", "mistake": "to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}}

Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments . '' Hutcheson , however , placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights , declaring that `` there can be no Right , or Limitation of Right , inconsistent with , or opposite to the greatest publick Good . '' Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his A System of Moral Philosophy ( 1755 ) , based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience . One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment ( e.g. , about religious questions ) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is `` unalienable . '' Hutcheson wrote : `` Thus no man can really change his sentiments , judgments , and inward affections , at the pleasure of another ; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart .
