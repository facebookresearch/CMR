Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ("Context: BBC - Radio 3 - Elgar/Enigma VariationsBBC - Radio 3 - Elgar/Enigma Variations  13 * * * (Romanza)  14 Finale: E. D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ("Context: Steve Carell as Felonious Gru , the former villain turned Anti-Villain League agent , Margo , Edith , and Agnes ' adoptive father , and Lucy 's husband .

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: What is a Mulligan in Golf? - About.com SportsWhat is a Mulligan in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand. It sits behind a goal, with the family stand to the right, main stand to the left, and the kop directly opposite.

Sir Gordon Richards (5 May 1904 – 10 November 1986) was one of the England’s finest jockeys, often considered the world’s greatest ever jockey. He is still the only jockey to have been knighted. Gordon Richard was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times. He amassed a total of 4,870 winners, and a record 12 consecutive winners ridden. In 1999, the Racing Post (leading racing newspaper in Britain) placed him at number 1 in their list of the top 50 jockeys of 20th century.  Lester Piggott (born 5 November 1935) – is a retired professional jockey and one of the most successful English flat racing jockeys of all time. Nicknamed “The Long Fellow” to his height, Lester Piggott introduced a new style of race-riding that was adopted all over the world and enabled him to become Champion Jockey eleven times. Piggott boasts 4,493 career wins including 30 British classics.  William Lee “Bill” Shoemaker (August 19, 1931 – October 12, 2003) is one of the all-time legends who have graced the sport. Referred to as “The Shoe”, he held the world record of number of professional jockey victories for 29 years. Shoemaker used his small size (1.50 m) to his advantage riding 8,833 winners. A high school dropout, Shoemaker went to ride a total of 40,350 races, and win the United States Champion Jockey by earnings , a record 10 times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1958.  Russell Avery Braze (born 7 August 1958) is the record holder of the most race wins in North American horse racing history . He’s victory counter stopped at the astonishing 12,007 number. Baze won 400 or more races per year for four consecutive years and got rewarded with a special Eclipse Award in 1995. Since then he has on over 400 races a year seven additional times; an achievement that no other jockey has accomplished more than three times. Russell Baze was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. He also received the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 2002.  Julieann Louise “Julie” Krone (born July 24, 1963) is one of the most successful female jockeys in North American horse racing history. Julie became the first female to win a Triple Crown Race when she claimed the Belmont Stakes, riding on Colonial Affair. She sustained number of severe injuries while racing, but always came back stronger. Because of her never give up attitude, Krone was named by USA Today as one of the 10 Toughest Athletes and was honored with the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award by the Women’s Sports Foundation. In 2000 she became the first woman inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

The term "Imperialism" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of "imperialism" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of "imperialism". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power. | Question: What was the idealized value of imperialism?', ['idealism and philanthropy', 'philanthropy'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10015'), ('Context: TurbineA turbine (from the Latin turbo, a vortex, related to the Greek , tyrbē, meaning "turbulence"),   is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ("Context: 2016 Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup  The 2016 Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup was the fourth season following on from the demise of the SRO Group's FIA GT1 World Championship (an auto racing series for grand tourer cars), the third with the designation of Blancpain Sprint Series or Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup.

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ('Context: The industry called Nollywood - Vanguard NewsThe industry called Nollywood - Vanguard News  Vanguard News  A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etc  Search for:  Home » Special Report » The industry called Nollywood  The industry called Nollywood  9:58 pmIn Special Report by adekunle Comments  By McPhilips Nwachukwu  IN the beginning: The story of Nigeria’s Nollywood is like Ben Okri’s “river” in his novel, The Famished Road, “which becomes a road and branches out to the world.”  Like a river, which starts small from a tiny tributary, the industry began as a small effort by some persons with energetic entrepreneurial spirit, who wanted to do small budget films for commercial purposes; and suddenly branched out like an ocean into one huge market that today intersects the world of business interests of actors and actresses, script writers, production crews, distributors and regulatory bodies, even in the daunting face of threatening copyright infringement challenges.  Berthing in Nigeria in 1992, this entertainment industry popularly known as Nollywood is acclaimed by industry players to rank as the third largest movie industry in the world after India’s Bollywood and America’s Nollywood. According to movie scholars and critics, Nollywood industry, which despite its relative young emergence in the global movie market has successfully become an enviable artistic cultural vehicle with which African narrative is communicated to the world, ironically emerged as a child of necessity to fill the gap created by the total collapse of the country’s theatre and stage culture.  According to industry sources, the failure of government in providing adequate security surveillance over life and property in the late 80s’and early 90s’resulted in the very negative manner at which the public viewed public shows, especially as it had to do with cinema, stage and theatrical performances with disenchantment.  Video filmartistes at a film shooting site  Also added to this ugly development “was the fact that there were inadequate television stations across the country with enough entertainment contents to satisfy the yearning needs of the viewing public, a development that led\xa0content providers to seek alternative.”  “Nollywood was a child of necessity” says Professor Ahmed Yerima, theatre artiste and former Artistic Director of The National Troupe of Nigeria. He said: “There were very few television stations and we got to a point where the TV stations that existed needed you, the producer, to get sponsorship for your productions.”  Movie-theatre going culture  But for Obby Patrick Ebewo, Nigerian born and American based film scholar, “The collapse of movie-theatre going culture in the 1980s caused by incessant harassment of innocent citizen by criminals, the country’s economic downturn and various problems affecting celluloid film production, gave rise to video film.”  The implication of this new development, according to Yerima, was that fast thinking and business minded entrepreneurs cashed into the opportunity provided by this yearning need; and aided with the arrival of VHS tapes embarked on a business trial and experimentation that was to transform the continent’s entertainment turf.  Prior to this boom, efforts had been made by some dramatists to evolve a film culture in Nigeria. It is on record that as early as the 1960s’ theatre artistes in the mould of Hubert Ogunde, had recorded his plays on celluloid. Other artistes like Moses Adejumo and Duro Ladipo had equally attempted to reduce the cinematic art of film to a more popular medium for social commentary.  In an effort to trace the emergence of Nollywood and the entire film culture in the country, Ebewo argues that “the current video film industry in Nigeria owes a huge debt to the pioneering efforts of Nigerian theatre, particularly practitioners of the Yoruba Travelling theatre, who branched off from mainstream theatre to experiment with celluloid.”  However, the Nollywood brand today owes its projection and commercial resourcefulness to Kenneth Nnebue, who according to market consensus, pioneered the raving popular media brand with his movie, Living in Bondage, in 1992.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

Anyone who reads or plans to attend a performance of Sunday in the Park With George by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine should first spend some time looking at an image of the this painting by Georges Seurat :\xa0 Its original French title is Un dimanche après-midi à l\'Île de la Grande Jatte – English translation: “ Sunday Afternoon on the Island of la Grande Jatte .” (Click on the painting title to view the online image.)  The first act of Sunday in the Park With George occurs with Seurat the artist creating and perfecting his painting. The creative musical theatre artists who were inspired by this painting drew the other characters in Act One from figures in the painting.  Looking Closely at Art  It would not be surprising to learn that Sondheim and Lapine used their own version of Visual Thinking Strategies to examine this painting that is 10 feet wide and 6 and a half feet tall.

What’s Going On? According to Sondheim and Lapine  The painting’s setting is the island of la Grande Jatte, which is located northwest of Paris in the Seine River. In 1884 (when Seurat began working on his painting), the island was a pastoral place where people could go to get away from city life.

Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, "I shall never take a wife, as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic."

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] | Question: What is another term for rotors?", ['rotating discs'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3467'), ("Context: BLACK DOG: Mitchell - now it's snobgate | Daily Mail OnlineBLACK DOG: Mitchell - now it's snobgate | Daily Mail Online  BLACK DOG: Mitchell - now it's snobgate  comments  As revealed in these columns before his downfall in the 'Plebgate' scandal, Tory MP Andrew Mitchell was known as 'Thrasher' in his days as head boy of Rugby School.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.  Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become \'\'a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,\'\' the Prince said, \'\'I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.\'\' But then he added, \'\'Look, if a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which | Question: "Who famously said after the \'Dunblane Massacre\', ""If a cricketer for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats""?" ?', ['duke of edinburgh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6259'), ("Context: Carbon dioxide ( CO ) - Because of its role as a greenhouse gas it has been described as `` the leading pollutant '' and `` the worst climate pollution '' .

Now, the 1984 romantic comedy is getting a remake – this time with a twist.  Producer Brain Grazer admitted during an interview with CNBC that a remake of “Splash”; was in the works. While Grazer kept mostly mum on the details, he revealed that this version of the story would be told from the mermaid’s perspective.  RELATED: John Stamos Singing “Under The Sea’ From “The Little Mermaid’ Is The Best Way To Start Your Weekend  The original film saw an unlucky-in-love Tom Hanks fall in love with a beautiful mermaid, played by Daryl Hannah, after she rescues him from drowning. Directed by Ron Howard, the film was a commercial and critical success, earning an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  Simply titled “Wet”;, there’s no word on if the film’s original stars will appear in the sequel, but Grazer did share at least one big name could be attached to the project.  “There’s a movie star involved, or going to be involved,”; Grazer said during the interview. “I haven’t announced it.”;  RELATED: Casting Call: Stars Nab A New Role Gallery  “Wet”;”s mermaid star would certainly be at home on land or sea.

Movie Review - - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE ...Movie Review -    - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE - NYTimes.com  SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE  By JANET MASLIN  Published: March     9, 1984  THOUGH Ron Howard's comedies don't adhere to any familiar formulas - Mr. Howard's funny ''Night Shift'' was about a prostitution ring operating out of a morgue, and his even more disarming new ''Splash'' is about a mermaid in Manhattan - they have a comfortably old-fashioned flavor. ''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

I was going on memory. I looked it up, and I can only find it as a Germanic root, but it may go back to PIE as well. This is from Wikipedia:  "The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner," and as such is related to the names of several other European regions where Germanic peoples came into contact with indigenous non-Germanic cultures, including: Wallonia (Belgium), Valais (Switzerland), and Wallachia (Romania), as well as the "-wall" of Cornwall and even the "wal-" in the walnut tree. However, it has also been suggested that the prefix "Wall" acknowledges a people who had contact with the Roman empire (see Vlach)."  Damian in Edinburgh \xa0 Tue Nov 06, 2007 9:18 am GMT  ***"The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner,"***  Ironically is indeed the operative word here.   As far as the English, particularly, are concerned, the Welsh people have always been considered more "foreign" than have the other constituent member races of the entire British Isles, including what is now the people of the Republic of Ireland, who, technically, are really foreigners.   Certainly we Scots have not been seen in quite the same light by the English as have the Welsh people as an entity.  I think that several factors are involved in this English perception of the Welsh as being "more foreign" - one being, of course, the survival of the Welsh Language, a Language seen as quite alien to English itself in so many ways.    There are characteristics of Welsh that are more similar to some Continental Languages than there are to English.   Bearing in mind the nature of the Welsh Language, you then have to consider the physical closeness of Wales to the main body of England geographically - ie the Midlands and Southern England generally, the areas most seen as the political powerhouse of England politically and culturally.  Here in Scotland we are considerably further away in distance from much of England (including London and the Home Counties) yet we are not seen as being as "foreign" as the Welsh as we do not have the "advantage" of a separate Language like they have.  Many English people feel a real sense of "difference" when crossing the border out of England and into Wales which they don\'t quite feel when driving out of England into Scotland.   I think that is entirely due to the sudden change from Anglo Saxon place names in England to the "foreign" looking Welsh place names in Wales - not to mention the fact that all road signs immediately become bi-lingual, including road markings ie "Araf" "meaning "Slow" painted on the road surfaces.  Each time I\'ve driven over the English/Welsh border (four times now) I noticed that at first the English word took precedence above the Welsh word, but the further into Wales you go - ie further into the strongholds of the still surviving (and flourishing) Welsh Language the Welsh word takes precedence.  This simply doesn\'t happen when travelling back and forth over the Scottish / English border which I have done countless numbers of times - if I had a quid for each time I\'ve crossed the border I\'d have a bloody good holiday on one of the Greek islands....or take a cruise down the Nile..I\'d love to go and take a peek at the newly resurrected King Tut.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

Anyone who reads or plans to attend a performance of Sunday in the Park With George by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine should first spend some time looking at an image of the this painting by Georges Seurat :\xa0 Its original French title is Un dimanche après-midi à l\'Île de la Grande Jatte – English translation: “ Sunday Afternoon on the Island of la Grande Jatte .” (Click on the painting title to view the online image.)  The first act of Sunday in the Park With George occurs with Seurat the artist creating and perfecting his painting. The creative musical theatre artists who were inspired by this painting drew the other characters in Act One from figures in the painting.  Looking Closely at Art  It would not be surprising to learn that Sondheim and Lapine used their own version of Visual Thinking Strategies to examine this painting that is 10 feet wide and 6 and a half feet tall.

What’s Going On? According to Sondheim and Lapine  The painting’s setting is the island of la Grande Jatte, which is located northwest of Paris in the Seine River.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian.  Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone. This scene brings their difficult relationship to a close.

A:  Quick Answer  In the Greek mythology story of Theseus and the Minotaur, King Minos of Crete ordered the labyrinth to be built as a way of housing a fierce half-man, half-bull creature known as the Minotaur, to whom seven young men and seven young women from Athens would be sacrificed each year. According to the myth, the labyrinth is a massive maze-like structure built by a man named Daedalus at the behest of King Minos; the maze that Daedalus constructed was so incredibly complex that even he could barely make his way through it. The hero Theseus ends up offering himself as a tribute to be sacrificed in the labyrinth, though his intention is to kill the Minotaur or die trying.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.

Nicknamed “The Tin Man”, and described as “as the best all-round jockey that the turf has ever seen”, Archer was the holder of several records which lasted deep into the 20th century. He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, claiming 2,748 victories from 8,064 starts. He won a total of 21 classic races, including Epson Derby five times. He committed suicide at the age of 29 after the loss of his wife during childbirth.  Sir Gordon Richards (5 May 1904 – 10 November 1986) was one of the England’s finest jockeys, often considered the world’s greatest ever jockey. He is still the only jockey to have been knighted. Gordon Richard was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times. He amassed a total of 4,870 winners, and a record 12 consecutive winners ridden. In 1999, the Racing Post (leading racing newspaper in Britain) placed him at number 1 in their list of the top 50 jockeys of 20th century.  Lester Piggott (born 5 November 1935) – is a retired professional jockey and one of the most successful English flat racing jockeys of all time. Nicknamed “The Long Fellow” to his height, Lester Piggott introduced a new style of race-riding that was adopted all over the world and enabled him to become Champion Jockey eleven times. Piggott boasts 4,493 career wins including 30 British classics.  William Lee “Bill” Shoemaker (August 19, 1931 – October 12, 2003) is one of the all-time legends who have graced the sport. Referred to as “The Shoe”, he held the world record of number of professional jockey victories for 29 years. Shoemaker used his small size (1.50 m) to his advantage riding 8,833 winners. A high school dropout, Shoemaker went to ride a total of 40,350 races, and win the United States Champion Jockey by earnings , a record 10 times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1958.  Russell Avery Braze (born 7 August 1958) is the record holder of the most race wins in North American horse racing history . He’s victory counter stopped at the astonishing 12,007 number. Baze won 400 or more races per year for four consecutive years and got rewarded with a special Eclipse Award in 1995. Since then he has on over 400 races a year seven additional times; an achievement that no other jockey has accomplished more than three times. Russell Baze was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. He also received the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 2002.  Julieann Louise “Julie” Krone (born July 24, 1963) is one of the most successful female jockeys in North American horse racing history. Julie became the first female to win a Triple Crown Race when she claimed the Belmont Stakes, riding on Colonial Affair. She sustained number of severe injuries while racing, but always came back stronger. Because of her never give up attitude, Krone was named by USA Today as one of the 10 Toughest Athletes and was honored with the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award by the Women’s Sports Foundation.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  Special relationships exist between the measures of consecutive angles, opposite angles and opposite sides of a parallelogram. A square is the most straightforward parallelogram, because it has 2 sets of parallel sides. Naturally, all of its angles and sides match in length or measure.  Facts About a Parallelogram  (1) The degree measure of the four angles of a parallelogram add up to 360 degrees. Remember that all quadrilaterals (4 sided figures) have angles which add up to 360 degrees. Here's a sample:  Then: a + b + c + d = 360 degrees  (2) The degree measure of any two consecutive angles add up to 180 degrees.                 In parallelogram ABCD:  angle a + angle b = 180 degrees  angle b + angle c = 180 degrees  angle c + angle d = 180 degrees  angle a + angle d = 180 degrees  (3) Opposite angles have the same measure in terms of degrees.  In parallelogram ABCD:  (1) Opposite sides are parallel:  side AD || side BC  NOTE: The symbol || means parallel.  (2) Opposite sides have the same lengths:  side AD = side BC  side AB = side CD  Diagonals of a Parallelogram  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two side-by-side triangles.  As shown in the picture below, diagonal AC forms equal alternate interior angles with each pair of parallel sides.  We can also see that there are two triangles in the picture below.  Triangle 1 is congruent to triangle 2 by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Method.  Where did the two triangles come from?  They were formed by diagonal AC.  I should also note that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other as shown in the picture below.  AE = EC  where E is the midpoint of BOTH diagonals.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.  A Last Hurrah  In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.  \xa0  Final Stop  After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.  \xa0  The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.  \xa0  At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

The after-taste following the last third is unusually sweet combining it with mushroom flavors. This is one of the tastiest cigars you can ever smoke.  History  Hoyo de Monterrey brand has a long history on the international market of Cuban cigars. Everything is dating since back in 1865 when Don Jose Gener y Batet established this marque of Cuban cigars after he purchased one of the most qualitative plantations of tobacco from the famous region of Cuba, Vuelta Abajo. In time, the brand imposed itself on the market, but with a higher success on the British one. There are only a few brands of Cuban cigars that can be proud of their success. The huge success of this brand was not solely because of the high quality tobacco from Vuelta Abajo, but also due to the wide variety of flavours which can be found in each line of this brand. One of the most appreciated lines created by this brand is considered to be Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure Especial. This line earned a fantastic popularity among all levels of Cuban cigars smokers.  Searching for the finest line of cigars created under the name of Hoyo de Monterrey can be a difficult task as they all are excellent.

Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ("Context: Ludwig Krapf recorded the name as both Kenia and Kegnia believed by most to be a corruption of the Kamba version.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can\'t wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read "Snow," Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, "felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf."  He has spoken up for others in peril.

It was during the Great Depression that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow went on their two-year crime spree (1932-1934). The general attitude in the United States\xa0was against government and Bonnie and Clyde used that to their advantage.

They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the "big, bad law" who were "out to get them." Clyde\'s impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie\'s poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!)  continue reading below our video  Profile of Bonnie and Clyde  Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law.  As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde\'s many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations.  While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush.  Background of Bonnie  Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker\'s job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas).  From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4\' 11" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.)  Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn\'t a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced.  While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929.  Background of Clyde  Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde\'s parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives.  When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.

The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation.

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. | Question: Who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', ['fox talbot', 'henry fox talbot'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6913'), ("Context: Many of the farms in the Western Cape province in South Africa still bear French names.

Berthing in Nigeria in 1992, this entertainment industry popularly known as Nollywood is acclaimed by industry players to rank as the third largest movie industry in the world after India’s Bollywood and America’s Nollywood. According to movie scholars and critics, Nollywood industry, which despite its relative young emergence in the global movie market has successfully become an enviable artistic cultural vehicle with which African narrative is communicated to the world, ironically emerged as a child of necessity to fill the gap created by the total collapse of the country’s theatre and stage culture.  According to industry sources, the failure of government in providing adequate security surveillance over life and property in the late 80s’and early 90s’resulted in the very negative manner at which the public viewed public shows, especially as it had to do with cinema, stage and theatrical performances with disenchantment.  Video filmartistes at a film shooting site  Also added to this ugly development “was the fact that there were inadequate television stations across the country with enough entertainment contents to satisfy the yearning needs of the viewing public, a development that led\xa0content providers to seek alternative.”  “Nollywood was a child of necessity” says Professor Ahmed Yerima, theatre artiste and former Artistic Director of The National Troupe of Nigeria. He said: “There were very few television stations and we got to a point where the TV stations that existed needed you, the producer, to get sponsorship for your productions.”  Movie-theatre going culture  But for Obby Patrick Ebewo, Nigerian born and American based film scholar, “The collapse of movie-theatre going culture in the 1980s caused by incessant harassment of innocent citizen by criminals, the country’s economic downturn and various problems affecting celluloid film production, gave rise to video film.”  The implication of this new development, according to Yerima, was that fast thinking and business minded entrepreneurs cashed into the opportunity provided by this yearning need; and aided with the arrival of VHS tapes embarked on a business trial and experimentation that was to transform the continent’s entertainment turf.  Prior to this boom, efforts had been made by some dramatists to evolve a film culture in Nigeria. It is on record that as early as the 1960s’ theatre artistes in the mould of Hubert Ogunde, had recorded his plays on celluloid. Other artistes like Moses Adejumo and Duro Ladipo had equally attempted to reduce the cinematic art of film to a more popular medium for social commentary.  In an effort to trace the emergence of Nollywood and the entire film culture in the country, Ebewo argues that “the current video film industry in Nigeria owes a huge debt to the pioneering efforts of Nigerian theatre, particularly practitioners of the Yoruba Travelling theatre, who branched off from mainstream theatre to experiment with celluloid.”  However, the Nollywood brand today owes its projection and commercial resourcefulness to Kenneth Nnebue, who according to market consensus, pioneered the raving popular media brand with his movie, Living in Bondage, in 1992.

In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the Turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ('Context: Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia, fighting against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.  Postcards from Paradise is officially out on March 31. For more on Ringo visit ringostarr.com .

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074'), ('Context: Inverted JennyThe Inverted Jenny (also known as an Upside Down Jenny, Jenny Invert) is a United States postage stamp first issued on May 10, 1918 in which the image of the Curtiss JN-4 airplane in the center of the design appears upside-down; it is probably the most famous error in American philately. Only one pane of 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in all philately. A single Inverted Jenny was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in November 2007 for $977,500. In December 2007 a mint never hinged example was sold for $825,000. The broker of the sale said the buyer was a Wall Street executive who had lost the auction the previous month.  A block of four inverted Jennys was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in October 2005 for $2.7 million.  In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, prices fetched by Inverted Jennys have receded. Between January and September 2014, five examples offered at auction sold for sums ranging from $126,000 through $575,100.  Prices seem since to have recovered, for on May 31, 2016, a particularly well-centered Jenny invert, graded XF-superb 95 by Professional Stamp Experts, was sold for at a Siegel Auction for a hammer price of $1,175,000   The addition of a 15% buyer’s premium raised the total record high price paid for this copy to $1,351,250.  Background  During the 1910s, the United States Post Office had made a number of experimental trials of carrying mail by air. These were shown by the first stamp in the world to picture an airplane (captioned as "aeroplane carrying mail"), one of the U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 1912–13.  The Post Office finally decided to inaugurate regular service on May 15, 1918, flying between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The Post Office set a controversial rate of 24 cents for the service, much higher than the 3 cents for first-class mail of the time, and decided to issue a new stamp just for this rate, patriotically printed in red and blue, and depicting a Curtiss Jenny JN-4HM, the biplane especially modified for shuttling the mail. The stamp\'s designer, Clair Aubrey Houston, apparently troubled to procure a photograph of that modified model (produced by removing the second pilot seat from the JN-4HT to create space for mailbags, and by increasing the fuel capacity). As only six such aircraft existed, there was a 1-in-6 chance that the very plane engraved on the stamp by Marcus Baldwin—Jenny #38262—would be chosen to launch the inaugural three-city airmail run; the plane on the stamp was indeed the first to depart on May 15th, taking off from Washington at 11:47 A. M.   The job of designing and printing the new stamp was carried out in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.  Many collectors long thought the blue plane portion was printed first, thus it was actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first and it is the planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, it can be seen that the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames.

It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. | Question: The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?', ['distinction'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10042'), ("Context: In the mid-1960s, corruption scandals began to arise among many of the city's officials, who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy network.

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts.  The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region.  The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. While some of the northern outposts of Aragon are inaccessible in winter because of snow, the region is, on the whole, fairly dry, enjoying a humid, Mediterranean-style climate in many areas.  Like most of Spain, Aragon was under the domination of the Moors from the 8th to the 14th centuries. However, many Muslims decided to remain in Aragon after the Christian Re-conquest, resulting in a style of architecture that is unique to Aragon.  Mudejar – meaning “those who are allowed to stay” – is a form of architecture employing bricks, plaster and the repetitive geometric patterns characteristic of early Islamic art. The buildings are finished off with ceramic tiles. The city of Teruel and the town of Calatayud are home to some of the best examples of Mudejar architecture.  Aragon may be best known for the marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla in 1469, which effectively created modern Spain. Their youngest daughter, Katherine of Aragon, became the first queen of Henry VIII of England.  Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in Spain, and funded Christopher Columbus’ expedition to America in 1492. For these accomplishments, they were dubbed “The Catholic Monarchs” by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. Everywhere in Aragon, there are reminders of the long, colorful history of Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign.  Abiding traditions  Aragon is steeped in tradition, and bull fighting and bull running play a major part in Aragonese culture. Most towns and villages hold some sort of bull festival in September; people who have issues with the ethics of bull fighting may be uncomfortable living in a region where the traditional is such an intrinsic part of local culture.  Aragon is also famous for the Jota, an energetic 17th-century dance particular to the region. While the flamenco, which originated in Andalucia, is now performed all over Spain, the Jota remains the proud possession of Aragonese culture. Both men and women perform the Jota, which involves a lot of noise and leaping around.  Moving to Aragon  Aragon has a population of around 1.3 million, of which over 10%, or about 173,000, are foreigners.  These come from all over the world, as there is significant foreign investment in the region. General Motors, Bosch Siemens and Adidas all have major plants in Aragon.  Property prices in Aragon are very competitive. On average, houses in Aragon are 56% cheaper than the national average.  Away from the regional capital of Zaragoza, which houses more than half of the region’s population, Aragon is sparsely populated. There are only two other cities– Teruel and Huesca – in all of Aragon. For those who want to get away from it all, Aragon is the place to do it.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

The bulletin was the first permanent 30-minute news broadcast in the United Kingdom, and although initially scheduled for only thirteen weeks due to fears that its length would turn viewers off,  the bulletin proved to be highly popular with audiences and became a fixture of the ITV schedule.  News at Ten rose to popularity for its winning combination of in-depth, analytical news coverage and populist stories.  It simultaneously helped popularise newscasters such as Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, Sandy Gall, Anna Ford, Alastair Stewart and Trevor McDonald into well-known television personalities.  When the bulletin was axed in 1999 in order for primetime entertainment programming to air uninterrupted, there was a public outcry. ITV reluctantly brought News at Ten back in 2001, airing it at 10pm for a minimum of three nights per week, but eventually replaced it with the ITV News at 10:30 in 2004. It was not until January 2008 that News at Ten was permanently reinstated to the ITV schedule. The programme\'s current newscaster is Tom Bradby, with Julie Etchingham, Rageh Omaar and Nina Hossain deputising.  History  1967 to 1999: the original run  ITN had been ITV\'s news provider since the channel\'s launch in September 1955. News updates from ITN tended to run 14 minutes in length at most, with no fixed broadcast time.  From his arrival in 1956, ITN editor Geoffrey Cox had consistently argued to the Independent Television Authority that ITN should be providing at least one news bulletin of substantial length, in order to cover and analyse major news stories more closely. ITV argued against the idea of a 30-minute evening bulletin, insisting a news programme of such length would eat into its primetime entertainment schedule and turn viewers away from the channel, but the ITA granted Cox\'s wish in 1967. ITV reluctantly agreed to give the proposed bulletin – a Monday-to-Friday programme, fixed at 10pm – a 13-week trial run to test its success.   News at Ten began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 under the editorship of Cox, who stipulated that the aim of the new programme was to "remove the spin and bring facts and the news as it really was." ITV\'s stance was seemingly confirmed early; the programme had little news to cover in its first few editions, having launched in the middle of summer during a slow news week. However, a reversal of fortunes quickly took place after an "action story" from ITN reporter Alan Hart on the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders re-entering Crater, which ran for a then-unheard-of length of 5 minutes.  A series of similar in-depth reports eventually helped to give News at Ten a regular viewership of seven million every night, forcing ITV to keep the programme. By 1969, News at Ten had become the first news bulletin in Britain to enter the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week.      The arrival of the new 30-minute programme allowed ITN to give a more in-depth and detailed treatment of serious news for the first time on British television, as well as coverage of populist stories and issues that would attract the viewing audience. The programme built on these concepts by introducing reporter packages, not the norm then but now a staple of television news, and a team of two newscasters taking turns to read stories instead of a sole presenter: a two-man team would inject personality into television news, as well as allow breaking news to be handed to the newscaster not in vision. The original newscasting team included Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, George Ffitch and Leonard Parkin. News at Ten also employed several other distinctive features which proved popular with viewers: the use of Big Ben\'s chimes (or "bongs") to separate the news headlines being read in the opening sequence, and the "… And Finally" report – a quirky and often humorous end piece designed to send the viewing audience to bed "on a high note" | Question: Probably best remembered as being chief presenter of ITV\'s News At Ten between 1976 and 1991which British journalist and broadcaster sadly passed away on July 20th 2012?', ['alastair burnet'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1954'), ('Context: As of December 9 , 2016 , all episodes of Raw are available on demand on the WWE Network .

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000. Westwood has performed particularly well in European Tour events, having won a total of 18 tournaments, and in 2000 he achieved the European Tour Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s seven year run of victory.

Was He More than an Exodus Hero? - Biblical Archaeology Society  Who Was Moses? Was He More than an Exodus Hero?  Discovering the Biblical Moses  Read Peter Machinist’s article “The Man Moses” as it originally appeared in Bible Review, April 2000. The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: Charles J.

The  revolver was an ivory handled .44 caliber british bulldog. He Checked  into the Riggs House hotel room 222 on the night before he was to  execute his plan.  Guiteau  arrived at the rail station early on July 2, and lay in wait for the  President to arrive, lurking about the train station to find the proper  attack point. Garfield was en route while Guiteau waited feverishly.  President James Garfield planned to leave Washington D.C. around 9:30 in the morning on July 2,  1881 from the Baltimore & Potomac train station. He was going to meet  up with First Lady Lucretia Garfield in Massachusetts for a long awaited and deserved vacation.  Garfield arrived at the rail station with Secretary of State James G. Blaine. In  another carriage just behind, followed Garfield\'s two oldest sons, while Lucretia in poor health and still recovering, was resting in a New  Jersey resort and preparing for travel.  Garfield and Secretary Blaine  arrived at the train station and were making their way through the  crowds as Guiteau approached them from behind. Guiteau raised his  gun, aimed, fired and the first shot grazed and stunned the President. He then fired  a second shot that struck the President forcefully and lodged deep into his  back. Garfield slumped to the tile floor, looking on as Guiteau was pounced upon, quickly subdued and arrested. Guiteau requested to be taken to jail at once and he was obliged.  Guiteau  Left a letter to be found the morning of the shooting addressed to  General William Tecumseh Sherman: July 2, 1881. It Read...  "I  have just shot the President.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.

From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy. And while his team mate Fangio also won three races, for the fiercely proud Farina his being crowned World Champion only officially confirmed what he considered to be | Question: Nino Farina was the first world champion of what?", ['formula one championship', 'formula one world championship', 'formula 1', 'formula one'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1521'), ('Context: Major events also play a big part in tourism in Victoria, particularly cultural tourism and sports tourism.

Edith Cresson was born January 27, 1934, in a fashionable Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Her father was a senior civil servant. Raised by a British nanny, she became fluent in the English language. Cresson attended the School of Advanced Commercial Studies, earning a degree in business and later a doctorate in demography.  A successful businesswoman, she added a second career in politics when she met François Mitterrand in 1965. For the next 26 years the future president helped Cresson advance through the ranks of what is now the French Socialist Party, calling her "my little soldier."  After Mitterrand became president in 1981, Cresson served first as minister of agriculture (1981-1983), then as minister of external trade and tourism (1983-1984), as minister of industrial restructuring and external trade (1984-1986), and finally minister of foreign affairs (1988-1990). She resigned from the government on October 3, 1990, to work as a consultant on international development. Meanwhile she was three times elected a deputy to the National Assembly from the Vienne province (1981, 1986, 1988).  Then in May 1991, President Mitterrand asked Cresson to form a new government. Some experts believe Mitterand had grown dissatisfied with the failures of the government of Michel Rocard to gain majorities in the National Assembly.   Others believe the French president foresaw major international trade issues looming as the trans-European Union came into existence, and sought Cresson\'s expertise in trade affairs.  As prime minister, the combative Cresson planned to strengthen France\'s industrial power and to "protect" French and European trade from the inroads of Japanese and American products. In assembling her new cabinet of 29 members she chose a number of holdovers from the government of her predecessor. One, Pierre Brgovoy, was named to head a new superministry combining economic, trade, industrial, and technology affairs. His appointment served to restore trust in the French leadership in financial markets. She also appointed five women, three to posts in labor, development, and youth and sports.  When her appointment to prime minister drew misogynist remarks from some politicians of France\'s center and right parties, Cresson said, "Men are not in any sense irreplaceable except in one\'s private life." Nevertheless, more fair-minded criticism about her ability to command majorities in the National Assembly persisted.  The Cresson government moved aggressively to free what had become a stagnant economy, and on contentious domestic issues, frequently centered around immigrants. Quoted making strident and antagonistic comments about the Japanese "strategy of conquest," Cresson was greatly concerned over what she was convinced to be Japan\'s major threat to European trade and commonwealth. Diplomatically, her outspokenness was creating unease in international circles. Within four months of becoming president, the Cresson government had fallen precipitously in popularity. Subtle and not-so-subtle attacks on her gender continued, including a popular daytime television show featuring two puppet characters, one a sexy and servile female broadly seen as a Cresson parody. In April 1992, Cresson resigned. Since then she has served as Commissioner for Science, Research and Development to the European Commission.  Cresson\'s husband, Jacques, a retired executive of Peugeot, the French automobile and appliance company, remained supportive of his wife, and their relationship has been likened to that of Margaret Thatcher and her husband. Cresson has been compared to the British prime minister for her bluntness, energy, and stubbornness. They have two daughters.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."

The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship.

Discovering the Biblical Moses  Read Peter Machinist’s article “The Man Moses” as it originally appeared in Bible Review, April 2000. The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ("Context: Dreamland (amusement park)  Dreamland was an ambitious amusement park at Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City from 1904 to 1911.

Unlike Dreamland, which burned in a fire in 1911, and Luna Park which, despite early success, saw its profitability disappear during the Great Depression, Steeplechase had kept itself financially profitable.

These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.

Review by Steven Suskin                             from Variety  Frequently Asked Questions  about La Cage aux Folles  What Is La Cage aux Folles Like?  This beloved 1983 musical hit has been scaled down—the stage of Broadway’s Longacre Theatre doubles as that of the La Cage nightclub, and the first few rows of the orchestra have been replaced with bistro tables. (Choose these seats if you like the idea of interacting with the characters.) Six “Cagelles” (men in drag) perform lively musical numbers to Jerry Herman’s Tony-winning score, and Harvey Fierstein’s book is as hilarious as ever. But the heart of the show is its touching portrayal of Georges and Albin’s enduring love. As the song says, “The Best of Times” is always now to see La Cage aux Folles.  Is La Cage aux Folles Good For Kids?  If you don\'t mind taking your kids to a nightclub featuring bawdy drag queens and comfortable-in-their-skin gay men (who kiss!), absolutely! School-age kids will embrace La Cage’s slapstick humor (including the comic antics of Albin’s "maid" Jacob) and will identify with Jean-Michel’s plight in feeling pulled between a desire to impress his girlfriend and loyalty to his sometimes embarrassing parents. The family at the center of the show may be unconventional, but their devotion to one another makes a strong statement about family values.

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria\'s approach was           significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte           Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste           Libeault of the Nancy           School . Faria\'s theoretical position, and the subsequent           experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant           contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of mile           Cou and the autogenic training techniques of Johannes           Heinrich Schultz .  Reichenbach  Rcamier, in 1821, prior to the           development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used           something resembling hypnoanesthesia and operated on patients under mesmeric coma.  In the 1840s and 1850s , Carl           Reichenbach began experiments to find any scientific validity to "mesmeric" energy, which he termed Odic           force after the Norse god Odin.

April 5, 2016 by Donal  Benito Mussolini with a bandaged nose, after the 1926 shooting:  In April 1926, President W.T Cosgrave sent by telegram his best wishes to a recently wounded Benito Mussolini. Coming after an attempt on the life of the Fascist leader, Cosgrave wrote:  On behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, I have the honour to congratulate Your Excellency, and the Italian people, on the providential escape of Your Excellency from the odious attempt on your person. Sincerely hoping that the wound is not serious, I send you my most earnest wishes for your speedy recover. The infamous attempt has caused much indignation here.  For Cosgrave, it was particularly important that the Free State send its best wishes, as it was an Irish assailant who made the attempt on Mussolini’s life. Ninety years ago this Thursday, Dublin born woman Violet Gibson fired a revolver shot in Rome that could have changed the course of human history. The story is well known today, and has been the subject of a book and an excellent RTE Radio documentary . This post is \xa0primarily concerned only with how the event was reported at home.  The shooting of Mussolini in front of an adoring crowd was a dramatic event, and that drama was captured in contemporary press reports.

Violet Gibson) dashed out and fired a small revolver almost point-blank in his face….  Signor Mussolini remained self-composed, reassured his entourage, and while pressing a handkerchief to the wound, gave orders that no reprisals were to be carried out against his assailant, who had been arrested. She was protected by police from the fury of the crowd, who tried to lynch her. She was carried to the police station by police and carabineers.

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. | Question: Who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', ['fox talbot', 'henry fox talbot'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6913'), ("Context: The city still contains many theatres.

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds. The name “unmodified round brilliant” was applied to a symmetrical round cut with a regular array of 58 facets, cut to modern standards. The system was the culmination of years of research that included the results of preference testing among a wide variety of groups, including trade professionals and consumers.  GIA designed the system to assess the design quality and craftsmanship of diamonds cut in the standard round brilliant style when compared to modern preferences. | Question: A modern round brilliant cut has 58 what?", ['facets'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3808'), ('Context: I Get A Kick Out Of You (ver. 2) by Cole Porter - Piano SheetsI Get A Kick Out Of You (Ver 2) Piano Sheets - Free Sheet Music for this song by Cole Porter (Piano-Sheets.net)  \xa0\xa0\xa0Other avaliable versions of this music sheet: Version\xa01 \xa0 Version\xa02 \xa0 Version\xa03 \xa0  "I Get a Kick Out of You" is a song by Cole Porter, originally featured in the Broadway musical Anything Goes and the movie of the same name.

Cole Porter is one of the few Tin Pan Alley composers to have written both lyrics and music for his songs.  Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, to a wealthy Baptist family;[1] his maternal grandfather, James Omar "J.O." Cole, was a coal and timber speculator who dominated his daughter\'s family. His mother started Porter in musical training at an early age; he learned the violin at age six, the piano at eight, and he wrote his first operetta (with help from his mother) at 10.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.  All four of us went for a ride on the Luas from Milltown to Sandyford and back. During the journey we chatted about the trams as opposed to the buses.

The basic services of the phlebotomist include taking blood samples from patients and correctly cataloging them for lab analysis, but the importance of the phlebotomist is far more critical than this simple description implies.  slide 2 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Critical Responsibilities  Since phlebotomists have an extremely high potential to be exposed to blood borne diseases and contaminants, the level of caution and expertise they use in the execution of their duties is critical to their own safety as well as all others that may be exposed to the fluid samples they draw. Under the direction of a physician or other licensed health care professional, phlebotomists duties includes collecting samples of blood and other fluids from patients. Prior to collection, it is the phlebotomist’s responsibility to assure that all collection instruments and environments are sterile and of first use.  After sample collection, the phlebotomists duties will include correctly labeling the collection container with pertinent patient information for identification, and subsequently must complete and file companion paperwork to trace the route of the sample from collection through lab work through final analysis and diagnosis and finally to proper disposal of the fluids. Any error in the job of a phlebotomist can have consequences that range from misdiagnosis to fatal contamination. In addition, phlebotomists on a hospital staff will also be required to train other phlebotomists in sample collection and follow up.  slide 3 of 5  Additional Phlebotomists Duties  Some phlebotomists duties, for example those that conduct home care visits, will also include being responsible for transportation of fluid samples between the sample site and the laboratory. In some cases the phlebotomists duties will also include being responsible for performing certain functions to process blood samples for further analysis by attending medical professionals.  Phlebotomists that work in a laboratory environment have the added task of ensuring that samples are correctly analyzed by enforcing quality control and safety measures to prevent the contamination of samples during analysis.  slide 4 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Education and Career  Phlebotomy training is obtained by passing a one year vocational program which is offered through technical schools or community colleges. Many community colleges also offer associate’s degree programs in phlebotomy. In addition to becoming certified as a phlebotomist, some states will require licensing or registration.  A certified phlebotomist can expect an annual salary ranging from $20,000 to $48,000, with an increase in demand for services expected through 2012. As the demand increases, more facilities will require pre-certification of phlebotomists before they are hired, to reduce the impact of liability.  Phlebotomists' duties and services are usually scheduled, rather than performed under emergency situations. Given this fact, phlebotomists usually have the benefit of shift hours that match regular office hours, which is a luxury not typically found in the medical profession.  slide 5 of 5 | Question: What does a phlebotomist usually deal with?", ['taking blood'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3552'), ('Context: The Internet protocol suite ( TCP / IP ) was developed by Robert E.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

Location of Coney Island on a map.  Coney Island is a city found in New York , The United States Of America . It is located 40.58 latitude and -73.99 longitude and it is situated at elevation 2 meters above sea level.  Coney Island has a population of 60,000 making it the 23rd biggest city in New York. It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.  Things to Do and See in Coney Island  The Coney Island Museum  For less than a dollar, visitors can get to see artifacts that bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear Coney Island in this quaint museum. Located on the second floor of an historic building on Surf Avenue with a delightful view of classic amusement park rides, the Coney Island museum interprets and preserves the history of the area through a small but fascinating collection of items. Visitors get to see quirky pieces of the collection, such as a hand-carved figure of the Steeplechase Man and Boardwalk rolling chair.  The museum is open every Saturday and Sunday between 12 and 5 pm, right through the year, with opening hours sometimes extended during the summer months. The museum also serves as a tourist information center where visitors can use the bathrooms and receive knowledgeable answers to the questions about the area.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper Mérimée\'s novella Carmen.

Since then, the plot of the novel has woven its way into popular culture: Captain Ahab and the hunt for the White Whale continue to spark adaptations, reworkings, and allusions, while the opening line, "Call me Ishmael," remains one of the most well-known first words in fiction. However, Ishmael both as narrator and character has been primarily the property of academic rather than popular culture. Particularly following F. O. Matthiessen s classic American Renaissance, published in 1941 in the midst of the Nazi aggression, Ishmael has been appropriated by critics intent upon finding in him the figure of resistance to totalitarianism and fulfillment of democratic freedom. Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity. But the Holocaust (the Shoah) effectively marks the final collapse of traditional Western humanism. Jewish thinkers such as George Steiner and Emmanuel Levinas have been reassessing this collapse and its consequences. Both suggest alternative Jewish humanisms that reread Western culture and literature through a "Holocaust hermeneutics" that ethicizes and morally impassions the act of reading, studying, and responding to texts, and that elevates the role of the textual and human Other to one of primacy and priority. Rereading Moby-Dick under Steinerian and Levinasian norms reveals an Ishmael whose dealings with the Other pose troubling ethical questions in a post-Shoah world, and challenges the traditional "Cold War consensus" that makes of Ishmael the American emblem of Western freedom and humanitarianism  Subject  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEAHey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEA  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe?

Logan Smalley and Stephanie Kent were at a bar one evening in New York when the conversation turned to books, and specifically, to first sentences of novels. In any such conversation, three words in particular are invariably mentioned: “Call me Ishmael,” the iconic opening of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. What came next was a question that in hindsight, seems unthinkable no one had ever asked before: What if you really could call Ishmael? “We quickly realized that it was a pun worth keeping,” Smalley said.  Smalley and Kent set to work creating Call Me Ishmael , a platform for people to tell personal stories about books they love, with the hopes of connecting people with their next great read. They set up a cell phone number for Ishmael, which goes straight to voice mail and prompts people to anonymously leave a message about “a book you’ve loved and a story you’ve lived.” A few\xa0times a week, Smalley transcribes a message by typewriter, filming the text as it scrolls up the typewriter carriage in time to the audio.  Although Smalley is no literary luddite—he and Kent both read and e-read—he said this particular project called for something more tangible than is typical in our digital age. “[People] want to call a complete stranger and tell them the really profound and potentially really personal story about how a book has affected them,” said Smalley. “That exchange, to us, necessitates something that feels very handmade and safe and comfortable, and gets a legitimate treatment.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed.

The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.

The 2012 Summer Olympics included 26 sports, with two additional sports due to be added to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports.  The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF).  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of Aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation),  or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of Skating, represented by the International Skating Union).  In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport\'s prevalence. The IOC\'s requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well—more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and Summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).  Previous Olympic Games included sports which are no longer present on the current program, like polo and tug of war.  These sports, known as "discontinued sports", were later removed either because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body. Archery and tennis are examples of sports that were competed at the early Games and were later dropped by the IOC, but managed to return to the Olympic program (in 1972 and 1988, respectively). Demonstration sports have often been included in the Olympic Games, usually to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport.  Some such sports, like baseball and curling, were added to the official Olympic program (in 1992 and 1998, respectively). Baseball, however, was discontinued after the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Olympic sports definitions  The term "sport" in Olympic terminology refers to all the events that are sanctioned by one international sport federation, a definition that may be different from the common meaning of the word sport. One sport, by Olympic definition, may be divided into several disciplines, which are often regarded as separate sports in common language.  For example: Aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines: Swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and high diving (the last of which is a non-Olympic discipline), since all these disciplines are governed at international level by the International Swimming Federation. Skating is a winter Olympic sport represented by the International Skating Union, and includes four disciplines: figure skating, speed skating (on a traditional long track), short track speed skating and synchronized skating (the latter is a non-Olympic discipline). The sport with the largest number of Olympic disciplines is skiing, with six: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, nordic combined, snowboarding and freestyle skiing.  Other notable multi-discipline sports are gymnastics (artistic, rhythmic and trampoline), cycling (road, track, mountain and BMX), volleyball (indoors and beach), wrestling (freestyle and Greco-Roman), canoeing (flatwater and slalom) and bobsleigh (includes skeleton). The disciplines listed here are only those contested in the Olympics—gymnastics has two non-Olympic disciplines, while cycling and wrestling have three each.  It should also be noted that the IOC definition of a "discipline" may differ from that used by an international federation. For example, the IOC considers artistic gymnastics a single discipline, but the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG) classifies men\'s and women\'s artistic gymnastics as separate disciplines.  Similarly, the IOC considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline, but United World Wrestling uses "freestyle wrestling | Question: Summer Olympic sports are divided into categories based on popularity and the potential in generating revenue.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers.

But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."

Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking.

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.

Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance. At the end of "State Farm," the funky white-girl rap from You and Me Both that kicks off side two of the set, Moyet laughs with almost girlish delight at the crowd\'s enthusiastic reaction. The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts. There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along. The sound on the set is a bit muddy, but the duo\'s enthusiastic performance more than makes up for the sonic limitations. ~ j. poet  Reconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusicReconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Reconnected: Live  google+  AllMusic Review                             by j. poet  In the early \'80s, Vince Clarke quit Depeche Mode , allegedly dissatisfied with their move toward pop music.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian.  Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone. This scene brings their difficult relationship to a close.

The bulletin was the first permanent 30-minute news broadcast in the United Kingdom, and although initially scheduled for only thirteen weeks due to fears that its length would turn viewers off,  the bulletin proved to be highly popular with audiences and became a fixture of the ITV schedule.  News at Ten rose to popularity for its winning combination of in-depth, analytical news coverage and populist stories.  It simultaneously helped popularise newscasters such as Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, Sandy Gall, Anna Ford, Alastair Stewart and Trevor McDonald into well-known television personalities.  When the bulletin was axed in 1999 in order for primetime entertainment programming to air uninterrupted, there was a public outcry. ITV reluctantly brought News at Ten back in 2001, airing it at 10pm for a minimum of three nights per week, but eventually replaced it with the ITV News at 10:30 in 2004. It was not until January 2008 that News at Ten was permanently reinstated to the ITV schedule. The programme\'s current newscaster is Tom Bradby, with Julie Etchingham, Rageh Omaar and Nina Hossain deputising.  History  1967 to 1999: the original run  ITN had been ITV\'s news provider since the channel\'s launch in September 1955. News updates from ITN tended to run 14 minutes in length at most, with no fixed broadcast time.  From his arrival in 1956, ITN editor Geoffrey Cox had consistently argued to the Independent Television Authority that ITN should be providing at least one news bulletin of substantial length, in order to cover and analyse major news stories more closely. ITV argued against the idea of a 30-minute evening bulletin, insisting a news programme of such length would eat into its primetime entertainment schedule and turn viewers away from the channel, but the ITA granted Cox\'s wish in 1967. ITV reluctantly agreed to give the proposed bulletin – a Monday-to-Friday programme, fixed at 10pm – a 13-week trial run to test its success.   News at Ten began broadcasting on 3 July 1967 under the editorship of Cox, who stipulated that the aim of the new programme was to "remove the spin and bring facts and the news as it really was." ITV\'s stance was seemingly confirmed early; the programme had little news to cover in its first few editions, having launched in the middle of summer during a slow news week. However, a reversal of fortunes quickly took place after an "action story" from ITN reporter Alan Hart on the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders re-entering Crater, which ran for a then-unheard-of length of 5 minutes.  A series of similar in-depth reports eventually helped to give News at Ten a regular viewership of seven million every night, forcing ITV to keep the programme. By 1969, News at Ten had become the first news bulletin in Britain to enter the top 20 most-watched programmes of the week.      The arrival of the new 30-minute programme allowed ITN to give a more in-depth and detailed treatment of serious news for the first time on British television, as well as coverage of populist stories and issues that would attract the viewing audience. The programme built on these concepts by introducing reporter packages, not the norm then but now a staple of television news, and a team of two newscasters taking turns to read stories instead of a sole presenter: a two-man team would inject personality into television news, as well as allow breaking news to be handed to the newscaster not in vision. The original newscasting team included Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, Reginald Bosanquet, George Ffitch and Leonard Parkin. News at Ten also employed several other distinctive features which proved popular with viewers: the use of Big Ben\'s chimes (or "bongs") to separate the news headlines being read in the opening sequence, and the "… And Finally" report – a quirky and often humorous end piece designed to send the viewing audience to bed "on a high note" | Question: Probably best remembered as being chief presenter of ITV\'s News At Ten between 1976 and 1991which British journalist and broadcaster sadly passed away on July 20th 2012?', ['alastair burnet'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1954'), ('Context: St Vincents Hall  St Vincents Hall, Grantham, is a Gothic Revival mansion built in 1868 for the industrialist Richard Hornsby who founded Richard Hornsby & Sons, engine and machinery manufacturer.

Traditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and HullsTraditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and Hulls  Caulking Decks and Hulls  Introduction  Caulking is defined by driving oakum, cotton or general rope fibres in the seams of a ship's wooden deck or side / hull to make it watertight. It also plays a structural role in tightening up the hull / deck of a ship and reduces the longitudinal movement of neighbouring planks.  It is very easy to demonstrate the principles behind caulking a vessel, however, it is a skill where practice is\xa0 important but also individual vessels present their own issues. Usually you will have to warm to the task, understand which iron you\xa0 have to use, and how much oakum. There is a lot in the skill that simply comes from experience and new builds present different\xa0 issues to old boats.  The final pitching of the seam was not demonstrated because it was not occurring at the time of the\xa0 demonstration.  Procedure  The process is demonstrated in the accompanying video clips with a step-by-step guide. The conversation with the boat builder, in this case, Chris Rees is unscripted and covers the technique from his experience.  The technique is very simple but the subtleties come with experience:  Clean the seam to be caulked.  Twist a length of caulking material (oakum or cotton).

It was during the Great Depression that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow went on their two-year crime spree (1932-1934). The general attitude in the United States\xa0was against government and Bonnie and Clyde used that to their advantage. With an image closer to Robin Hood rather than mass murderers, Bonnie and Clyde captured the imagination of the nation.  Dates: Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910 -- May 23, 1934); Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909 -- May 23, 1934)  Also Known As: Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, The Barrow Gang  Overview of Bonnie and Clyde  In some ways it was easy to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde. They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the "big, bad law" who were "out to get them." Clyde\'s impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie\'s poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!)  continue reading below our video  Profile of Bonnie and Clyde  Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law.  As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde\'s many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations.  While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush.  Background of Bonnie  Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker\'s job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas).  From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4\' 11" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.)  Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn\'t a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced.  While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929.  Background of Clyde  Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde\'s parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives.  When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.  At that time, West Dallas was a very rough neighborhood and Clyde fit right in.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.  Queen Anne's Signature  Quotes:  �She meant well and was not a fool; but nobody can maintain that she was wise, nor entertaining in conversation� � Sarah Churchill (about Queen Anne)  �Queen Anne was the quintessence of ordinariness; she also had more than her fair share of small-mindedness, vulgarity and downright meanness� � Historian J.P.

BBC Review  Back in June 1994 the three \'W\'s only stood for one thing - and it had nothing to do...  David Hooper 2004  Back in June 1994 the three \'W\'s only stood for one thing - and it had nothing to do with the Internet. Wet Wet Wet were at the pinnacle of their career then, when - thanks largely to a Hugh Grant film - they managed to stay at no.1 for what seemed likethree years with the Troggs cover, "Love Is All Around".  But the Wets were no one-hit-wonders. In fact, they managed to notch up 25 hits during their decade of chart success and became one of Britain\'s most successful bands ever. In 1999, however, it all went a bit wrong, with Marti Pellow announcing a solo career and a drug problem, and the four going their separate ways.The band didn\'t see each other for four years after that. The good news (or bad, as the case may be) is that 22 years after forming, Wet Wet Wet are well and truly back, with a Greatest Hits, a big UK arena tour, a DVD and their first single for seven years.  There are three brand new tracks on this collection, but none of them mark a massive musical departure for the band. No drum \'n\' bass experimentation here. The single -"All I Want" -opens the album in a poppy, bluesy, country style, and Wet Wet Wet fans will immediately feel like the band never split. Of the other new ones, "Hear Me Now", with its jangly guitars and orchestral backing, is unoutstanding. Album-closer "(Feels Like I\'m) Walking On Water" is a soothing combination of steel guitar, organ and strings, giving them a more mature sound than before.  As for the hits, they include the upbeat and marvellously 80s synth-brass fest, "Sweet Little Mystery", and the chart-toppers: "WithA Little Help From My Friends", "Love Is All Around" and "Goodnight Girl". While many Wet Wet Wet tunes tend to disappear into the background, there can be no denying that they\'re responsible for some truly soulful pop gems, and The Greatest Hits is proof of that.  Unfortunately, much like Dido, Travis and Ronan Keating, Wet Wet Wet are unlikely to do anything exciting, ever, but they\'re sure to sell bucketloads more records - and just in time for Christmas, too.

Semenya won gold in the women\'s 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final. Semenya also won silver medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics, both in the 800 metres.  Following her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. She was withdrawn from international competition until 6 July 2010 when the IAAF cleared her to return to competition.  In 2010, the British magazine New Statesman included Semenya in a list of "50 People That Matter 2010".   Early life and education  Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in South Africa near Polokwane (back then called Pietersburg), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, "deep in South Africa\'s northern Limpopo province." She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a tomboy as a child.   Semenya attended Nthema Secondary School and now attends the University of Pretoria as a sports science student.   She began running as training for soccer.   Career  2008  In July Semenya participated in the 2008 World Junior Championships, and won the gold in the 800 m at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a time of 2:04.23.   2009  In the African Junior Championships Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.    With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone. The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date. It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by Zelda Pretorius at 1:58.85, and Zola Budd at 2:00.90, respectively.   The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it was "obliged to investigate" after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m\xa0– "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use."  The IAAF also asked Semenya to undergo a gender test after the win. News that the IAAF requested the test broke three hours before the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions."   In August Semenya won gold in the 800 metres at the World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final, again setting the fastest time of the year.   Gender test  Following her victory at the world championships, questions were raised about her gender.    The IAAF\'s handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticized the organization for its response to the incident.  Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as racist, as well as an affront to Semenya\'s privacy and human rights.   The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted."  The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a "rare medical condition" giving her an unfair competitive advantage. The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.  In an interview with South African magazine YOU Semenya stated, "God made me the way I am and I accept myself." She also took part in a makeover with the magazine.   On 7 September 2009, Wilfred Daniels, Semenya\'s coach with Athletics South Africa (ASA), resigned because he felt that ASA "did not advise Ms. Semenya properly". He apologised for personally having failed to protect her.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

The location(s) of the Adrenal Glands:  The human body normally* includes two adrenal glands.  They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.

Time of Publication: 2:08 pm.  2:08 pm  The 10 Most Walkable Cities in America  Mitchell Funk/Getty  Cities that make life easier for pedestrians are, to many, better places to live. Studies have shown that walkable urban areas are healthier, wealthier and safer (perhaps in part because wealthy people can afford to live in nicer places)—and anyway, who doesn’t want to go outside every once in a while?  If getting around without a car appeals, you should head to New York City or San Francisco (if you can afford either). That’s according to a new ranking of the most walkable large US cities by Redfin, a real estate analysis website and brokerage.  The site uses something it calls Walk Score, an algorithm to measure how convenient it is to do daily errands without wheels, on a 100-point scale. It doesn’t take into account public transit systems (there’s a different score for that), but looks at things like the walking distance to schools, restaurants, and grocery stores, from any given point.  “It’s a population-rated average, sampled at every block,” explains Matt Lerner, VP of products at Redfin. “We’re basically sampling the walk score for every block in the city, weighted by the number of people who live there.” Cities are scored by where the population is, and aren’t penalized for non-walkable areas like shipping ports, industrial districts, and airports.  Most of the cities in the Redfin top 10 are unsurprising. NYC, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Washington D.C. all got big before the automobile age, so they were made for moving on foot. But the top scores for Miami, Oakland, and Seattle point to the fact that history isn’t all that matters. Cities can change to cater to pedestrians instead of, or at least in addition to, cars.  Lots of cities have become more pedestrian-friendly since Redfin’s last rankings, in 2011. Four years ago, New York City and San Francisco had basically the same score (about 85). Now, the Big Apple’s several points up, thanks to pro-walking efforts like booting cars out of Times Square, Lerner says.  Detroit didn’t crack the top ten, but its score went up 2.2 points, to 52.2, in part thanks to the downtown arrival of big companies like Quicken Loans, bringing restaurants, shops, and businesses with them. New Orleans’ score rose nearly a point, as it develops more affordable housing and revitalizes commercial districts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Miami has seen a surge of development, with new mixed-use commercial and residential areas opening up in the past few years. So there’s good news for pedestrians all over the country.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

Macleod’s medal, together with one earned by rower Alex Partridge, had been snatched Wednesday from the Mahiki nightclub, where the athletes went following a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in honor of Britain’s Olympic team.  Macleod and Partridge had publicly appealed for their return. Her medal was mailed anonymously to the England Hockey head office.  Police say the medal is being retained as part of its investigation but will be returned to the athlete shortly.  Police stressed Friday that the hunt is still on for Partridge’s medal and Macleod’s team jacket.  Police say a 31-year-old man had been arrested in the case and was later released on bail.  Rower Alex Partridge is still waiting for the return of his medal.  Earlier Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod had appealed for the return of their stolen Olympic bronze medals from London 2012.  Partridge said he was devastated when he realised his blazer, which had the medal in an inside pocket, had gone.  The 31-year-old told BBC Sport: “It’s very, very upsetting. It would mean everything to me to get them back.”  Partridge, whose bronze in the men’s eight followed a silver medal at the Beijing Games in 2008, added: “I worked for 12 years of my life to try to achieve something at the Olympic Games and that’s what I’ve got to show for it.  “While we were out and dancing away, I noticed I’d misplaced my blazer. In the morning, I thought one of the other Olympians must have picked it up by accident, but no-one had it.  “I always say to people ‘it’s not about the medal, it’s about the journey’, but I guess you don’t appreciate the value of it until it’s not there.  “It was only when I picked up my 16-month-old daughter from nursery that it really dawned on me. If it doesn’t come back she won’t see everything I worked for, which was a representation of being in the best British Olympic team and possibly the best Olympics ever.”  Macleod, who won her London 2012 bronze medal with the women’s hockey team, believes the theft was pre-meditated after viewing CCTV footage.  “It looked like a very well done job,” Macleod told BBC Radio 5 live.  “The CCTV footage shows a couple who were acting suspiciously and had done a couple of laps of the bar, scoping things out prior to approaching our group.”  \xa0  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news ...Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news | The Guardian  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post  Hannah Macleod's medal, taken from London nightclub while athletes partied, posted anonymously to England Hockey  London 2012 Olympic medalist Hannah MacLeod, whose bronze medal for hockey has been returned.

The main research for this compilation has been conducted by Ms. Christabel Manning , LL.B, a graduate of the University of Dar Es Salaam currently working in the Legal Department at KPMG (T) Limited and a member of the Tanzania Women Lawyers Association-TAWLA.  \xa0  \xa0  Introduction  The United Republic of Tanzania is situated on the eastern seaboard of the African continent, about one degree south of the Equator. Its eastern border is the Indian Ocean, it shares its northern border with the Republic of Kenya and Uganda, and to the West it borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Rwanda and the Republic of Burundi. The Republic of Zambia and the Republic of Malawi share its borders on the southwest, while in the South it shares a border with Mozambique; it is the union of two historical countries, Tanganyika and Zanzibar.  \xa0  The United Republic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 through the union of two independent states, namely the Republic of Tanganyika and the Peoples’ Republic of Zanzibar. Zanzibar is an autonomous part of the United Republic, and is made up of two islands, namely Unguja and Pemba, which are found in the territorial waters of the United Republic, in the Indian Ocean. Another island to the south east of the Tanzania, Mafia, is an integral part of mainland Tanzania.  \xa0  Tanganyika gained its independence from the British, who administered her after the end of the WWII under the United Nations Trusteeship; on 9th December 1961 she became a Republic on 9th December 1962. Zanzibar became independent on 12th December 1963. Prior to her independence, Zanzibar, which was ruled by an Arab Sultanate, and enjoyed a protectorate status under the British. One month after she gained independence, the Arab Sultanate regime of Zanzibar was overthrown by a popular revolution on 12th January 1964, which led to the creation of the Revolution Government of Zanzibar.  \xa0  The Republic of Tanganyika and the Peoples’ Republic of Zanzibar entered into a union on 26th April 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which was later renamed on 29th October the United Republic of Tanzania.  \xa0  At the time of the Union, Tanganyika was governed by a political party know as the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), the nationalist party which won the country its independence, while Zanzibar was rule by the Afro Shiraz Party (ASP) which had lead the popular revolution.  The two states were by then governed under the one party system of government, i.e. the one party state democracy, which was then very prevalent in Africa. In 1977 the TANU and ASP merged to form the Chama Cha Mapinduzi-CCM party, (otherwise known as the Revolutionary Party), which continued to exercise political control through out the country under the one party regime.  \xa0  The United Republic of Tanzania was under the leadership of one party system until 1992 when she adopted a new constitution, which enabled the organization of pluralist political parties, and hence in 1995 the first multi party democratic elections were held in the country. Since 1995 the country has held such multi party elections in 2000, and 2005.  \xa0  Sources of Law  Tanzania’s legal system is based on the English Common Law system. It derived this system from its British colonial legacy, as it does the system of government, which is based to a large degree on the Westminster parliamentary model.  The Constitution  Unlike the unwritten British constitutional system, the first source of law for the United Republic of Tanzania is the 1977 Constitution.  The constitutional history of Tanganyika traces its background from the 1961 Independence Constitution, which was adopted at the time of independence. In 1962 Tanganyika adopted the Republican Constitution, which operated from 1962 up to 1965. These two were | Question: Tanzania was renamed in 1964.

The 2012 Summer Olympics included 26 sports, with two additional sports due to be added to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports.  The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF).  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of Aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation),  or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of Skating, represented by the International Skating Union).  In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport\'s prevalence. The IOC\'s requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well—more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and Summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).  Previous Olympic Games included sports which are no longer present on the current program, like polo and tug of war.  These sports, known as "discontinued sports", were later removed either because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body. Archery and tennis are examples of sports that were competed at the early Games and were later dropped by the IOC, but managed to return to the Olympic program (in 1972 and 1988, respectively). Demonstration sports have often been included in the Olympic Games, usually to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport.  Some such sports, like baseball and curling, were added to the official Olympic program (in 1992 and 1998, respectively). Baseball, however, was discontinued after the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Olympic sports definitions  The term "sport" in Olympic terminology refers to all the events that are sanctioned by one international sport federation, a definition that may be different from the common meaning of the word sport. One sport, by Olympic definition, may be divided into several disciplines, which are often regarded as separate sports in common language.  For example: Aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines: Swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and high diving (the last of which is a non-Olympic discipline), since all these disciplines are governed at international level by the International Swimming Federation. Skating is a winter Olympic sport represented by the International Skating Union, and includes four disciplines: figure skating, speed skating (on a traditional long track), short track speed skating and synchronized skating (the latter is a non-Olympic discipline). The sport with the largest number of Olympic disciplines is skiing, with six: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, nordic combined, snowboarding and freestyle skiing.  Other notable multi-discipline sports are gymnastics (artistic, rhythmic and trampoline), cycling (road, track, mountain and BMX), volleyball (indoors and beach), wrestling (freestyle and Greco-Roman), canoeing (flatwater and slalom) and bobsleigh (includes skeleton). The disciplines listed here are only those contested in the Olympics—gymnastics has two non-Olympic disciplines, while cycling and wrestling have three each.  It should also be noted that the IOC definition of a "discipline" may differ from that used by an international federation. For example, the IOC considers artistic gymnastics a single discipline, but the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG) classifies men\'s and women\'s artistic gymnastics as separate disciplines.  Similarly, the IOC considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline, but United World Wrestling uses "freestyle wrestling | Question: Summer Olympic sports are divided into categories based on popularity and the potential in generating revenue.

The term has thus been applied as a name to the speech in its entirety.  It is considered a defining speech in Thatcher\'s political development,  becoming something of a Thatcherite motto.   The phrase made reference to Thatcher\'s refusal to perform a "U-turn" in response to opposition to her liberalisation of the economy, which some commentators and Ted Heath had urged,  mainly because unemployment had risen to 2 million by the autumn of 1980 from 1.5 million the previous year and the economy was in recession,  exceeding 3 million by the time the recession ended in 1982.   It was written by the playwright Sir Ronald Millar, who had been Thatcher\'s speech-writer since 1973, and was a pun on the 1948 play The Lady\'s Not for Burning by Christopher Fry, although Thatcher missed the reference herself.    Millar had intended the "you turn if you want to" line, which preceded it, to be the most popular, and it received an ovation itself, but it was "the lady\'s not for turning" that received the headlines. At the time, Thatcher was already being referred to as the "Iron Lady".  The speech as a whole was very warmly received at the conference, and received a five-minute standing ovation.  Excerpt  United Kingdom general election, 1979The United Kingdom general election of 1979 was held on 3 May 1979 to elect 635 members to the British House of Commons.  The Conservative Party, led by Margaret Thatcher, ousted the incumbent Labour government of James Callaghan with a parliamentary majority of 44 seats.  The election was the first of four consecutive election victories for the Conservative Party, and Thatcher became the United Kingdom and Europe\'s first female elected head of government.  The previous parliamentary term had begun in October 1974, when Harold Wilson led Labour to a majority of three seats, but within 18 months he had resigned as prime minister to be succeeded by James Callaghan, and within a year the government\'s narrow parliamentary majority had gone.  Callaghan had made agreements with the Liberals, the Ulster Unionists, as well as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists in order to remain in power. However, on 28 March 1979 following the defeat of the Scottish devolution referendum, Thatcher tabled a motion of no confidence in James Callaghan\'s Labour government, which was passed by just one vote (311 to 310), triggering a general election five months before the end of the government\'s term.  The Labour campaign was hampered by the series of industrial disputes and strikes during the Winter of 1978-79, known as the Winter of Discontent and the party focused its campaign on support for the National Health Service and full employment. After intense media speculation, Callaghan had announced early in the autumn of 1978 that a general election would not take place that year having received private polling data which suggested a parliamentary majority was unlikely.   The Conservative campaign employed the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi and pledged to control inflation as well as curbing the power of the trade unions.  The Liberal Party was damaged by allegations that its former leader Jeremy Thorpe had been involved in a homosexual affair, and had conspired to murder his former lover.  The Liberals were now being led by David Steel, meaning that all three major parties entered the election with a new leader.  The election saw a 5.2% swing from Labour to the Conservatives, the largest swing since the 1945 election, which Clement Attlee won for Labour.  Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister, and Callaghan was replaced as Labour leader by Michael Foot in 1980.  Results for the election were broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by David Dimbleby, Robert McKenzie, David Butler and Robin Day.   It was the first  general election to feature Rick Wakeman\'s song Arthur on the BBC\'s coverage.

You may enter both the festival and tents free of charge (with the exception of the “Historical Wies’n” which requires a small fee). Oktoberfest showcases 14 spectacular tents with 1,000 - 8,500 seats which are owned by various restaurants, breweries and other establishments. There are also a number of smaller tents and beer gardens in the vicinity.\xa0  All tents are unique and have their own charm, so if you have the time, we recommend trying to check them all out! The tents serve Bavarian beers, traditional eats, and are booming with live music throughout the day and night. Music performances are comprised of a mix of both traditional Bavarian music and contemporary bands playing later in the evenings.\xa0  While it’s possible to visit all of the tents, the issue is whether or not you can get a seat, especially on weekends and during bad weather. Although tents do offer reservations, they can be next to impossible to get. Reservations are typically given to large German companies and groups, and the tents always serve their existing customers from previous years first.\xa0  The remaining requests are put on a daunting waiting list; nonetheless, it’s still worth a shot! If you’re travelling in a small group of 2 or 3, you can patiently wait until someone leaves, and then quickly grab their table. And if it’s a pretty crowded day, you’ll be better off remaining at the table instead of venturing off to another tent where you’ll likely meet another long wait. Note that tents will be closed if they become too full, and will be re-opened later when more space is available. For a map and details on the fourteen tents, check out Oktoberfest’s Tent Guide with photos and descriptions of each tent.  Beer & Other Beverages  The Oktoberfest beer is by far the event’s most popular attraction. Large one liter beers are served in traditional German “Maß” mugs. The Club of Munich Brewers maintains strict regulations on exactly which brands of beer can be served at the festival. There are currently only 6 breweries whose beer meets the criteria.

Published on Nov 8, 2014  This video is about Mitochondrial Eve  The idea that a African Woman, “Mitochondrial Eve", is the woman from whom all people on earth inherit their DNA  Is proven to be a scientific  fact.  In the field of human genetics, the name Mitochondrial Eve refers to the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living anatomically modern humans,  She is from Africa, & is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago.  This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend.  The dating for "Eve" was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis and a boost to the theory of the origin and dispersion of modern humans from Africa.  The biblical connotation was very clear from the start.  1 January 1987 in Nature, in which their findings clearly showed that all current human mtDNA originated from a single population from Africa.  mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or matrilineally.  The Human MRCA studies, confirm that All humans alive today share a surprisingly recent common African ancestor, This is true, even for people born on different continents.  Category  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through ...Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  by John Taylor  Background:  In human genetics, Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans. This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend, in an unbroken line, on their mother’s side, and through the mothers of those mothers, and so on, back until all lines converge on one woman, who is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago. Because all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) generally (but see paternal mtDNA transmission) is passed from mother to offspring without recombination, all mtDNA in every living person is directly descended from hers by definition, differing only by the mutations that over generations have occurred in the germ cell mtDNA since the conception of the original “Mitochondrial Eve”.  Mitochondrial Eve is named after mitochondria and the biblical Eve. Unlike her biblical namesake, she was not the only living human female of her time. However, her female contemporaries, excluding her mother, failed to produce a direct unbroken female line to any living person in the present day.  Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived between 99,000 and 200,000 years ago, most likely in East Africa, when Homo sapiens sapiens (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species.  Origin of the name:  Cann, Stoneking and Wilson did not use the term “Mitochondrial Eve” or even the name “Eve” in their original paper; it appears to be a catchy term popularised by the media. The name appeared in a 1987 article in Science by Roger Lewin, headlined “The Unmasking of Mitochondrial Eve.” The biblical connotation was very clear from the start.

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence. Those proceedings have been protracted and sometimes arcane, but Siegel and Shuster’s names were eventually restored to the credits pages of all Superman comics, and Siegel’s heirs were ultimately successful | Question: The rights to which famous character were sold by creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster to Detective Comics for $130 in 1937?', ['superman', 'superman character', 'superman comics'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2367')]

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

It has been described as the earliest of its kind in Europe, with historian Will Durant calling the Minoans "the first link in the European chain". | Question: The USS Daedalus was named after an exiled Athenian representative of artists from which culture?', ['Minoan civilization'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-1758'), ("Context: This combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic ground state.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: A pulmonary artery is an artery in the pulmonary circulation that carries deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs .

They are a class of retrotransposons, DNA elements that amplify themselves throughout eukaryotic genomes, often through RNA intermediates.  Short-interspersed nuclear elements are characterized by their size and method of retrotransposition.  The literature differs on the length of the SINEs but there is a general consensus that they often range in length from about 100 to 700 base pairs (more or less, arbitrary cut-offs).  Short-interspersed nuclear elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III which is known to transcribe ribosomal RNA and tRNA, two types of RNA vital to ribosomal assembly and mRNA translation.  SINEs, like tRNAs and many small-nuclear RNAs possess an internal promoter and thus are transcribed differently than most protein-coding genes.  In other words, short-interspersed nuclear elements have their key promoter elements within the transcribed region itself.  Though transcribed by RNA polymerase III, SINEs and other genes possessing internal promoters, recruit different transcriptional machinery and factors than genes possessing upstream promoters.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.

But on the other hand, it’s quite a chore to make a Cassata alla Siciliana and although Fabrizia Lanza sailed through it without breaking a sweat, between using the right pan, mixing up your own almond paste, finding ricotta as good as the ricotta in Sicily, and getting the candied fruit (including the squash, which is the translucent white brick on the platter), it might be classified as one of those things that’s better left to the Sicilians.  (Nevertheless, if you want to give it a go, Saveur printed her Cassata recipe, and it’s also in her book, Coming Home to Sicily . I linked to additional recipes at the end of the post.)  According to Italian food specialist Clifford A. Wright , the word Cassata is derived from the Arabic word quas’at, or qas’at, which refers to a wide bowl. There is actually a special pan to make the cake; it’s a mold with sloped sides and a groove around the bottom so that when Cassata mold is lined with strips of almond paste, and overturned, there’s a rim to create a neat guard against the icing from running down the sides.  I found out what the pan was for when I was making some pine nut praline for an ice cream I was going to churn up for her, made by caramelizing 1 part sugar then stirring in 1 part lightly toasted pine nuts, which get spread on a flat, greased surface, and left to cool. In my haste to find a flat pan in an unfamiliar kitchen, I grabbed one Fabrizia’s nice Cassata pans, as I was eyeing its flat, wide surface, perfect for spreading the praline.  I wasn’t able to find where, globally, you can get one online . But I did find some dynamite metal popsicle molds during my search.  Speaking of kitchen tools, I was wowed by this amazing, single-purpose Italian tool. When I asked Fabrizia where she got it, she replied, “In America.”  So somehow, people in the U.S. are able to roll the almond paste to fit snugly into the pan, but not actually find the right pan.  The first thing Fabrizia did was to make her own almond paste using finely ground almonds. Because I am a crunchy-granola California type, I asked if you could make the cake without the green food coloring.  Fabrizia laughed, but being Sicilian, she explained that Cassata is a cake for fun, festive occasions, and the vibrant green is part of the riot of colors that make the cake what it is meant to be. Although, perhaps bowing to overseas sensibilities, her mother, Anna Tasca Lanza said in one of her books that if you leave the green coloring out, you should pour the icing over the entire cake so that it hides the almond paste.  After cutting spongecake into strips to make a top layer for the cake, she whipped up a seriously good ricotta cream with the fresh sheeps’ milk ricotta we’d watched being made just the day before. Since she had a little extra, she tossed the bowl toward me with a spoon, and I dug right in.  Ladies and gentlemen, or signore e signori, no matter how far you are, if you are not booking a ticket to Sicily to taste sweetened sheeps’ milk ricotta cream, may the rest of your life be filled with neutral-colored almond paste.

Forming the two southernmost links in the Caribbean chain, Trinidad and Tobago lie close to the continent of South America , northeast of Venezuela and northwest of Guyana . Trinidad, by far the larger of the two main islands, has an area of about 1,850 square miles (4,800 square km). It is 7 miles (11 km) from the Venezuelan coast at its nearest point and is separated from it by the Gulf of Paria and two narrow channels, where there are several small islands and rocks. Tobago, much smaller, with an area of about 115 square miles (300 square km), lies 20 miles (30 km) to the northeast of Trinidad. Extending diagonally from southwest to northeast, Tobago is about 30 miles (50 km) long and more than 10 miles (16 km) across at its widest point. Little Tobago lies about a mile off Tobago’s northeastern coast.

Other animals include the agouti (a short-haired, short-eared, rabbitlike rodent), quenck (collared peccary; a wild hog), tattoo (an armadillo), prehensile-tailed porcupine, and iguana. Four main groups of reptiles are present on the islands: snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles (one kind, the caiman, related to the alligators). Trinidad’s other indigenous animals include howler monkeys and ocelots, but the latter have disappeared from the wild and the former are rare. In general, the island’s fauna has come under severe stress from rapid urbanization and industrial development.  People  Ethnic groups  The original inhabitants of Trinidad migrated from the Orinoco River delta region of northeastern South America and probably spoke an Arawakan language . It seems likely that by the time the Spanish established a presence there in the 16th century, there was also a population of Cariban speakers, mostly on the north coast.

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.  All four of us went for a ride on the Luas from Milltown to Sandyford and back. During the journey we chatted about the trams as opposed to the buses.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence. Those proceedings have been protracted and sometimes arcane, but Siegel and Shuster’s names were eventually restored to the credits pages of all Superman comics, and Siegel’s heirs were ultimately successful | Question: The rights to which famous character were sold by creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster to Detective Comics for $130 in 1937?', ['superman', 'superman character', 'superman comics'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2367'), ("Context: Australian islands | australia.gov.auAustralian islands | australia.gov.au  Australian islands  Australian islands  World Heritage-listed Fraser Island. Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

President James Garfield planned to leave Washington D.C. around 9:30 in the morning on July 2,  1881 from the Baltimore & Potomac train station.

In  another carriage just behind, followed Garfield\'s two oldest sons, while Lucretia in poor health and still recovering, was resting in a New  Jersey resort and preparing for travel.  Garfield and Secretary Blaine  arrived at the train station and were making their way through the  crowds as Guiteau approached them from behind. Guiteau raised his  gun, aimed, fired and the first shot grazed and stunned the President. He then fired  a second shot that struck the President forcefully and lodged deep into his  back. Garfield slumped to the tile floor, looking on as Guiteau was pounced upon, quickly subdued and arrested. Guiteau requested to be taken to jail at once and he was obliged.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

GK Hart/Vikki Hart/Photodisc/ Getty Images  In all of history, no cow is more infamous than Mrs. O'Leary's. The farm animal was accused of kicking over a lantern and starting the Great Chicago Fire on Oct. 8, 1871. The fire , despite its humble origins in a barn, was ferocious. It destroyed 3.5 square miles of the city and left 120 people dead and thousands more homeless . Losses were estimated at $200 million [source: Gove ].  Mrs. O'Leary lived with her husband and five children at 137 DeKoven Street in Chicago. The O'Learys were a poor family; Mr. O'Leary worked as a laborer, and Mrs. O'Leary kept her infamous cows in a backyard barn and sold their milk to the neighbors.  Up Next  Was there a real John Henry?  After the fire, newspapers immediately pointed fingers at Mrs. O'Leary. The Chicago Tribune claimed that Mrs. O'Leary had a motive for starting the fire. She'd been on welfare, but when the city learned that she sold milk on the side, it cut her off. In response, the peeved Mrs. O'Leary swore her vengeance on the city, the paper claimed. And now she'd had her retribution.  Other newspapers were a bit more gracious. They reported that the fire was an accident -- that a kerosene lamp was knocked over during milking, either by the cow or by Mrs. O'Leary.  Mrs. O'Leary maintained, however, that her entire family was asleep in the house when the fire started. The official inquiry into the fire -- despite its over one thousand pages of testimony -- did not determine the exact cause of the fire. But the damage to Mrs. O'Leary was done, and she and her cow have lived on in Chicago legend.  Historians generally agree that the fire started in the barn behind the O'Leary home. But did the cow really kick over a lantern? Was someone besides Mrs. O'Leary to blame? Several other characters lurk on the edges of this crime scene. Let's take a look at these possible culprits on the next page.  Why did the fire spread so quickly?  Regardless of how the fire started, why weren't the fire fighters able to put it out? In the case of the Chicago fire, it was one heaping of bad luck after another. Chicago was unusually dry that summer, and there was a strong wind on the night of Oct. 8. At the time, about 90 percent of the buildings were constructed of wood, connected by 56 miles of wooden streets and 561 miles of sidewalks [source: Fedler]. For a city of 300,000, there were only 200 firemen. And they have fought a huge fire the night before, which resulted in damaged equipment and exhausted men. Some of the fire engines went to the wrong address. The fire destroyed the building that stored the city's water pumps, and attempts to draw water from Lake Michigan failed. The fire raged through Chicago until burning out the following evening, aided by the first significant rainfall in months.  1  Did Mrs. O'Leary's Cow Start the Great Chicago Fire?Did Mrs. O'Leary's Cow Start the Great Chicago Fire?

A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component.

Unlike tides they are almost constant in their direction and their  velocity fluctuates only by small amounts according to the seasons of the year.  Ocean currents help to  distribute heat around the Earth and circulate massive amounts of warm and cold  water. Ocean current flow rates are measured in Sv units where one Sv is equal  to 1 million m3/s. Two of the fastest flowing ocean currents are the  Florida Current running into the Gulf Stream off the USA  eastern seaboard and the Agulhas current off the south and east coast of  southern Africa.  Florida Current  Beginning in the  Caribbean and ending in the northern North Atlantic, the Florida Current  leading into the Gulf Stream is a north flowing ocean current that reaches  speeds in excess of 2.0m/s, particularly in the Florida Current region closest  to the USA’s  eastern seaboard. The Gulf Stream begins upstream of Cape Hatteras (North  Carolina), where the Florida Current ceases to follow the continental shelf and  heads out into the Atlantic. The transport varies from 30 Sv in the Florida  Current to a maximum of 150 Sv at 55°W in the Gulf Stream.  The most appropriate location for deploying Evopods would be the Florida Current off from Miami where it adheres to the continental shelf in no more than 150m water depth. Extracting 1GW of power (8.8TWh/y) from the Florida Current in the region where it flows at 2m/s would require turbines with an accumulated cross section area of about 1.6M m2 (1500 twin turbine Evopod units each rated at 1500kW) or about 10% of the total flow cross section and would take out 3.3% of the energy from the stream.  Agulhas Current  The Agulhas current flows in a southerly and westerly direction from the Mozambique channel between Africa and Madagascar, down round the south east coast of South Africa past the industrial cities of Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth and eventually interacts with the cold north flowing Benguela current off the southern tip of Africa at Cape Agulhas. The Agulhas current has a volume flow rate of between 70Sv to 85Sv and has a peak speed of about 2m/s in the region off East London.  Extracting 1GW of power (8.8TWh/y) from the Agulhas  Current in the region where it flows at 2m/s would require turbines with an  accumulated cross section area of about 1.6M m2 or about 4% of the  total flow cross section and would take out 1.5% of the energy from the stream.  Much more research is required into this area before it can be confirmed that  it is appropriate for deployment of tidal current devices. However, Eskom, South    Africa’s national utility company has  claimed that the Agulhas current has considerable potential for bulk power  generation and have commissioned studies to investigate routes to exploitation.

Berthing in Nigeria in 1992, this entertainment industry popularly known as Nollywood is acclaimed by industry players to rank as the third largest movie industry in the world after India’s Bollywood and America’s Nollywood. According to movie scholars and critics, Nollywood industry, which despite its relative young emergence in the global movie market has successfully become an enviable artistic cultural vehicle with which African narrative is communicated to the world, ironically emerged as a child of necessity to fill the gap created by the total collapse of the country’s theatre and stage culture.  According to industry sources, the failure of government in providing adequate security surveillance over life and property in the late 80s’and early 90s’resulted in the very negative manner at which the public viewed public shows, especially as it had to do with cinema, stage and theatrical performances with disenchantment.  Video filmartistes at a film shooting site  Also added to this ugly development “was the fact that there were inadequate television stations across the country with enough entertainment contents to satisfy the yearning needs of the viewing public, a development that led\xa0content providers to seek alternative.”  “Nollywood was a child of necessity” says Professor Ahmed Yerima, theatre artiste and former Artistic Director of The National Troupe of Nigeria. He said: “There were very few television stations and we got to a point where the TV stations that existed needed you, the producer, to get sponsorship for your productions.”  Movie-theatre going culture  But for Obby Patrick Ebewo, Nigerian born and American based film scholar, “The collapse of movie-theatre going culture in the 1980s caused by incessant harassment of innocent citizen by criminals, the country’s economic downturn and various problems affecting celluloid film production, gave rise to video film.”  The implication of this new development, according to Yerima, was that fast thinking and business minded entrepreneurs cashed into the opportunity provided by this yearning need; and aided with the arrival of VHS tapes embarked on a business trial and experimentation that was to transform the continent’s entertainment turf.  Prior to this boom, efforts had been made by some dramatists to evolve a film culture in Nigeria. It is on record that as early as the 1960s’ theatre artistes in the mould of Hubert Ogunde, had recorded his plays on celluloid. Other artistes like Moses Adejumo and Duro Ladipo had equally attempted to reduce the cinematic art of film to a more popular medium for social commentary.  In an effort to trace the emergence of Nollywood and the entire film culture in the country, Ebewo argues that “the current video film industry in Nigeria owes a huge debt to the pioneering efforts of Nigerian theatre, particularly practitioners of the Yoruba Travelling theatre, who branched off from mainstream theatre to experiment with celluloid.”  However, the Nollywood brand today owes its projection and commercial resourcefulness to Kenneth Nnebue, who according to market consensus, pioneered the raving popular media brand with his movie, Living in Bondage, in 1992.

Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  Potassium  The name is derived from the english word potash. The chemical symbol K comes from kalium, the Mediaeval Latin for potash, which may have derived from the arabic word qali, meaning alkali.  Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart. Potassium is silvery when first cut but it oxidizes rapidly in air and tarnishes within minutes, so it is generally stored under oil or grease. It is light enough to float into water with which it reacts instantly to release hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame.  The chemistry of potassium is almost etirely that of the potassium ion, K+.  Applications  Most potassium (95 %) goes into fertilizers and the rest goes mainly into making potassium hydroxide (KOH), by the electrolysis of potassium chloride solution, and then converting this to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Potassium carbonate goes into glass manufacture, expecially the glass used to make televisions, while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soaps and detergents. A little potassium chloride goes into pharmaceuticals, medical drips and saline injections.  Other potassium salts are used in baking, photography and tanning leather, and to make iodize salts. In all cases it is the negative anion, not the potassium, which is the key to their use.  Potassium in the environment  Most potassium occurs in the Earth\'s crust as minerals, such as feldspars and clays. Potassium is leached from these by weathering, which explains why there is quite a lot of this element in the sea (0.75 g/liter).  Minerals mined for their potassium are pinkish and sylvite, carnallite and alunite. The main mining area used to be Germany, which had a monopoly of potassium before the first World War. Today most potassium minerals come from Canada, USA and Chile. The world production of potassim ores is about 50 million tonnes, and reserves are vast (more than 10 billion tonnes).  Potassium is a key plant element. Although it is soluble in water, little is lost from undisturbed soils because as it is released from dead plants and animal excrements, it quickly become strongly bound to clay particles, and it is retained ready to be readsorbed by the roots of other plants.  Health effects of potassium  Potassium can be found in vegetables, fruit, potatoes, meat, bread, milk and nuts. It plays an important role in the physical fluid system of humans and it assists nerve functions. Potassium, as the ion K+, concnetrate inside cells, and 95% of the body\'s potassium is so located. When our kidneys are somehow malfunctioning an accumulation of potassium will consist. This can lead to disturbing heartbeats.  Potassium can effect you when breathed in. Inhalation of dust or mists can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, lungs with sneezing, coughing and sore throat. Higher exposures may cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, this can cause death.

It was the most serious scandal in the country’s history prior to the Watergate affair of the Nixon administration in the 1970s.  And this controversy was named for an oil reserve near a rock formation north of Casper , Wyo., that looked just like a teapot.  Events that led to the scandal began decades before when government and U.S. Navy officials, contemplating a new, global presence, realized they needed a fuel supply that was more reliable and more portable than coal .  During the Theodore Roosevelt presidency early in the 20th century, Department of the Navy officials aspired for an American navy that could sail all the world’s oceans, demonstrating the country’s newly found imperial powers. The U. S. Navy, bound by weight limitations with coal-fired ships, resorted to building coal-fueling stations around the world.  They watched carefully as other nations began development of petroleum-powered ships. Beginning in 1909, during the Taft administration, Navy administrators decided to convert the fleet to the more efficient petroleum. Ships would have no need for coaling stations. Once fueled, the petroleum-powered ships had far greater range.  The USS Wyoming , a battleship initially launched in 1900, became the first ship in the fleet to be converted to oil power in 1909. (The vessel was later renamed the USS Cheyenne when the new battleship USS Wyoming was launched in 1910.), As more ships were converted from coal, Navy officials grew more concerned about the long-term availability of oil. What would happen if oil were to run out? The Navy would be paralyzed.  Consequently, Navy administrators asked Congress to set aside federally owned lands in places where known oil deposits most likely existed. These “naval petroleum reserves” would not be drilled unless a national emergency made it necessary. One of the three petroleum reserves set aside was near Salt Creek in northern Natrona County in a place named for an unusual rock formation nearby—Teapot Dome. A dome is a geological formation that traps oil underground between impervious layers of rock, with the upper layer bent upward to form a dome.  Oilmen throughout the West coveted the opportunity to drill within these federally owned reserves. Soon after Republican Warren G. Harding was elected president in 1920, he appointed his poker-playing friend, U.S. Sen. Albert Fall, to be his secretary of Interior.  Fall, a rancher and New Mexico’s first U.S. senator, accepted the cabinet post. Within a few weeks, he convinced President Harding to allow transfer of the naval petroleum reserves from the Navy to the Department of the Interior, arguing that the department was “better able” to oversee the protection of these areas where oil was not to be produced, but kept in case of emergency.  What resulted became known as the Teapot Dome scandal, but even though the scandal gained its name from a Wyoming place, the wrongdoers were from elsewhere.  Secretary Fall, once the Teapot Dome oil field was under his control, made secret deals with two prominent oilmen, Edward Doheny and Harry Sinclair. Both men, close friends of Fall, paid him bribes to authorize them to drill in the three naval petroleum reserves—contrary to the letter and spirit of the law.  Back in Wyoming, independent oilman and later, Democratic Wyoming Gov. Leslie Miller became suspicious when he saw trucks with the Sinclair company logo hauling drilling equipment into the Teapot Dome naval petroleum reserve. He asked U.S. Sen. John B. Kendrick , also a Democrat, to look into the matter. Kendrick, sensing wrongdoing, turned the question over to a special Senate investigating committee.  Meanwhile, President Harding took a summer trip west, stopping in Wyoming, enjoying Yellowstone and continuing on to Alaska and, eventually, to San Francisco. While there, the President died suddenly. Some historians believe Harding escaped impeachment for his role in Teapot Dome by having the | Question: The administration of which American President was rocked by the 'Teapot Dome Scandal' of the 1920's?", ['president harding'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6423'), ('Context: General Blood  General Blood is a FDA registered and AABB accredited distributor of human blood, platelets, and plasma for hospitals, non-transfusion facilities, and group-purchasing organizations.

The year? Any time between the Dark Ages and the 18th century. You have sent your holy relics on a road trip to raise money for a new abbey church. But the best stone for your new church lies over 100 miles away. A hundred miles over roads that are impassable in wet weather and beset by brigands. How do you transport the building materials you need?  A canal aquaduct over the Irwell  The river solution  By river, that\'s how. Until the 18th century most heavy goods were transported within Britain by river. And it isn\'t hard to see why. A healthy horse could pull a cart laden with two tons. That same horse could pull a river barge weighing one hundred tons. But by Tudor times the navigable rivers were gradually silting up. Several acts of Parliament were passed to keep the rivers clean, but by the 18th century the rivers could not keep up with the demands of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. It was time for a change, and canals provided that change.  The Canal solution  The most influential early canal was built by the Duke of Bridgewater in 1759 to carry coal from his mines at Worsely to Manchester. The Duke\'s engineer, James Brindley, became the \'pop star\' of the canal set, and for the next dozen years he was in constant demand to create canals for other entrepreneurs.  Towpaths and locks  Many of these early canals were powered by men, who pulled the barges with ropes from the banks. Later, towpaths were built beside the canals to allow horses to do the work. Most canals simply joined rivers or navigable streams. To counter changes in water levels between these rivers, locks were used, sometimes in flights (there is a flight of 30 at Tardebrigge on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal and 29 at Devizes on the Kennet and Avon).  A traditional narrowboat at  Stoke Bruerne, Northamptonshire  Narrowboats  One of the major difficulties of canal transport was that there were no standards. Canals were built by individual entrepreneurs to take local goods, and each canal was built to its own width and depth. Boats from one area could not fit the canals in another area. To keep costs down many canals were built with locks only 7 feet wide, and the boats just 6 inches narrower than that. These 6\'6" boats are the classic British "narrowboats" that we still see today.  The death of canals... and revival  Railways killed the canals. By the late 1800\'s canals were no longer viable, and many fell into disuse. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in canals for pleasure use. Vacationers in search of the slow lane can rent a narrowboat (don\'t worry, they are very easy to pilot) or stay on a hotel boat for a leisurely cruise - top speed 4 mph! One of the pleasures of canal travel are the lock keeper\'s cottages. It was traditional for lock keepers to try to outdo each other in creating beautiful gardens; there is now a national competition for the best lock-keeper\'s cottage garden.  Canals to visit  A few of the major canals you may wish to visit include Regent\'s Canal in London, the Kennet and Avon, the Shropshire Union, and the Grand Union Canal, among dozens of others. And here\'s one final tidbit of canal trivia you can use as an ice-breaker at your next party : there are more miles of canals in Birmingham than in Venice! Remember, you heard it here first.

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ('Context: Wrigley FieldWrigley Field is a baseball park on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States, which is the home of the Chicago Cubs, one of the city\'s two Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises.  Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: Oktoberfest - TourRadarOktoberfest - TourRadar  Oktoberfest  Tours starting from USD $96  Germany  What customers say about Oktoberfest  4.5 / 5  Based on 65 reviews  About  Oktoberfest is the world’s largest beer festival, drawing over 6 million people a year to Munich, Germany for the Bavarian beer-drinking festivities. The grand event takes place at the famous “Theresienwiese” field where large tents are constructed over a three month period that begins in the summer.\xa0  Oktoberfest dates back to the marriage celebration of Prince Ludwig to Princess Therese in 1810. On this special day, the people of Munich were invited to participate in the celebration which was held for five days on the fields in front of the city gates. What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair. From that day on, the festivities have continued more or less on an annual basis (outside of the 24 times it was canceled due to war and cholera).\xa0  "What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair."\xa0  Over the decades, the festival has evolved into an elaborate affair spanning from late September to early October. Oktoberfest 2016 will commence on September 17th and run through October 3rd, totalling 17 days of beer-drinking Bavarian shenanigans.\xa0  \xa0  Oktoberfest Must Sees and Dos  All About the Tents  Entry into Oktoberfest is free! You may enter both the festival and tents free of charge (with the exception of the “Historical Wies’n” which requires a small fee). Oktoberfest showcases 14 spectacular tents with 1,000 - 8,500 seats which are owned by various restaurants, breweries and other establishments. There are also a number of smaller tents and beer gardens in the vicinity.\xa0  All tents are unique and have their own charm, so if you have the time, we recommend trying to check them all out! The tents serve Bavarian beers, traditional eats, and are booming with live music throughout the day and night. Music performances are comprised of a mix of both traditional Bavarian music and contemporary bands playing later in the evenings.\xa0  While it’s possible to visit all of the tents, the issue is whether or not you can get a seat, especially on weekends and during bad weather. Although tents do offer reservations, they can be next to impossible to get. Reservations are typically given to large German companies and groups, and the tents always serve their existing customers from previous years first.\xa0  The remaining requests are put on a daunting waiting list; nonetheless, it’s still worth a shot! If you’re travelling in a small group of 2 or 3, you can patiently wait until someone leaves, and then quickly grab their table. And if it’s a pretty crowded day, you’ll be better off remaining at the table instead of venturing off to another tent where you’ll likely meet another long wait. Note that tents will be closed if they become too full, and will be re-opened later when more space is available. For a map and details on the fourteen tents, check out Oktoberfest’s Tent Guide with photos and descriptions of each tent.  Beer & Other Beverages  The Oktoberfest beer is by far the event’s most popular attraction. Large one liter beers are served in traditional German “Maß” mugs. The Club of Munich Brewers maintains strict regulations on exactly which brands of beer can be served at the festival. There are currently only 6 breweries whose beer meets the criteria. In doing so they must adhere to the Bavarian Purity Laws established for beer brewing in 1487 and the beers must be brewed within Munich city limits. Check out more details on the breweries here .\xa0  At the 2015 festival alone, a whopping 7.7 million liters of beer were consumed. A typical beer costs between €9.70 and €10.10 and is sold in the tents between the hours of 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. during the weekdays and between 9 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters.

As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her.

When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .

However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school.

Unlike tides they are almost constant in their direction and their  velocity fluctuates only by small amounts according to the seasons of the year.  Ocean currents help to  distribute heat around the Earth and circulate massive amounts of warm and cold  water. Ocean current flow rates are measured in Sv units where one Sv is equal  to 1 million m3/s. Two of the fastest flowing ocean currents are the  Florida Current running into the Gulf Stream off the USA  eastern seaboard and the Agulhas current off the south and east coast of  southern Africa.  Florida Current  Beginning in the  Caribbean and ending in the northern North Atlantic, the Florida Current  leading into the Gulf Stream is a north flowing ocean current that reaches  speeds in excess of 2.0m/s, particularly in the Florida Current region closest  to the USA’s  eastern seaboard. The Gulf Stream begins upstream of Cape Hatteras (North  Carolina), where the Florida Current ceases to follow the continental shelf and  heads out into the Atlantic. The transport varies from 30 Sv in the Florida  Current to a maximum of 150 Sv at 55°W in the Gulf Stream.  The most appropriate location for deploying Evopods would be the Florida Current off from Miami where it adheres to the continental shelf in no more than 150m water depth. Extracting 1GW of power (8.8TWh/y) from the Florida Current in the region where it flows at 2m/s would require turbines with an accumulated cross section area of about 1.6M m2 (1500 twin turbine Evopod units each rated at 1500kW) or about 10% of the total flow cross section and would take out 3.3% of the energy from the stream.  Agulhas Current  The Agulhas current flows in a southerly and westerly direction from the Mozambique channel between Africa and Madagascar, down round the south east coast of South Africa past the industrial cities of Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth and eventually interacts with the cold north flowing Benguela current off the southern tip of Africa at Cape Agulhas. The Agulhas current has a volume flow rate of between 70Sv to 85Sv and has a peak speed of about 2m/s in the region off East London.  Extracting 1GW of power (8.8TWh/y) from the Agulhas  Current in the region where it flows at 2m/s would require turbines with an  accumulated cross section area of about 1.6M m2 or about 4% of the  total flow cross section and would take out 1.5% of the energy from the stream.  Much more research is required into this area before it can be confirmed that  it is appropriate for deployment of tidal current devices. However, Eskom, South    Africa’s national utility company has  claimed that the Agulhas current has considerable potential for bulk power  generation and have commissioned studies to investigate routes to exploitation.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] | Question: What is another term for rotors?", ['rotating discs'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3467'), ("Context: Daphne Du maurier - Rebecca First Edition | Bauman Rare BooksDaphne Du maurier - Rebecca First Edition | Bauman Rare Books  Daphne DU MAURIER  Item#: 82163 We're sorry, this item has been sold  “PERHAPS THE GREATEST ROMANTIC SUSPENSE NOVEL EVER WRITTEN”: FIRST EDITION OF REBECCA, WITH SCARCE DUST JACKET AND BELLY BAND  DU MAURIER, Daphne.

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva.

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts.  The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region.  The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. While some of the northern outposts of Aragon are inaccessible in winter because of snow, the region is, on the whole, fairly dry, enjoying a humid, Mediterranean-style climate in many areas.  Like most of Spain, Aragon was under the domination of the Moors from the 8th to the 14th centuries. However, many Muslims decided to remain in Aragon after the Christian Re-conquest, resulting in a style of architecture that is unique to Aragon.  Mudejar – meaning “those who are allowed to stay” – is a form of architecture employing bricks, plaster and the repetitive geometric patterns characteristic of early Islamic art. The buildings are finished off with ceramic tiles. The city of Teruel and the town of Calatayud are home to some of the best examples of Mudejar architecture.  Aragon may be best known for the marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla in 1469, which effectively created modern Spain. Their youngest daughter, Katherine of Aragon, became the first queen of Henry VIII of England.  Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in Spain, and funded Christopher Columbus’ expedition to America in 1492. For these accomplishments, they were dubbed “The Catholic Monarchs” by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. Everywhere in Aragon, there are reminders of the long, colorful history of Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign.  Abiding traditions  Aragon is steeped in tradition, and bull fighting and bull running play a major part in Aragonese culture. Most towns and villages hold some sort of bull festival in September; people who have issues with the ethics of bull fighting may be uncomfortable living in a region where the traditional is such an intrinsic part of local culture.  Aragon is also famous for the Jota, an energetic 17th-century dance particular to the region. While the flamenco, which originated in Andalucia, is now performed all over Spain, the Jota remains the proud possession of Aragonese culture. Both men and women perform the Jota, which involves a lot of noise and leaping around.  Moving to Aragon  Aragon has a population of around 1.3 million, of which over 10%, or about 173,000, are foreigners.  These come from all over the world, as there is significant foreign investment in the region. General Motors, Bosch Siemens and Adidas all have major plants in Aragon.  Property prices in Aragon are very competitive. On average, houses in Aragon are 56% cheaper than the national average.  Away from the regional capital of Zaragoza, which houses more than half of the region’s population, Aragon is sparsely populated. There are only two other cities– Teruel and Huesca – in all of Aragon. For those who want to get away from it all, Aragon is the place to do it.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

LAKE DISTRICT, in England, a district containing all the principal English lakes, and variously termed the Lake Country, Lakeland and " the Lakes." It falls within the north-western counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire (Furness district), about one-half being within the first of these. Although celebrated far outside the confines of Great Britain as a district of remarkable and strongly individual physical beauty, its area is only some 700 sq. m., a circle with radius of 15 M. from the central point covering practically the whole. Within this circle, besides the largest lake, Windermere, is the highest point in England, Scafell Pike; yet Windermere is but roe m. in length, and covers an area of 5.69 sq. m., while Scafell Pike is only 3210 ft. in height. But the lakes show a wonderful variety of character, from open expanse and steep rock-bound shores to picturesque island-groups and soft wooded banks; while the mountains have always a remarkable dignity, less from the profile of their summits than from the bold sweeping lines of their flanks, unbroken by vegetation, and often culminating in sheer cliffs or crags. At their feet, the flat green valley floors of the higher elevations give place in the lower parts to lovely woods. The streams are swift and clear, and numerous small waterfalls are characteristic of the district. To the north, west and south, a flat coastal belt, bordering the Irish Sea, with its inlets Morecambe Bay and Solway Firth, and broadest in the north, marks off the Lake District, while to the east the valleys of the Eden and the Lune divide it from the Pennine mountain system. Geologically, too, it is individual. Its centre is of volcanic rocks, complex in character, while the Coal-measures and New Red Sandstone appear round the edges. The district as a whole is grooved by a main depression, running from north to south along the valleys of St John, Thirlmere, Grasmere\' and Windermere, . surmounting a pass (Dunmail Raise) of only 783 ft.; while a secondary depression, in the same direction, runs along Derwentwater, Borrowdale, Wasdale and Wastwater, but here Sty Head Pass, between Borrowdale and Wasdale, rises to 1600 ft. The centre of the 15-m. radius lies on the lesser heights between Langstrath and Dunmail Raise, which may, however, be the crown of an ancient dome of rocks, " the dissected skeleton of which, worn by the warfare of air and rain and ice, now alone remains " (Dr H. R.. Mill, " Bathymetrical Survey of the English Lakes," Geographical Journal, vi. 48). The principal features of the district may be indicated by following this circle round from north, by west, south and east. The river. Derwent (q.v.), rising in the tarns and " gills " or ghylls " (small streams running in deeply-grooved clefts) north of Sty Head Pass and the Scafell mass flows north through the wooded Borrowdale and forms Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite. These two lakes are in a class apart from all the rest, being broader for their length, and quite shallow (about 18 ft. average and 70 ft. maximum), as distinct from the long, narrow and deep troughs occupied by the other chief lakes, which average from 40 to 135 ft. deep. Derwentwater (q.v.), studded with many islands, is perhaps the most beautiful of all. Borrowdale is joined on the east by the bare wild dale of Langstrath, and the Greta joins the Derwent immediately below Derwentwater; the town of Keswick lying near the junction.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring.

Today’s History  Australis: Museum VictoriaAustralis: Museum Victoria  Propulsion: Reduction geared steam turbines / twin screws  Shipping Line: Chandris Line  History of the Ship  Originally named America, the immigrant ship Australis was designed by William Francis Gibbs and built for the North Atlantic trade – to travel between Europe and the United States. When launched on 31 August 1939 (by Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt), she was the largest passenger vessel to have ever been constructed in the United States and provided luxury accommodation for 1202 passengers in three classes.  In the midst of World War II, she was taken over by the US Navy and converted to an American troop ship capable of carrying 8175 soldiers. Realising the impact on public sentiment should America be sunk, the American government quickly renamed the ship the USS West Point. During the war, she visited ports in Europe, Africa and South America and was frequently attacked by Japanese forces.  After 12 years on the North Atlantic trade following the war, she was sold to the Chandris Line in 1965 and christened Australis, being converted to a fully air conditioned single class ship for the Australian migrant trade. A large portion of her original interior styling was maintained, and she remained adorned with many murals and Art Deco floor coverings during her immigration years.  Immigrant Ship to Australia  The Australis left Piraeus, Greece, for her first immigrant voyage to Australia on 21 August 1965, reaching Fremantle on 6 September and Melbourne on 13 September. She made a total of 62 voyages to Australia between 1965 and 1977, travelling regularly between Britain and Australia via the Suez Canal, stopping at ports such as Aden, Port Said and Colombo. In 1967, when the Suez was closed, she detoured around South Africa stopping at Cape Town and Durban. In 1970, while travelling between New Zealand and Suva, a fire broke out in the galley causing substantial damage, not only to the galley, but also to the ballroom and 40 cabins.  Passenger Experiences of the Journey  In the later years of the immigration boom, Australia saw many younger, single immigrants arriving with high expectations and a sense of adventure. At this time, the journey by ship was like a holiday for some passengers.  Gisela Pfab migrated from Germany in 1970:  'I was single and it turned out I had a lot of company on the boat. Soon we partied every night and didn't get to bed until in the early morning. As a result we missed our English classes most of the time.'  For others, the journey on the Australis was a pathway to freedom from political upheaval in their home country and the beginning of a new life.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

There is little doubt that Stevenson would have liked solemnly to don the black cap and sentence them to the end he believed they richly deserved  -  dangling, necks broken, from a rope after a 9am walk to the gallows at Wandsworth or Pentonville.

It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to \'drive forward its work\', but it does not itself \'legislative functions\'.

The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.

Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  Potassium  The name is derived from the english word potash. The chemical symbol K comes from kalium, the Mediaeval Latin for potash, which may have derived from the arabic word qali, meaning alkali.  Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart. Potassium is silvery when first cut but it oxidizes rapidly in air and tarnishes within minutes, so it is generally stored under oil or grease. It is light enough to float into water with which it reacts instantly to release hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame.  The chemistry of potassium is almost etirely that of the potassium ion, K+.  Applications  Most potassium (95 %) goes into fertilizers and the rest goes mainly into making potassium hydroxide (KOH), by the electrolysis of potassium chloride solution, and then converting this to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Potassium carbonate goes into glass manufacture, expecially the glass used to make televisions, while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soaps and detergents. A little potassium chloride goes into pharmaceuticals, medical drips and saline injections.  Other potassium salts are used in baking, photography and tanning leather, and to make iodize salts. In all cases it is the negative anion, not the potassium, which is the key to their use.  Potassium in the environment  Most potassium occurs in the Earth\'s crust as minerals, such as feldspars and clays. Potassium is leached from these by weathering, which explains why there is quite a lot of this element in the sea (0.75 g/liter).  Minerals mined for their potassium are pinkish and sylvite, carnallite and alunite. The main mining area used to be Germany, which had a monopoly of potassium before the first World War. Today most potassium minerals come from Canada, USA and Chile. The world production of potassim ores is about 50 million tonnes, and reserves are vast (more than 10 billion tonnes).  Potassium is a key plant element. Although it is soluble in water, little is lost from undisturbed soils because as it is released from dead plants and animal excrements, it quickly become strongly bound to clay particles, and it is retained ready to be readsorbed by the roots of other plants.  Health effects of potassium  Potassium can be found in vegetables, fruit, potatoes, meat, bread, milk and nuts. It plays an important role in the physical fluid system of humans and it assists nerve functions. Potassium, as the ion K+, concnetrate inside cells, and 95% of the body\'s potassium is so located. When our kidneys are somehow malfunctioning an accumulation of potassium will consist. This can lead to disturbing heartbeats.  Potassium can effect you when breathed in. Inhalation of dust or mists can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, lungs with sneezing, coughing and sore throat. Higher exposures may cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, this can cause death.

Did Davy Crockett Die in Battle at the Alamo?:  On March 6, 1836, Mexican forces stormed the Alamo, a fortress-like old mission in San Antonio where some 200 rebellious Texans had been holed up for weeks. The battle was over in less than two hours, leaving great Texas heroes like Jim Bowie, James Butler Bonham and William Travis dead. Among the defenders that day was Davy Crockett, former Congressman and legendary hunter, scout and teller of tall-tales. According to some accounts, Crockett died in battle and according to others, he was one of a handful of men captured and later executed. What really happened?  Davy Crockett:  Davy Crockett (1786-1836) was born in Tennessee, then a frontier territory. He was a hard working young man who distinguished himself as a scout in the Creek War and provided food for his whole regiment by hunting. Initially a supporter of Andrew Jackson , he was elected to Congress in 1827. He fell out with Jackson, however, and in 1835 lost his seat in Congress.  continue reading below our video  10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don\'t Know  By this time, Crockett was famous for his tall tales and folksy speeches. He felt it was time to take a break from politics and decided to visit Texas.  Crockett Arrives at the Alamo:  Crockett made his way slowly to Texas. Along the way, he learned that there was much sympathy for the Texans in the USA. Many men were heading there to fight and people assumed Crockett was, too: he didn\'t contradict them. He crossed into Texas in early 1836. Learning that the fighting was taking place near San Antonio , he headed there. He arrived at the Alamo in February. By then, Rebel leaders such as Jim Bowie and William Travis were preparing a defense. Bowie and Travis did not get along: Crockett, ever the skilled politician, defused the tension between them.  Crockett at the Battle of the Alamo:  Crockett had arrived with a handful of volunteers from Tennessee. These frontiersmen were lethal with their long rifles and they were a welcome addition to the defenders. The Mexican army arrived in late February and laid siege to the Alamo. Mexican General Santa Anna did not immediately seal the exits from San Antonio and the defenders could have escaped had they wished: they chose to remain. The Mexicans attacked at dawn on March 6 and within two hours the Alamo was overrun .  Was Crockett taken Prisoner?:  Here’s where things get unclear. Historians agree on a few basic facts: some 600 Mexicans and 200 Texans died that day. A handful – most say seven – of Texan defenders were taken alive. These men were swiftly put to death by orders of Mexican General Santa Anna. According to some sources, Crockett was among them, and according to others, he was not. What’s the truth? There are several sources that should be considered.  Fernando Urissa:  The Mexicans were crushed at the Battle of San Jacinto about six weeks later. One of the Mexican\xa0 prisoners was a young officer named Fernando Urissa. Urissa was wounded, and treated by Dr. Nicholas Labadie, who kept a journal. Labadie asked about the Battle of the Alamo, and Urissa mentioned the capture of a "venerable-looking man" with a red face: he believed the others called him "Coket." The prisoner was brought to Santa Anna and then executed, shot by several soldiers at once.  Francisco Antonio Ruiz:  Francisco Antonio Ruiz, the mayor of San Antonio, was safely behind the Mexican lines when the battle began and had a good vantage point to witness what happened.

Note: At the beginning of the story of Hagar, Sarah and Abraham are called Sarai and Abram; later in the story, God makes a promise to them, a covenant, and changes their names to Sarah and Abraham. To minimize confusion,\xa0‘Sarah’ and ‘Abraham’ are used throughout.  Main themes of the story  Nothing is impossible to God. God had promised Abraham he would be the father of many nations, so when Sarah became post-menopausal she looked for ways to make this happen. She did not trust in God enough to leave the matter in His hands.  The foundation of the Arab nations.  According to the Koran, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael were ancestors of the Arab nations, and of the prophet Mohammed. The Koran says it was at Mecca that God saved Hagar and her son from death by thirst. Muslim ritual reflects this: every year for thirteen centuries Muslims performing the Hajj have retraced Hagar’s steps as she desperately searched for water.  Hagar represents women in the Bible who are excluded or despised. This might happen because they are childless in a society that valued mothers (as Sarah was at first) or a slave in a hierarchical society (as Hagar was at first).  Mother and beloved child  The story has two episodes:  1 The conception and birth of Hagar’s son Ishmael ( Genesis 16:1-16 ). Hagar was an Egyptian slave girl in the tribe of Abraham. She belonged to Sarah, the alpha female of the tribe. When Sarah could not conceive she gave Hagar to her husband as a surrogate. Hagar became pregnant, and God promised that her child would be the ancestor of a great nation. She bore a son, Ishmael.  2 The expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael ( Genesis 21:1-21 ). Hagar was never fully accepted into the tribe despite being the mother of Abraham’s child, and in the end she was rejected completely and expelled into the desert. But God protected her twice from Sarah’s hatred by sending an angel, and eventually Hagar lived as a free woman, not a slave.  See MAPS OF BIBLE LANDS for the location of this story  Hagar —\xa0victim? or upwardly mobile?  Read Genesis 16:1-16  The story of Hagar took place during the late Bronze Age between 2000 and 1550BC, corresponding to the Middle Kingdom period in Egyptian history.  Hagar was an Egyptian girl who was a slave in the household of Sarah, a Hebrew princess. Sarah may have acquired Hagar as part of the generous bride-price paid to her husband Abraham by Pharaoh in Egypt (this story is in Genesis 12:10-20 ).  Ancient wall painting of beautiful Egyptian women  It was an accepted practice at the time to give servants and slaves as part of the dowry of a wealthy young woman. If Hagar was a gift from Pharaoh, she was probably an accomplished servant with valuable skills. Becoming the servant of a nomadic tribeswoman may have been a step down socially for her.  You might take a look at Egyptian love poems in Women in the Bible: the story of Potiphar’s Wife: it will give you some idea of the comparative sophistication of the Egyptians.  Hagar was always disadvantaged among the Hebrew women because she was a foreigner and a slave. This was ironic, since she came from a land that was socially and politically advanced and possessed cities, temples and elaborate burial sites. Egypt had a complex economic system that regulated trade and commerce throughout its empire, and its theology and religion were sophisticated and well ordered.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941.

He\'d produced hits for the Turtles (" It Ain\'t Me Babe ") and the Association (" Windy "); he\'d been a personal guest of Lou Adler at the Monterey Pop Festival where he was perhaps the only West Coast guy in attendance to appreciate Laura Nyro\'s gruesome performance. Later he delivered Laura\'s "Stoned Soul Picnic" to the 5th Dimension, for which it was their biggest r&b hit. He was shuttling back and forth between his home in L.A. and the studio in New York working on the vocals for the Stoned Soul Picnic album when the group told him they wanted to do "Aquarius."  "The thing that bothered me about it was that there\'d been other releases of \'Aquarius,\'" said Bones, "and none had done anything, so I was concerned about what we would do that would be any different. I went to see the show and there\'s a place where they do "The Flesh Failures" and at the end of the song is just a three bar repeated thing of \'Let the sunshine in\' where Ragni was swinging across the stage on a chandelier and there was all kinds of craziness going on. That really stayed with me and I came out of the theater saying, I wonder if I could stick that on the end of \'Aquarius\' and make that the ending. So I went back to the hotel and I called the publisher. I mean you don\'t mess with the music from a Broadway show. I started my professional career in 1956 and I knew a lot about what you can and what you can\'t do with songs. I said, look the 5th Dimension would like to record \'Aquarius,\' but I\'d like to make it a medley and I\'d like to use the last three bars of \'The Flesh Failures\' and I don\'t want to do it without permission. So he said okay, you can go ahead and do it."  The next problem was to go ahead and do it. "The record was plotted in the fall of \'68 and more or less finished in January of \'69," Bones said. "I had to do a lot of work with my vocal arranger, Bob Alsivar. Because they couldn\'t sing both songs in the same key, we had to do a modulation; we figured out how I was going to do the instrumental arrangement so we could change keys. The record itself is the result of a conglomeration of things. I began as a jazz musician and I know the standard repertoire pretty well. I kept thinking about a song called \'Lost in the Stars\' and trying to find something to give you that kind of impression.

He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797.  In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.  Notes by Lesley Young  WALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The) - naxos.comWALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The)  The Castle of Otranto  \xa0  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister. He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797. In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, | Question: 'The Castle of Otranto' often called the first gothic novel, was written in 1764 by whom?", ['horace walpole'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4725'), ('Context: Horus , the God of Kings in Ancient EgyptHorus, the God of Kings in Ancient Egypt  Contact Us  About us  Tour Egypt aims to offer the ultimate Egyptian adventure and intimate knowledge about the country.

Horus, the God of Kings in Ancient Egypt  Horus, the God of Kings  by Jimmy Dunn  From the very earliest of times, the falcon seems to have been worshipped in Egypt as representative of the greatest cosmic powers. Many falcon gods existed throughout Egypt, though over time, a good number of these assimilated to Horus , the most important of the avian deities. Yet, from all his of many forms, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the "true" Horus. Horus is mostly a general term for a great number of falcon deities.  Horus is one of ancient Egypt\'s best known gods , as well as one of its oldest. His name is attested to from at least the beginning of the Dynastic Period , and depictions of falcon deities on earlier artifacts, such as the Narmer Palette, probably represent this same god. The Turin Canon, which provides some of our most important information on Egypt\'s early history, specifically describes the Predynastic rulers of Egypt as "Followers of Horus".  The use of his name was also widespread in personal names throughout Egyptian history, and Hor, as a personal name, survives into our modern era in a number                   of different forms.  Forms of Horus  Horus is a complicated deity, appearing in many different forms and his mythology is one of the most extensive of all Egyptian deities. Indeed, he has so many different aspects that we must limit our discussion to those that are significant. At the same time, a judicious examination of the various Horuses and the sources relating to them supports the possibility that the roles in question are closely interrelated, and so they may be understood as different aspects of the same divine persona.  The original form of Horus was probably that of a sky god, known as "lord of the sky". The Egyptian word " her" (hor, har), from which the god\'s name is derived means "the one on high", or "the distant one", probably in reference to the soaring flight of the hunting falcon, if not a reference to the solar aspect of the god. Mythologically, the god was imagined as a celestial falcon, whose right eye was the sun and left eye the moon. The speckled feathers of his breast were probably considered to be the stars, while his wings were the sky that created the wind. In this form, Horus was apparently worshipped at some of Egypt\'s earliest shrines such as at Nekhen (Heirakonpolis) , where he was assimilated with a number of other local falcon gods. In this capacity, Horus was the patron of the Nekhen monarchy that grew into the historical pharaonic state and hence, the first known national god.  A natural outgrowth of his role as "lord of the sky" was his aspect as a sun god. An ivory comb of the 1st Dynasty king Den depicts a falcon in a boat riding on outstretched wings, suggesting the falcon traversing the sky as the sun god. The early Pyramid Texts specifically refer to him in solar terms as "god of the east", and he  appears in at least three forms in this guise.  As Horakhty (Harakhty), or "Horus of the two horizons", Horus was the god of the rising and setting sun, but more particularly the god of the east and the sunrise. In the Pyramid Texts , the deceased king is said to be reborn in the eastern sky as Horakhty. Eventually, Horakhty became a part of the Heliopolis sun cult and was fused with its solar god as Re-Horakhty .

What is the History of Fleet Street?  charlesdickenspage.com  Main Image:\xa0  Fleet Street is the name of a popular street in London that was once the centre of British Press and Journalism. Up till the 1980s most of the Offices of the British press was housed on Fleet Street. Today many media agencies have moved out of Fleet Street but the Street continues to represent the British Press. The Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. The tube stations nearest to Fleet Street are Chancery Lane, Temple and Blackfriars. There are many streets in London which may surpass the Fleet Street in its architectural design but the Fleet Street is regarded historically as one of London’s important streets.  Content  \xa0  What is the Etymology of Fleet Street?  The name Fleet Street is derived from the name of River Fleet that is now an underground stream. Fleet street once had all the important newspaper offices almost till the 1980.s However by 2005 the last of the British press agencies, the Reuters left Fleet Sreet. The Street is so strongly linked with British Journalists that even now it is used synonymously for the British Press.  \xa0  \xa0  What is the History of Fleet Street?\xa0  The use of the name Fleet Street can be dated back to the 13th century when it was known as Fleet Bridge Street. Around the 14th century the Street came to be known by its present usage. Publishing began in Fleet Street with the setting up of a printing shop by Wynkyn de Worde,apprentice to William Caxton. Around the same time, Richard Pynson set up his publishing and printing office near St. Dunstan’s Church. This was followed by a number of other publishers and printers with The Daily Courant-London;s first daily paper setting up its premises on Fleet Street in March 1702.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  Where is Fleet Street Located?\xa0  The Street named as Fleet Street started from the City of London and extended till WestmininserThe Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. In former times the River Fleet acted like the boundary of the medieval city of London,enforced by walls to ward off any foreign invasions. The construction of the Fleet Street in the city London marked the expansion of London in the early 14th century. While the River Fleet flowed at the East end of the street,the West end is marked by the Temple Bar ,setting the city limits. To the south of the Fleet Street lies The Temple, which is a complex of buildings formerly owned by the Knights Templar.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  What is the Status of the Present Day Fleet Street?

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

The first blood transfusions were also attempted around this time, although these were often unsuccessful and proved fatal in humans.  The first successful blood transfusion recorded was performed by British physician Richard Lower in 1665 when he bled a dog almost to death and then revived the animal by transfusing blood from another dog via a tied artery.  In 1667, Jean-Baptiste Denis who was physician to King Louis XIV, performed the transfusion of blood from an animal to a human. Denis transfused the blood from a sheep to a 15-year old boy and later to a labourer, both of whom survived the transfusions.  Related Stories  Zika virus infection can break down and damage testes of male mice, new research shows  In 1818, British obstetrician James Blundell successfully transfused human blood to a patient who had hemorrhaged during childbirth. In 1901, Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian physician discovered the first human blood groups, which helped transfusion to become a safer practice. By performing experiments in which he mixed blood samples taken from his staff, Landsteiner discovered blood groups A, B and O and established the basic principals of ABO compatibility. In 1907, an American surgeon called Reuben Ottenberg suggested that patient and donor blood should be grouped and cross matched before a blood transfusion procedure.  Between 1914 and 1918, anticoagulants such as sodium citrate were found to prolong the shelf life of blood and refrigeration also proved to be an effective means of preserving blood. In the 1920’s and 30’s, the voluntary donation of blood for storage and use was started. At around the same time, Edwin Cohn developed cold ethanol fractionation, a method of breaking down blood into its component parts to obtain albumin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen, for example.  During the Second World War, blood transfusion was used on a large scale to treat injured soldiers and became well known as a life saving procedure.  “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human ...Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″ | BRANCH  Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″  Abstract  The first experiments in blood transfusion took place in the seventeenth century, using blood drawn from animals. After the death of a French patient and the trial of his physician for manslaughter, transfusion was abandoned for a century and a half. When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth. During the course of the century, transfusion was applied as a remedy to different kinds of sicknesses and injuries, and performed at different times with various fluids. By the 1880s, British doctors had abandoned transfusion with blood in favor of infusion with saline solution; the practice was only again resumed after the recognition of human blood types in the twentieth century. Developments in the practice of transfusion and infusion during the century reflect shifting views of how gender and species identity are embodied, and of relations of affinity and immunity between bodies of different kinds. They also reflect a shift from a vitalist to a mechanist understanding of blood and its function.  Download this page in PDF format  Blood transfusion as a medical practice dates to the seventeenth century; [1] > the first experiments were performed a few decades after William Harvey published his demonstration that blood circulates in the body in De Motu Cordis (1628).\xa0 Harvey’s discovery showed that blood circulated indefinitely, rather than being either consumed within the body or expelled from it. To cure pathologies of the blood was thus no longer exclusively a matter of stimulating or preventing its evacuation; now the goal was to affect blood’s circulation within the body and its interaction with other organs. The earliest blood transfusions involving human subjects were carried out almost simultaneously in France and England in 1667.

The space telescope, conceived in the 1940s, designed in the 1970s, and built in the 1980s, was designed to give astronomers an unparalleled view of the solar system, the galaxy, and the universe. Initially, Hubble’s operators suffered a setback when a lens aberration was discovered, but a repair mission by space-walking astronauts in December 1993 successfully fixed the problem, and Hubble began sending back its first breathtaking images of the universe.  Free of atmospheric distortions, Hubble has a resolution 10 times that of ground-based observatories. About the size of a bus, the telescope is solar-powered and orbits Earth once every 97 minutes.  Among its many astronomical achievements, Hubble has been used to record a comet’s collision with Jupiter, provide a direct look at the surface of Pluto, view distant galaxies, gas clouds, and black holes, and see billions of years into the universe’s past.

Fact Sheet  The Hubble Space Telescope is a joint ESA/NASA project and was launched in 1990 by the Space Shuttle mission STS-31 into a low-Earth orbit 569 km above the ground. During its lifetime Hubble has become one of the most important science projects ever.  Mission Objectives  Hubble's orbit above the Earth's distorting atmosphere allows astronomers to make the very high resolution observations that are essential to open new windows onto planets , stars and galaxies. Hubble was designed as a high standard flagship mission and has paved the way for other space-based observatories. Notably it can access the otherwise invisible ultraviolet part of the spectrum, and also has access to areas of the infrared not visible from the ground.  Mission Name  The Hubble Space Telescope is named after Edwin Powell Hubble (1889-1953) who was one of the great pioneers of modern astronomy.  Spacecraft  Design: At the heart of Hubble are a 2.4 m primary mirror and a collection of five science instruments that work across the entire optical spectrum — from infrared, through the visible, to ultraviolet light. Hubble is equipped with cameras, spectrographs and fine guidance sensors. The observatory was designed to be serviced in space, allowing outdated instruments to be replaced. The telescope was placed into a low-Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle and uses modular components so that it can be recovered on subsequent Shuttle Servicing missions and faulty or outdated parts more easily replaced before being re-released into orbit.  Power: Power for the computers and scientific instruments onboard is provided by two 2.45 x 7.56 m solar panels . The power generated by the panels is also used to charge six nickel-hydrogen batteries that provide power to the spacecraft for about 25 minutes per orbit while Hubble flies through the Earth's shadow.  Manoeuvring: The telescope uses an elaborate system of direction controls to improve its stability during observations. A set of reaction wheels manoeuvres the telescope into place and its position in space is monitored by gyroscopes .

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

But on the other hand, it’s quite a chore to make a Cassata alla Siciliana and although Fabrizia Lanza sailed through it without breaking a sweat, between using the right pan, mixing up your own almond paste, finding ricotta as good as the ricotta in Sicily, and getting the candied fruit (including the squash, which is the translucent white brick on the platter), it might be classified as one of those things that’s better left to the Sicilians.  (Nevertheless, if you want to give it a go, Saveur printed her Cassata recipe, and it’s also in her book, Coming Home to Sicily . I linked to additional recipes at the end of the post.)  According to Italian food specialist Clifford A. Wright , the word Cassata is derived from the Arabic word quas’at, or qas’at, which refers to a wide bowl. There is actually a special pan to make the cake; it’s a mold with sloped sides and a groove around the bottom so that when Cassata mold is lined with strips of almond paste, and overturned, there’s a rim to create a neat guard against the icing from running down the sides.  I found out what the pan was for when I was making some pine nut praline for an ice cream I was going to churn up for her, made by caramelizing 1 part sugar then stirring in 1 part lightly toasted pine nuts, which get spread on a flat, greased surface, and left to cool. In my haste to find a flat pan in an unfamiliar kitchen, I grabbed one Fabrizia’s nice Cassata pans, as I was eyeing its flat, wide surface, perfect for spreading the praline.  I wasn’t able to find where, globally, you can get one online . But I did find some dynamite metal popsicle molds during my search.  Speaking of kitchen tools, I was wowed by this amazing, single-purpose Italian tool. When I asked Fabrizia where she got it, she replied, “In America.”  So somehow, people in the U.S. are able to roll the almond paste to fit snugly into the pan, but not actually find the right pan.  The first thing Fabrizia did was to make her own almond paste using finely ground almonds. Because I am a crunchy-granola California type, I asked if you could make the cake without the green food coloring.  Fabrizia laughed, but being Sicilian, she explained that Cassata is a cake for fun, festive occasions, and the vibrant green is part of the riot of colors that make the cake what it is meant to be. Although, perhaps bowing to overseas sensibilities, her mother, Anna Tasca Lanza said in one of her books that if you leave the green coloring out, you should pour the icing over the entire cake so that it hides the almond paste.  After cutting spongecake into strips to make a top layer for the cake, she whipped up a seriously good ricotta cream with the fresh sheeps’ milk ricotta we’d watched being made just the day before. Since she had a little extra, she tossed the bowl toward me with a spoon, and I dug right in.  Ladies and gentlemen, or signore e signori, no matter how far you are, if you are not booking a ticket to Sicily to taste sweetened sheeps’ milk ricotta cream, may the rest of your life be filled with neutral-colored almond paste. (ie: No fun at all.)  Because she knows that I love bergamots as much as she does, she doused the spongecake with homemade bergamot syrup, which gave me the idea to return in the winter, when the bergamot and citron trees are bearing fruit, and do some serious candying and syrup-making with her.

Sincerely hoping that the wound is not serious, I send you my most earnest wishes for your speedy recover. The infamous attempt has caused much indignation here.

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts.  The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region.  The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. While some of the northern outposts of Aragon are inaccessible in winter because of snow, the region is, on the whole, fairly dry, enjoying a humid, Mediterranean-style climate in many areas.  Like most of Spain, Aragon was under the domination of the Moors from the 8th to the 14th centuries. However, many Muslims decided to remain in Aragon after the Christian Re-conquest, resulting in a style of architecture that is unique to Aragon.  Mudejar – meaning “those who are allowed to stay” – is a form of architecture employing bricks, plaster and the repetitive geometric patterns characteristic of early Islamic art. The buildings are finished off with ceramic tiles. The city of Teruel and the town of Calatayud are home to some of the best examples of Mudejar architecture.  Aragon may be best known for the marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla in 1469, which effectively created modern Spain. Their youngest daughter, Katherine of Aragon, became the first queen of Henry VIII of England.  Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in Spain, and funded Christopher Columbus’ expedition to America in 1492. For these accomplishments, they were dubbed “The Catholic Monarchs” by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. Everywhere in Aragon, there are reminders of the long, colorful history of Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign.  Abiding traditions  Aragon is steeped in tradition, and bull fighting and bull running play a major part in Aragonese culture. Most towns and villages hold some sort of bull festival in September; people who have issues with the ethics of bull fighting may be uncomfortable living in a region where the traditional is such an intrinsic part of local culture.  Aragon is also famous for the Jota, an energetic 17th-century dance particular to the region. While the flamenco, which originated in Andalucia, is now performed all over Spain, the Jota remains the proud possession of Aragonese culture. Both men and women perform the Jota, which involves a lot of noise and leaping around.  Moving to Aragon  Aragon has a population of around 1.3 million, of which over 10%, or about 173,000, are foreigners.  These come from all over the world, as there is significant foreign investment in the region. General Motors, Bosch Siemens and Adidas all have major plants in Aragon.  Property prices in Aragon are very competitive. On average, houses in Aragon are 56% cheaper than the national average.  Away from the regional capital of Zaragoza, which houses more than half of the region’s population, Aragon is sparsely populated. There are only two other cities– Teruel and Huesca – in all of Aragon. For those who want to get away from it all, Aragon is the place to do it.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

Monet in the \'90s: the Series Paintings  Average Customer Review: 4.7 out of 5 stars See all reviews (3 customer reviews)  This is an important and critically acclaimed book for all those wanting to study Monet and his series paintings.  Paul Hayes Tucker is the leading expert on Monet in the USA. This book locates the series paintings within the context of their time. Tucker looks at the development of his art before the 1890s and the cultural pressures of the 1880s that caused Monet to turn to serial painting.  He focuses on the major and minor series of paintings from the 1890s - including the paintings of Rouen Cathedral - and examines how they were painted and how they were received.  “To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor. What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me."  — Claude Monet  About Rouen Cathedral  Rouen Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral in Rouen, in northwestern France.  It\'s the seat of the Archbishop of Rouen and the building of Notre dame Cathedral started in 1200 and contains nearly the entire history of the Gothic style over a period of some 400 years. In the middle ages it\'s also where the kings of France were crowned.  Rouen is also situated some 60 kilometres from Giverny and is a city which Monet - and the French - knew well.  When looked at from the perspective of his paintings prior to 1892, the important thing to note is that he had never before before focused on one building or architectural element or even painted one motif as often as he did with Rouen Cathedral and its facades.  It\'s maybe important to note that Turner - the other great painter of atmosphere and light - had also created an engraving of Rouen Cathedral as part of his series on River Scenery in France.  The novelty of working with one motif meant that it became imbued with meaning. Hayes Tucker points to the religious revival in France in the 1890s and the fact that a Gothic Cathedral was a distinctly French symbol. Importantly Gothic was perceived in the 1890s as being symbolic  "Rouen Cathedral, West Facade, Sunlight" by Claude Monet | Source  Rouen and its Cathedral - background - articles on Wikipedia  map of Rouen Cathedral and the places where Monet painted  Monet\'s paintings of Rouen Cathedral - displayed as a series  Location and Dates  The Location  Monet\'s home area is Normandy.

There is little doubt that Stevenson would have liked solemnly to don the black cap and sentence them to the end he believed they richly deserved  -  dangling, necks broken, from a rope after a 9am walk to the gallows at Wandsworth or Pentonville.

The North American championship has no less than 11 flags to make use of during a racing weekend, each signaling something different to the usual IRL driver. As compared to its European counterpart Formula One, some of the flags used in the IRL - although having the same appearance - lead to different signals.  One example would be the flag signaling a driver in a slower car that he\'s about to be lapped by a fellow racer. Unlike most of the other racing series, the IRL driver is not forced, by the book, to slow down and let the other driver pass. That\'s probably why we see so many quarrels between IRL drivers (see Danica Patrick vs Milka Duno, Milka Duno vs Graham Rahal, etc), as not many are familiar with the term "fair-play racing".  But anyway, to get back on the subject, the drivers have to know exactly what each of the 11 flags represent in order to avoid further complications during a racing weekends. Some of the flags might lead to penalties or even disqualification (yellow, black, back and white cross), while others might signal some hazardous conditions ahead that, if not taken into account, might lead to a lost race.  But enough talk, let\'s have a look at what each of these flags are signaling inside the most important open-wheel racing series in the North American continent.  The green flag signals the start of the race, qualifying session, practice session or a re-start after the race was previously interrupted. What that means is that the car can begin racing at full speed and regardless of what happens in front/rear of the field.White Flag  It\'s the next best thing for an Indy Racing League leading driver, after the chequered flag. It basically means that the leader of the race has entered the last lap and has to hold on to the lead for a few more hundreds of meters. The white flag is usually waved from the starter\'s point on oval tracks. If a white flag is waved by a race official on a road course, it means the cars will have to slow down because there\'s an official car on the circuit.Yellow Flag  Like in many other racing series, the yellow flag signals some hazardous conditions ahead of the driver who sees it. That means he is required to slow down immediately and be prepared to drive behind the safety car. Also, no overtaking is allowed during the period of time the yellow flag is waved by the race marshals.  When the IRL visits an oval track – meaning most of the times – the yellow flag is joined by yellow lights.  As mentioned before, overtaking is strictly prohibited, unless we\'re talking about wrecked cars. That doesn\'t always apply to the pit road. Once the yellow flag is waved, most of the competitors will hit the pits for refuel and tire change. When trying to reach their team\'s pit stand or when leaving for the track, they are allowed to pass one another. Once they\'ve rejoined the field, overtaking becomes unacceptable.  When the marshals signal a furled yellow flag, it means the caution period is about to end in the upcoming lap.  Red Flag  Here\'s another flag that has the same meaning in almost every racing series worldwide. In the IRL, the red flag means the race or practice/qualifying session is immediately stopped due to unsafe conditions. The circuit officials will decide whether the ongoing conditions are compliant with the IRL safety standards and will redirect all cars to the pit lane.  The red flag could mean a temporary suspension of the race – due to a sever accident or a multi-car crash – or the race being completely over.Yellow and Red Striped Flag  Although overtaking is not prohibited under this flag, it | Question: In US motor racing, what colour flag would the driver see for \'one lap to go\'?', ['white'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7426'), ('Context: Tara Strong  Tara Strong (born Tara Lyn Charendoff; February 12, 1973) is a Canadian–American actress who has done voice work for numerous animations and video games and performed in various live-action productions.

Tracey was heartbroken and told Sharon that the house would be empty without Darryl and Garth would be crushed. Sharon offered to stay with her to help and support her.

Luncheon of the Boating Party is one of Renoir´s final works depicting a sociable scene from his early life.  Luncheon of the Boating Party shows a group of Renoir´s friends relaxing and enjoying food, drinks and good conversation on a balcony at the Maison Fournaise in Chatou, France. Renoir often included close friends is his paintings and in this canvas he also includes his future wife, Aline Charigot, who can be seen in the left foreground playing with a small dog.  It seems that Renoir portrays his feelings for Aline by separating her from the others and she is the only cast member who does not engage in conversation or flirting but instead directs all of her attention at her dog. Renoir also reinforces Aline´s status in the painting by using brighter colors for some items of clothing.  In terms of other attendees, in the right foreground of the paintings wearing a straw hat is Gustave Caillebotte, one of Renoir\'s wealthier customers. Other participants include the artist Paul Lhote, the amateur art historian, collector, and editor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts Charles Ephrussi, French poet Jules Laforgue, actresses Ellen Andree, Jeanne Samary and Angele Legault, former mayor of colonial Saigon Baron Raoul Barbier, the proprietor´s children Louise-Alphonsine Fournaise and Alphonse Fournaise Jr. , bureaucrat Eugene Pierre Lestringez, and Italian journalist Maggiolo.  Luncheon of the Boating Party is among Renoir´s most famous canvases and it is a true representation both this period of time and Impressionism.  Luncheon of the Boating Party Inspirations for the Work  Edgar Degas  Antoine Watteau  It was in 1868 that Renoir first discovered Chatou and he instantly fell in love with it. After discovering the Restaurant Fournaise, Renoir became a regular guest. During his career, the artist painted no less than thirty canvasses in Chatou - many in the restaurant itself and other of the proprietor\'s family and the surrounding areas.  Luncheon of the Boating Party was intended to replicate everyday modern life and Renoir was eager to display his work at the official Salon Des Arts. However, the famous collector Paul Durand-Ruel purchased the canvas for the 7th Impressionist Exhibition instead, despite Renoir\'s wishes.  Many art historians suggest that Luncheon of the Boating Party was a response to a challenge printed in the June review of the official Salon exhibition of 1880 by famous writer and critic Emile Zola. Zola condemned the Impressionists saying: "they show their works while incomplete, illogical, exaggerated... " Zola dared the Impressionists to produce more completed and complicated modern-day paintings and so it could be the case that Renoir\'s ambitious project with Luncheon of the Boating Party, its lengthy execution and detailed arrangement are a response to Zola\'s challenge.  Others believe that Renoir created this painting as a direct response to the disbanding of the \'brotherhood\' of French Impressionist artists such as Renoir, Monet, Caillebotte, Pissaro, Sisley, Cezanne and Marisot. It was around this time that Degas declared that these artists could not contribute work to both the official Salon and the separate Impressionist show which resulted in Renoir, Monet, Sisley and Cezanne being excluded.  As well as this, Degas was introducing new, younger artists to the Impressionist movement and so it could be that Renoir was keen to reinforce his status as one of the movement\'s greatest painters and therefore set about working on this canvas.  There are many other possible inspirations for Luncheon of the Boating Party given the fact that Renoir was so passionate about his work and drew inspiration from a variety of sources. The artists\' admiration for the history of art and the works exhibited in the Louvre in Paris continued to motivate him throughout his career.  It\'s likely that for Luncheon of the Boating Party Renoir was influenced by Paolo Veronese\'s grand banquet scene, The Marriage Feast at Cana | Question: Who painted Luncheon of the Boating Party?', ['renoir', 'auguste renoir'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1423'), ('Context: Diego Tonetto  Diego Rubén Tonetto (born 5 December 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for Instituto Atlético Central Córdoba as a left winger.

Discovered by space telescopes at some point between 2050 and 2077, Pandora has been the single most interesting thing to happen to the human race in hundreds of years. The news services love to run clips of the wild scenery on Pandora and its bizarre flora and fauna .  To the cultures of Earth , Pandora is mysterious, primal and terrifying. Even from orbit, the scope of florae present on the surface indicates a moon brimming with life. One of the creatures on Pandora is the direhorse , a gray-skinned, hexapodal horse-like animal with bioluminescent qualities that the Na\'vi ride when hunting. The Na\'vi also ride the mountain banshee to hunt from the air, but the hunter can become prey in the presence of the great leonopteryx . In the canopy below, other deadly yet exotic animals roam: vicious packs of viperwolves , thick skinned hammerhead titanotheres and the most fearsome creature of all, the thanator . Other than the richness of varying colors, the trees resemble those of Earth. They have the familiar trunks, branches and leaves, though due to the difference in gravity, many of the shapes appear strange to humans and the proportions are greater because of the lower gravity. The trees and plant life of Pandora have formed electrochemical connections between their roots and effectively act as neurons, creating a moon-wide "brain" that has achieved sentience, which is known to the Na\'vi as Eywa .  Pandora, despite being almost as large as Earth, is only a moon of the gas giant Polyphemus, which has thirteen other moons. However, due to the smaller size, its gravity is 20% less than Earth\'s. Due to Pandora\'s lower gravity, most creatures on Pandora are hexapods (six-legged), although the Na\'vi resemble humans and have only two legs. Creatures roam the air and forest canopy below, similar to Earth\'s animals, but on a scale several times larger. Pandora\'s wildlife also have bioluminescent qualities. Depending on the position of the various moons, Pandora can have two or even three moons in its sky at once. Pandora and the other moons cast large black shadows on Polyphemus.  Pandora looks like a lush paradise by Earth standards during the day, but at night, virtually all life on the moon exhibits bioluminescent qualities in various shades of blue, purple and green. This possibly explains the Na\'vi\'s blue skin color, which most likely provides them better camouflage at night on Pandora.  Contents  Edit  Pandora\'s atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (>18%), xenon (>5.5%), methane, and hydrogen sulfide (>1%) and is about 20% denser than the atmosphere on Earth primarily due to the high percentage of Xenon; a heavy, colourless, odourless, and generally unren active noble gas. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the Pandoran atmosphere makes it extremely poisonous to humans, rendering them unconscious in about 20 seconds and causing death in about 4 minutes when they venture out unprotected by specialized breathing masks. The hydrogen sulfide present is also quite poisonous; concentrations over 1000 ppm (0.1\xa0%) can cause immediate collapse with subsequent loss of breathing, even after inhalation of a single breath.  The increased air resistance within this denser atmosphere has a number of effects:  Lower terminal velocity. Combined with Pandora\'s twenty-percent lower gravity, a freely falling object\'s maximum speed is significantly less than on earth. A Na\'vi who happens to fall from a flying mountain banshee has a good chance of surviving uninjured if they are over a forested area. Even over water, falling spread-eagled can reduce their speed sufficiently to allow an impact with the surface that will not knock them unconscious.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

The location(s) of the Adrenal Glands:  The human body normally* includes two adrenal glands.  They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen.

Suggs Biography (Wikipedia)  Graham McPherson (born 13 January 1961), better known as Suggs, is an English singer-songwriter, musician, radio personality and actor.  In a career spanning more than 30 years, Suggs came to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead singer of the English ska band Madness, which released fifteen singles that entered the Top 10 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1970s, 1980s and the 1990s, including "My Girl", "Baggy Trousers", "Embarrassment", "It Must Be Love", "House of Fun", "Driving in My Car", "Our House", "Wings of a Dove" and "Lovestruck". Suggs began his solo career in 1995, while still a member of Madness. Since then, he has released two studio albums, and two compilation albums. His solo hits include "I\'m Only Sleeping", "Camden Town", "Cecilia" and "Blue Day".  Suggs has also been an actor, with roles in films, theatre and television. He has married once and is the father of two children.  This entry is from Wikipedia , the user-contributed encyclopedia.

"Thirty bloody years I\'ve been wiv \'em." For a moment I think he\'s talking about his band, those baggy-trousered nutty boys; turns out he means his bank. They kept him waiting an hour and a half, despite three decades as a loyal customer – "and despite us shooting some of our best videos there as well".  But that\'s not the whole story of his tardiness for our rendezvous at Quo Vadis, his Soho club. En route from his home in Camden he bumped into Graham Coxon from Blur and an earnest discussion about the perils of the rock reunion soon necessitated strong drink. And there was another impediment for Suggs – an injured hand.  "Last night I was on the Mall with Buckingham Palace up ahead and Admiralty Arch – where John Prescott bonked his secretary – behind me and I just thought: \'London, my London – what tales lie therein.\' So when I saw this big pile of leaves I was so exhilarated that I just dived in. And that\'s how I hurt my hand."  Days can sometimes blend into nights for Suggs. I deduce this from the following greeting to Quo Vadis\'s manager: "Oi, Eduardo! You\'re still wearing last night\'s shirt with last night\'s stain – you dirty slag!" And once a day/night at least, he probably begins a sentence thus: "London, my London..."  London has always featured in Madness songs and they\'ve marked their 30th anniversary with The Liberty Of Norton Folgate, something of a London concept album, earning the band – Edinburgh\'s star attraction for the world\'s biggest Hogmanay street party – the best reviews of their career.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect\'s talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators\' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, "My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.

Two to four players play in any game of Scrabble. The object of     Scrabble is to score more points than one\'s opponent. A player     collects points by placing words on the game board. Each letter has     a different point value, so the strategy becomes to play words with     high scoring letter combinations.  The Scrabble Board  A Scrabble game board is made of up cells in a square grid. The     Scrabble board is 15 cells wide by 15 cells high. The Scrabble tiles     fit within these cells one to a cell.  Scrabble Tiles  Scrabble     is played with exactly 100 tiles. 98 of these tiles contain letters     on them, while there are 2 blank tiles. These blank tiles add a     wildcard aspect to Scrabble. The blanks substitute for any letter in     the alphabet. Once played, a blank tile remains for the remainder of     the game the letter for which it was substituted when first played.  Various letters have different point values, depending on the     rarity of the letter and the difficulty in playing it. Blank tiles     have no point value.  Tile Values  Here are the point values for each letter in Scrabble.  0 Points - Blank tile.  1 Point - A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U.  2 Points - D and G.  3 Points - B, C, M and P.  4 Points - F, H, V, W and Y.  5 Points - K.  8 Points - J and X.  10 Points - Q and Z.  Extra Point Values  Some squares on the Scrabble board represent multipliers. If a     tile is placed on this square, then the tile\'s value is multiplied     by a factor or either 2x or 3x. Certain tiles multiply the point     value of an entire word and not simply the tile on that space.  Double Letter Scores - Light blue cells are found isolated     on the board. When a tile is placed on this space, that tile\'s point     value is multiplied by two.  Triple Letter Score - This is a dark blue cell on the     Scrabble. The tile placed on this square has its points multiplied     by three.  Double Word Score - Light red cells are found running     diagonally towards the four corners of the board. When a player     plays a word on one of these squares, the point value of the entire     word is multiplied by two.  Triple Word Score - This is a dark red square on the     Scrabble board. These are found on the four sides of the board     equidistant from the four corners of the board. When a word is     played using this square, then the points for the word are     multiplied by three.  One Single Use - Note that extra point squares are only     usable once. If one player plays a word using this cells, then the     next time that space is used to make a word, the point value is not     multiplied.  Starting the Game  Without looking into the tile bag, each of the Scrabble players     takes one tile out of the tile bag. Whichever player has the letter     closest to the beginning of the alphabet goes first. A blank tile is     considered better than an "A". These tiles are placed into the bag     once more.  Starting the game, each player begins their turn by drawing seven     tiles apiece from the bag. The player can do one of three things on     a turn. The player can place a word, exchange tiles or pass. Most of     the time, the player will take the option of playing a word.  Exchanging tiles allows a player to replace anywhere between one     and all of the tiles on the player\'s rack. If this option is taken,     the player cannot do anything else that hand. | Question: How many squares are found along one side of a Scrabble board?', ['15'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4314'), ('Context: Where is Coney Island, NY? / Where is Coney Island, NY ...Where is Coney Island, NY? / Where is Coney Island, NY Located in The World? / Coney Island Map - WorldAtlas.com  Where is Coney Island, NY?

It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.

The first blood transfusions were also attempted around this time, although these were often unsuccessful and proved fatal in humans.  The first successful blood transfusion recorded was performed by British physician Richard Lower in 1665 when he bled a dog almost to death and then revived the animal by transfusing blood from another dog via a tied artery.  In 1667, Jean-Baptiste Denis who was physician to King Louis XIV, performed the transfusion of blood from an animal to a human. Denis transfused the blood from a sheep to a 15-year old boy and later to a labourer, both of whom survived the transfusions.  Related Stories  Zika virus infection can break down and damage testes of male mice, new research shows  In 1818, British obstetrician James Blundell successfully transfused human blood to a patient who had hemorrhaged during childbirth. In 1901, Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian physician discovered the first human blood groups, which helped transfusion to become a safer practice. By performing experiments in which he mixed blood samples taken from his staff, Landsteiner discovered blood groups A, B and O and established the basic principals of ABO compatibility. In 1907, an American surgeon called Reuben Ottenberg suggested that patient and donor blood should be grouped and cross matched before a blood transfusion procedure.  Between 1914 and 1918, anticoagulants such as sodium citrate were found to prolong the shelf life of blood and refrigeration also proved to be an effective means of preserving blood. In the 1920’s and 30’s, the voluntary donation of blood for storage and use was started. At around the same time, Edwin Cohn developed cold ethanol fractionation, a method of breaking down blood into its component parts to obtain albumin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen, for example.  During the Second World War, blood transfusion was used on a large scale to treat injured soldiers and became well known as a life saving procedure.  “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human ...Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″ | BRANCH  Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″  Abstract  The first experiments in blood transfusion took place in the seventeenth century, using blood drawn from animals. After the death of a French patient and the trial of his physician for manslaughter, transfusion was abandoned for a century and a half. When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth. During the course of the century, transfusion was applied as a remedy to different kinds of sicknesses and injuries, and performed at different times with various fluids. By the 1880s, British doctors had abandoned transfusion with blood in favor of infusion with saline solution; the practice was only again resumed after the recognition of human blood types in the twentieth century. Developments in the practice of transfusion and infusion during the century reflect shifting views of how gender and species identity are embodied, and of relations of affinity and immunity between bodies of different kinds. They also reflect a shift from a vitalist to a mechanist understanding of blood and its function.  Download this page in PDF format  Blood transfusion as a medical practice dates to the seventeenth century; [1] > the first experiments were performed a few decades after William Harvey published his demonstration that blood circulates in the body in De Motu Cordis (1628).\xa0 Harvey’s discovery showed that blood circulated indefinitely, rather than being either consumed within the body or expelled from it. To cure pathologies of the blood was thus no longer exclusively a matter of stimulating or preventing its evacuation; now the goal was to affect blood’s circulation within the body and its interaction with other organs. The earliest blood transfusions involving human subjects were carried out almost simultaneously in France and England in 1667.

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. | Question: Who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', ['fox talbot', 'henry fox talbot'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6913'), ('Context: JapanJapan ( Nippon or Nihon; formally  \' or Nihon-koku, "State of Japan") is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, China, Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The kanji that make up Japan\'s name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun".  Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan\'s land area. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions. The population of 126\xa0million is the world\'s tenth largest. Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan\'s total population. Approximately 9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo,  the capital city of Japan, which is the sixth largest city proper in the OECD and the fourth leading global city in the world.  The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world\'s largest metropolitan area with over 35 million residents and the world\'s largest urban agglomeration economy.  Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan\'s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.  Japan is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power.    The country has the world\'s third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world\'s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world\'s fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world\'s eighth largest military budget,  used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population enjoys the highest life expectancy, the third lowest infant mortality in the world,    and ranked first in the number of Nobel laureates of any country in Asia.

Kamprad displayed entrepreneurial skills as a boy when he began selling matches to neighbours. In 1943, at age 17, he founded a company called IKEA, the name of which was based on his own initials and on the first letters of the farm (Elmtaryd) and the village (Agunnaryd) where he grew up. He initially sold such items as picture frames, jewelry, and nylon stockings over the telephone; as the business grew, he started distributing catalogs. In 1948 Kamprad began selling inexpensive furniture, and the new merchandise proved to be so popular that in 1951 IKEA began to offer only home furnishings. Two years later he opened a showroom in Almhult, Sweden. IKEA’s low prices angered competitors, and they pressured Swedish suppliers to boycott the company. Kamprad responded by having IKEA design its own merchandise and by contracting with foreign businesses for materials.  In 1956 Kamprad introduced to IKEA’s inventory flat-boxed furniture that was designed to be assembled at home. This proved to be the company’s breakthrough. The new items decreased shipping and labour costs dramatically and allowed customers to easily transport the merchandise home. The compact size of the packaged merchandise also meant that items could be stocked at the sales location instead of in a warehouse, and in 1958 the first IKEA retail outlet opened. IKEA stores followed, first in several countries in western Europe and later in other regions. Over the next 50 years, nearly 300 IKEA stores opened around the world. The distinctive stores—each one highlighted by a vibrant blue and yellow roof—typically had more than 80,000 items in stock and also featured children’s play areas and Swedish restaurants.  In 2000 IKEA began selling merchandise on the Internet, and the company expanded rapidly. By 2003 it was so popular that its catalog had the world’s largest annual print run, and by 2009 the catalog was being issued in more than two dozen languages. IKEA’s phenomenal success made Kamprad one of the richest men in the world in the early 21st century. He wrote (with Bertil Torekull) Historien om IKEA (1998; Leading by Design: The IKEA Story). The book included autobiographical information about Kamprad, notably his involvement with Nazi and fascist groups in the 1940s, for which he publicly apologized.

Photo: IKEA  Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA  Swede Ingvar Kamprad began with two empty hands to become one of the richest people in the world – as the founding\xa0owner of furniture chain store IKEA. Here’s his story, from farm life to flat-packs.  Rural childhood  Ingvar Feodor Kamprad was born on 30 March\xa01926, on a small farm called Elmtaryd near the village of Agunnaryd, in the Swedish province of Småland. To most present-day Swedes, the date and the names, in a famously rural region, resound of harsher times, when Sweden was agrarian and poor. They speak of hard work, frugality and egalitarianism rooted in shared poverty – values which would eventually enter the IKEA ethos.  Humble beginnings  Kamprad began his career at the age of six, selling matches. When just ten, he criss-crossed the neighbourhood on his bicycle, selling Christmas decorations, fish and pencils.  At 17, in 1943, Kamprad’s father rewarded him with a small sum of money for doing well in school, despite being dyslexic.

With these goals, the vanguard of Santa Anna\'s army arrived in San Antonio about 23 February 1836.  Some 145 Texans in the area took refuge in the fortified grounds of an old mission known as the Alamo, under the joint command of William B. Travis (for the regular army) and Jim Bowie (for the volunteers).  Over the following two weeks, the Mexican forces continually strengthened to over 2000 troops.  During the same period, a few reinforcements for the Texans answered Travis\' famous Appeal for Aid and managed to penetrate enemy lines and enter the Alamo grounds, bringing the total strength of the defenders to about 189 men.  After periodic bombardment, the siege ended on the morning of 6 March when the Mexicans storm the Alamo fortress.  During the battle, all of the Texan defenders were killed.  Several non-combatants were spared, including Susanna Dickenson, the wife of one of the defenders, Susanna\'s baby, and a servant of Travis.  Partly to reinforce his goal of terrorizing colonists in Texas, Santa Anna released this small party to inform Texans of the fate of the defenders.  Losses in the battle have been placed at 189 Texans against about 1600 for the Mexicans.  The Alamo - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.comThe Alamo - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com  Google  Early History of the Alamo  Spanish settlers built the Mission San Antonio de Valero, named for St. Anthony of Padua, on the banks of the San Antonio River around 1718. They also established the nearby military garrison of San Antonio de Béxar, which soon became the center of a settlement known as San Fernando de Béxar (later renamed San Antonio). The Mission San Antonio de Valero housed missionaries and their Native American converts for some 70 years until 1793, when Spanish authorities secularized the five missions located in San Antonio and distributed their lands among local residents.  Did You Know?  Ten years after Texas won its independence and shortly after it was annexed by the United States, U.S. soldiers revived the "Remember the Alamo!" battle cry while fighting against Mexican forces in the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.  Beginning in the early 1800s, Spanish military troops were stationed in the abandoned chapel of the former mission. Because it stood in a grove of cottonwood trees, the soldiers called their new fort “El Alamo” after the Spanish word for cottonwood and in honor of Alamo de Parras, their hometown in Mexico . Military troops–first Spanish, then rebel and later Mexican–occupied the Alamo during and after Mexico’s successful war for independence from Spain in the early 1820s. In the summer of 1821, Stephen Austin arrived in San Antonio along with some 300 U.S. families that the Spanish government had allowed to settle in Texas . The migration of U.S. citizens to Texas increased over the next decades, sparking a revolutionary movement that would erupt into armed conflict by the mid-1830s.  The Battle of the Alamo  In December 1835, in the early stages of Texas’ war for independence from Mexico, a group of Texan (or Texian) volunteers led by George Collinsworth and Benjamin Milam overwhelmed the Mexican garrison at the Alamo and captured the fort, seizing control of San Antonio. By mid-February 1836, Colonel James Bowie and Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis had taken command of Texan forces in San Antonio. Though Sam Houston , the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Texan forces, argued that San Antonio should be abandoned due to insufficient troop numbers, the Alamo’s defenders–led by Bowie and Travis–dug in nonetheless, prepared to defend the fort to the last.

Max Bygraves, host of the second incarnation.  Then sit back and watch the \'fun\' in the peak years of what was one of television\'s highest rated and longest running game shows, Family Fortunes.  Third host Les Dennis with Mr.Babbage  As Paul Merton said in Have I Got News for You - "they\'ll get asked to name something with a motor in it and they\'ll say something like... \'a cat\' " and it was so true!  100 people were polled on a innocuous question such as Name something you do in bed, and a person from each family hit a buzzer and guessed as to what the public might have said.  The buzz-off for control of the board  If it wasn\'t the top answer then the opposing team were allowed to guess. Whoever had the most popular answer got to take the question for their team (they could pass it if they wanted, but that was a rare occurrence). The rest of the family then took it in turns to guess answers until they got three incorrect guesses (as represented by a cross and a UH-UHHHHH! sound).  The game board  If the opposing team then guessed an answer not yet found they won the money (a pound for every person that replied to that answer). If not, any found money went to the first team.  After the break they played for Double Money. You\'re probably intelligent enough to guess what happened there.  The set as seen in 1999  The family who first made £300 went through to the final round where the excitement peaked (apparently) when the family with the most points selected two members of the family to play a fast money game against the clock- yes, it was time for Biiiig Money! (At least, Max Bygraves enjoyed whipping it up in that way, but the other hosts didn\'t tend to make such a big deal of it, except for reminding the contestants of the money - and possibly car or holiday - they could win).  A contestant plays the end game  It was a nice gentle show with a lot of humour in it, and there was some evolution of the format near the end - particularly the chance to win a car (and later a holiday) if you found all five top answers in the end game. But as the millennium approached we thought couldn\'t ITV be a bit braver and try something new for a change instead of cranking out yet another series? Come in number 5, your time is up.  Then, in 2002, the show moved to daytime. Les Dennis left, knowing that this was going to be the final nail in the coffin for the show, and the oh-so-famous Andy Collins became the new host.

It dates from the fifteenth century although has been rebuilt over the years, the latest due to a traffic accident! The village has an excellent choice of fine shops and services for everyday items and there is a good choice of hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation. Cheddar village is an excellent base for walks around Cheddar in the Mendip Hills and for visiting Cheddar Gorge and the Showcaves.  Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company  There is a range of events held in the town and The Village Diary publication available in the library and shops in the village has up-to-date listings. Just before Christmas there's the Cheddar Festive Shopping Night. A farmer's market and local businesses open late for gift buying and special events like firework displays, choir singing and candlelit tours of Cheddar Caves are take place.  Threading your way through the village you'll find Cheddar Caves and Gorge up Cliff Road to the north west of Cheddar Village. Here you'll find the concentration of tourist shops, and a whole host of pubs, fish and chip shops and cafes. This includes the only remaining Cheddar Cheese company making the cheese actually in Cheddar - The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company. The local Tourist Information Office is in Cheddar Gorge itself just down from Cheddar Caves.  Cheddar Cheese  According to local legend Cheddar Cheese was discovered accidentally when a milkmaid left a pail of milk in the nearby Cheddar Gorge caves. Later the milkmaid returned to find that the milk had turned into a new tasty substance and Cheddar cheese was born. Whether this is true or not we will never know, as Cheddar Cheese was only first recorded in 1170. The distinctive tangy taste is said to be due to the traditionally rich pastures grazed by the cows whose milk is used to produce the cheese. It was traditionally matured in the Cheddar caves and The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company has recently revived this tradition.  You will see and smell the aroma of their rounds of cheese wrapped in muslin cheesecloth if you visit Gough's Cave.  The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company is the only cheese-makers still producing Cheddar Cheese in Cheddar. You can visit the Shop and Dairy in Cheddar Gorge and take a guided tour to find out how Cheddar Cheese is made. They make a whole range of cheeses from traditional mature cheddar to flavoured cheddars with ingredients like chilli, garlic or chives.  Cheddar Show Caves - Cox's Cave Tour  Cheddar Reservoir Birdwatching, Sailing & Fishing  Just to the west of Cheddar village is Cheddar Reservoir. This was built in the 1930s to take advantage of the springs from Cheddar Gorge. Although it still supplies drinking water it is also used for recreation including sailing, wind-surfing and fishing. It is in a lovely location with the Mendip Hills behind the reservoir to the north. There are two car park one at the Axbridge end and one on the eastern side accessible from Cheddar.  You can walk around the reservoir which is a good waterside walk with excellent views of the Mendips. The reservoir is also a special wildlife site for its waterfowl, so it's also a good place for birdwatching. It is particularly important as a wintering site for gadwall, goldeneye, great crested grebe, mallard, teal, shoveler, Cheddar Reservoir also attracts one of the largest flocks of pochard in England and Wales. You can also see migrant waders and terns throughout the year.  Cheddar Reservoir was the first reservoir to allow sailing. The eastern part of the reservoir is leased by Bristol Corinthian Yacht Club. This is a members club but they do organise open events throughout the year. Angling is also popular at Cheddar Reservoir particularly fishing for pike and roach. The fishing is leased to Cheddar Angling Club who also fish at the clay pits below the below the reservoir.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] | Question: What is another term for rotors?", ['rotating discs'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3467'), ('Context: Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science.

She performed professionally in London before joining Les Ballets Russes in 1923.  After she left Les Ballets Russes in 1925, de Valois established a private dance studio in London and started a ballet company. The Vic-Wells Ballet changed names numerous times before becoming the Royal Ballet, one of the world\'s leading classical ballet companies. De Valois started a second ballet company in 1946 that is now located in Birmingham and called the Birmingham Royal Ballet.  In addition to her numerous administrative and teaching duties, de Valois choreographed several works, including The Rake\'s Progress (1935), The Prospect Before Us (1940) and a version of Don Quixote (1950). Her talent for launching national dance companies extended beyond Britain. She was instrumental in recommending Celia Franca for the position of founding artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada . In 1956, de Valois became the founding director of the Turkish State Ballet.  Although she officially retired from her position as artistic director of the Royal Ballet in 1963, de Valois remained on faculty at the Royal Ballet School for a number of years.

"It must be Madam," said those of us who could not see her, and everyone spontaneously rose to applaud the fragile, white-haired figure who had been wheeled to her place at the side of the stalls circle.  Madam it was. Dame Ninette de Valois, who has died aged 102, had made it, as she had made it almost every year, to see the student dancers who would carry forward the work she had started so many years ago - the tiny enterprise that was to grow into the whole edifice of the Royal Ballet and its school.  Earlier that year, on February 20, she had made it to Covent Garden for the 50th anniversary of the reopening of the Royal Opera House in 1946 with her company\'s production of The Sleeping Beauty. And she had come on stage for a standing ovation, led by the Queen from the royal box.  She was also at Sadler\'s Wells that year for the final gala there, before the demolition of the theatre where her company had started. Far from being sentimental or nostalgic, Dame Ninette, although she never ceased to recognise the vital part which that theatre, thanks to Lilian Baylis, had played in the foundation of British ballet, knew it was time for rebuilding and lent her blessing to the enterprise.

It is dynastically sort of a continuation to Cenél nGabráin of Dál Riata, "race of Fergus", as "house" an originally Celtic concept to express one of the two rivalling leader clans of early medieval Scotland, whose founding father is king Fergus Mor of Dalriada. This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cenél nGabráin were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld.  Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cenél Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc.  Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan\'s son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.  Domnall III, r. 1093-1094 and 1094-1097  Donnchad II, r. 1094  William I (William the Lion), r.1165-1214  Alexander II, r.1214-1249  House of StuartThe House of Stuart, originally Stewart and, in Gaelic, Stiubhard is a European royal house that originated in Scotland. The dynasty\'s patrilineal Breton ancestors had held the office of High Steward of Scotland since the 12th century, after arriving by way of Norman England. The royal Stewart line was founded by Robert II, and they were Kings and Queens of Scots from the late 14th century through the union with England in 1707.  Mary I, Queen of Scots was brought up in France, where she adopted the French spelling of the name, Stuart.  Her son, James VI of Scotland, inherited the thrones of England and Ireland upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603.  Except for the period of the Commonwealth, 1649-1660, the Stuarts were monarchs of England, Scotland and Ireland until 1707; then of Great Britain and Ireland, to the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. James VI of Scotland then inherited the realms of Elizabeth I of England, becoming James\xa0I of England and Ireland in the Union of the Crowns. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688, two Stuart queens ruled the isles: Mary II and Anne. Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife.  Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who would brought up a Roman Catholic and would precede his half-sisters; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters.  But neither had any children who survived to adulthood, so under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704, the crown passed to the House of Hanover on the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, to the midpoint of the Early modern period.

Suggs Biography (Wikipedia)  Graham McPherson (born 13 January 1961), better known as Suggs, is an English singer-songwriter, musician, radio personality and actor.  In a career spanning more than 30 years, Suggs came to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead singer of the English ska band Madness, which released fifteen singles that entered the Top 10 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1970s, 1980s and the 1990s, including "My Girl", "Baggy Trousers", "Embarrassment", "It Must Be Love", "House of Fun", "Driving in My Car", "Our House", "Wings of a Dove" and "Lovestruck". Suggs began his solo career in 1995, while still a member of Madness. Since then, he has released two studio albums, and two compilation albums. His solo hits include "I\'m Only Sleeping", "Camden Town", "Cecilia" and "Blue Day".  Suggs has also been an actor, with roles in films, theatre and television. He has married once and is the father of two children.  This entry is from Wikipedia , the user-contributed encyclopedia.

"Thirty bloody years I\'ve been wiv \'em." For a moment I think he\'s talking about his band, those baggy-trousered nutty boys; turns out he means his bank. They kept him waiting an hour and a half, despite three decades as a loyal customer – "and despite us shooting some of our best videos there as well".  But that\'s not the whole story of his tardiness for our rendezvous at Quo Vadis, his Soho club. En route from his home in Camden he bumped into Graham Coxon from Blur and an earnest discussion about the perils of the rock reunion soon necessitated strong drink. And there was another impediment for Suggs – an injured hand.  "Last night I was on the Mall with Buckingham Palace up ahead and Admiralty Arch – where John Prescott bonked his secretary – behind me and I just thought: \'London, my London – what tales lie therein.\' So when I saw this big pile of leaves I was so exhilarated that I just dived in. And that\'s how I hurt my hand."  Days can sometimes blend into nights for Suggs. I deduce this from the following greeting to Quo Vadis\'s manager: "Oi, Eduardo! You\'re still wearing last night\'s shirt with last night\'s stain – you dirty slag!" And once a day/night at least, he probably begins a sentence thus: "London, my London..."

They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have, according to the Sunday Mercury, sold more than 100 million records.  When MTV dawned in the early 1980s, it changed the face of popular music forever, and the British rock group Duran Duran was the first act to take full advantage of its possibilities. The five-member band of young, sculpted faces often adorned with make-up and expensive clothes, saw in the music video the perfect vehicle for propelling them beyond obscurity and their musical abilities to fame, fortune, and good times. Combining the sounds of 1970s British punk and the more upbeat, danceable rhythms of disco, Duran Duran began producing clean, sparkling (if not critically acclaimed), pop tunes. But what set them apart immediately were their videos: somewhat surreal escapist fantasies that took the self-styled playboys to such far-flung locales as Sri Lanka and Antigua. Screaming, record-buying, television-watching teen-age girls everywhere ate it up-and nobody could have predicted it better than the band members themselves. "Video to us is like stereo was to Pink Floyd," said Duran Duran keyboa rdist Nick Rhodes. "It was new, it was just happening. And we saw we could do a lot with it." But, with more than 25 years together and more than 70 million albums sold, the group has proven its significance well beyond the video screen.  While the conservative rock press liked to downplay the success of Duran Duran because of their obvious vanity and lack of attention to "serious" music, it should be noted that some of rock and roll\'s most time-honored heroes, such as Elvis Presley and even a few members of the Beatles, were never accused of being serious musicians. Success in pop music has always depended upon image at least as much as the music itself. And "serious music" is not necessarily for everyone as Rolling Stone\'s James Henke realized when he referred to Duran Duran\'s eager fans as "young girls who were glued to their television sets watching MTV every waking hour. These girls had little use for the Clash\'s left-wing politics, or the ranting and raving of that weird-looking Elvis Costello. But Duran Duran, now they were something else. Five extremely good-looking young men. Dream dates."  Duran Duran began coming together in 1978 (some sources say 1977) in the Midlands city of Birmingham, where Rhodes and guitarist John Taylor started performing with a variety of bandmates. The group, which takes its name from a character in the 1968 film Barbarella, became complete in 1980 when Simon Le Bon, a drop-out drama student, showed up one day in pink, leopard-skin leotards and said he wanted to sing in the band. Le Bon joined Rhodes, John Taylor (who switched to b ass), drummer Roger Taylor, and guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related), and the quintet began performing in Birmingham, most frequently at a club called Rum Runners which had become established as the home of England\'s burgeoning New Roma ntic scene. "Donning the foppish clothes of the movement and playing a slick, if superficial, brand of dance-pop, the band was tailor-made for the style obsessed New Romantics," said the Encyclopedia of Rock.  Duran Duran quickly became the headliners of that movement, playing at large clubs and festivals throughout England, and in early 1981 they released their first single, "Planet Earth," which went to number 12 on the United Kingdom charts.

Phlebotomists Duties: What Exactly does a Phlebotomist do?  written by: Victoria Trix•edited by: DaniellaNicole•updated: 1/31/2009  You may have heard the term Phlebotomist but what exactly are the duties of a Phlebotomist and what does a Phlebotomist do?  slide 1 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties  Phlebotomists duties and responsibilities center around the obtaining and proper handling of human blood. The basic services of the phlebotomist include taking blood samples from patients and correctly cataloging them for lab analysis, but the importance of the phlebotomist is far more critical than this simple description implies.  slide 2 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Critical Responsibilities  Since phlebotomists have an extremely high potential to be exposed to blood borne diseases and contaminants, the level of caution and expertise they use in the execution of their duties is critical to their own safety as well as all others that may be exposed to the fluid samples they draw. Under the direction of a physician or other licensed health care professional, phlebotomists duties includes collecting samples of blood and other fluids from patients. Prior to collection, it is the phlebotomist’s responsibility to assure that all collection instruments and environments are sterile and of first use.  After sample collection, the phlebotomists duties will include correctly labeling the collection container with pertinent patient information for identification, and subsequently must complete and file companion paperwork to trace the route of the sample from collection through lab work through final analysis and diagnosis and finally to proper disposal of the fluids. Any error in the job of a phlebotomist can have consequences that range from misdiagnosis to fatal contamination. In addition, phlebotomists on a hospital staff will also be required to train other phlebotomists in sample collection and follow up.  slide 3 of 5  Additional Phlebotomists Duties  Some phlebotomists duties, for example those that conduct home care visits, will also include being responsible for transportation of fluid samples between the sample site and the laboratory. In some cases the phlebotomists duties will also include being responsible for performing certain functions to process blood samples for further analysis by attending medical professionals.  Phlebotomists that work in a laboratory environment have the added task of ensuring that samples are correctly analyzed by enforcing quality control and safety measures to prevent the contamination of samples during analysis.  slide 4 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Education and Career  Phlebotomy training is obtained by passing a one year vocational program which is offered through technical schools or community colleges. Many community colleges also offer associate’s degree programs in phlebotomy. In addition to becoming certified as a phlebotomist, some states will require licensing or registration.  A certified phlebotomist can expect an annual salary ranging from $20,000 to $48,000, with an increase in demand for services expected through 2012. As the demand increases, more facilities will require pre-certification of phlebotomists before they are hired, to reduce the impact of liability.  Phlebotomists' duties and services are usually scheduled, rather than performed under emergency situations. Given this fact, phlebotomists usually have the benefit of shift hours that match regular office hours, which is a luxury not typically found in the medical profession.  slide 5 of 5 | Question: What does a phlebotomist usually deal with?", ['taking blood'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3552'), ('Context: Huguenot immigrants did not disperse or settle in different parts of the country, but rather, formed three societies or congregations; one in the city of New York, another 21 miles north of New York in a town which they named New Rochelle, and a third further upstate in New Paltz.

Fresh off of their independence war decades earlier, the US Navy found itself with nary a capable vessel of defending her merchant force and her interests from French aggression and pirate attacks. The resulting design initially encompassed some six ships of great gun strength but this was eventually curtailed to the USS United States, USS Constellation and the USS Constitution.  At her core, the USS Constitution was a traditional-looking three-masted great ship of oak wood hull construction and protected by copper sheathing throughout. She carried 32 x 24-pdr (pounder) long guns - supplemented by 20 x 32-pdr carronades and 2 x 24-pdr bow chasers making her a 44-gun heavy frigate. The crew complement was 450 personnel though today the vessel is supported by only 55 personnel in a primarily ceremonial role. She was partially launched on the 20th of September in 1797 where her weight prevented the official launching from completing. As a result, the reworked Constitution was once again ceremoniously launched on October 21st, 1797 in Boston Harbor.  The following year, the USS Constitution was actively patrolling the waters off of the southeast portion of the United States. During this time - the time of the Quasi-War with France, a conflict never formally declared and surprisingly fought entirely at sea - she saw action in support of marine units and was deserving of distinction in the conflict. By 1803, the vessel was serving in the Mediterranean Sea and fought along the North African coast to combat African nations seeking a sort of tax for American use of local Mediterranean trade ways. As the troubles in the Mediterranean subsided, a brewing conflict with the British was underway. The USS Constitution faced off with the HMS Guerriere in 1812 to which the Constitution earned her "Old Ironsides" nickname when British cannon rounds seemingly bounced off the American vessel\'s hull. After several more years of storied engagements and more years undergoing repairs for damaged received in those engagements, the Constitution was placed through major reconstruction which was completed by 1835 at the request of the United States Congress.  The Constitution was back in action in the American Civil War though she was not used in anger and merely moved to a safe location so as to protect her from Southern assault. The ironclad "New Ironsides" instead fought on in her name. With the close of the war and the arrivial of steam-powered vessels, wind-powered ships like the USS Constitution were less and less in need and would spend her days as a training ship for the Naval Academy at Annapolis. Following a world tour, the ship would be in dock once more for refitting and repair. She would later take part in her 200th celebration on July 21, 1997. The voyage of the Constitution would eventually find her in a home in Charleston Navy Yard.  Though a "show boat" in many regards, the USS Constitution is actually crewed by active sailors and commanders where it is regarded as an honor to serve on and underneath her decks for any chosen man. The vessel was first ordered in 1794, laid down that same year and launched in 1797. Acting US President George Washington is credited with naming the vessel after the United States Constitution. The Constitution completed a round-the-world voyage in March of 1844, taking some 30 months to accomplish the feat.

The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. | Question: Arundel Castle was damaged during a war between which two groups?', ['Parliamentarians ("Roundheads") and Royalists ("Cavaliers")'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-2959'), ('Context: Pomp and circumstances: Britten\'s Gloriana | Music | The ...Pomp and circumstances: Britten\'s Gloriana | Music | The Guardian  Classical music  Pomp and circumstances: Britten\'s Gloriana  Gloriana was written to celebrate the young Queen Elizabeth II\'s coronation but has barely been performed since.

Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone. This scene brings their difficult relationship to a close.

Lithuania Traveller Article:  Comments (5)  Changing money in Lithuania  Lithuania has its own currency which is the Lithuanian litas (LTL). Its symbol is simply "Lt", that is usually after the amount e.g. "3,82 Lt" . Each litas consists of 100 centas. Coins go as little as 1 centas to 5 litas, while banknotes (bills) go as from 10 litas to 500 litas.\xa0  The litas has been pegged to euro at the rate of 3.4528 LTL= 1 EUR \xa0since February 2002. Euro being the official peg currency makes commercial banks to follow Lithuanian Central Bank mandate (www.lb.lt) to not exceed 0.50 percent margin in commercial transactions. Lithuania has had hopes to join the EU monetary union in 2007 so the Euro would become the currency. SEB/Vilniaus Bankas (www.seb.lt) now claims no worries about converting to Euro and puts the best forecast for 2009. Thus among notable rates of exchange, it is roughly 4 litas to the pound sterling (2011). There is limited possibity to buy Litas outside of Lithuania so you have two main ways to get your spending money:  1. Take your own local currency and change it when you arrive. Go to a bank and you will find that the cashiers will exchange your money without the need for you to enter into any explanation. Just hand over the money and back will come the Lita. Some banks have a little machine inside the door with symbols on so that you just press the \'currency exchange\' button, receive a ticket with a number on and then wait for your turn.  2. The second way to obtain some spending money is take your bank card card to an cash machines (ATM) - be it Visa, Mastercard or any plain debit card bearring Cirrus logo. The machines will offer you a choice of languages when you insert your card. Select the appropriate one and then proceed as you would at home. The machines are common in the large cities in the sort of places that you would expect to find them - outside banks and supermarkets.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.

Timothy Brown , television series  Oliver Harmon "Spearchucker" Jones was a surgeon who appears in the MASH novel by Richard Hooker , the MASH movie and also in the M*A*S*H television series. He was portrayed by Fred Williamson in the movie and by Timothy Brown \xa0, who also\xa0played the part of corpsman Corporal Judson in the film.  In the television series Spearchucker appears in six episodes during the early part of Season 1 of the series and was one of the original Swampmen, along with Trapper, Hawkeye, and Frank Burns, but the character was dropped from the series after 6 appearances.  Contents  Edit  In the MASH novel, the Spearchucker character appears in Chapter 12. Here his full name is given as Oliver Wendell "Spearchucker" Jones. To deal with boredom, Hawkeye, Trapper and Duke Forrest discuss putting together a football team. Hawkeye suggests bringing Spearchucker into the team.  Hawkeye had roomed with Spearchucker at the 72nd Evac Hospital and had found out that besides being a neurosurgeon, Spearchucker had played football during medical school to earn some extra money and had been signed up by the Philadelphia Eagles. However very few people knew about this.  So they persuade Henry to request for a neurosurgeon, specifically Spearchucker, for the 4077th as a ringer for their football team. Spearchucker helps prepare the team and eventually plays a key role in strategizing their victory over the 72nd Evac hospital.  In the book, just like in the movie, Spearchucker reveals that the nickname "Spearchucker", ordinarily a racial slur, referred in this case to his javelin-throwing prowess.  Spearchucker in the MASH movie  Edit  In the MASH movie, Spearchucker\'s full name becomes Oliver Harmon Jones. The original screenplay lists his backstory much as it was given in the novel. However in the movie dialogue, this is covered much more briefly, and he is described as playing for the 49ers not the Eagles. His role in the football game is the same as described in the book.  The film also depicts Spearchucker as a particularly skilled neurosurgeon and this, together with the experience of playing football together, helps Duke Forrest overcome his racial prejudices and the two become friends at the end, shaking hands when it is time for Duke to go back stateside.

Perhaps there had been an intention to pursue the football theme in the M*A*S*H episodes but in the end not much is made of this. Spearchucker is only seen playing football once, with Radar, Boone and a few others at the beginning of the "Pilot" episode. He later attends the raffle party with Ginger (he\'s the one in the Samurai helmet).  In "Chief Surgeon Who" , we are reminded that he is a neurosurgeon when he tells Hawkeye in the O.R.: "outside of the brain I\'m dead". Hawkeye gives him advice on how to deal with a pancreatic injury which contradicts Franks, much to Frank\'s annoyance. Later, when General Barker is searching the camp for Henry, he stumbles into a tent when Spearchucker is playing strip dominoes with Ginger.

Presidents have entertained visiting heads of state, such a former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , conducted cabinet meetings, and briefed Congressional leaders at the retreat. The 1978 Middle East peace talks concluded with what have become known as the Camp David Accords. Yet few Americans know much about the place, considering its prominence.  Federal Summer Camp  It all started in 1935, when the Work Projects Administration , WPA, began building the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area Project near Thurmont, Maryland, as an example of creating parks from worn-out agricultural land.  Three years later, the area opened as a camp for federal government employees and their families. Known as Hi-Catoctin, the facility consisted of several small cabins, a dining hall, and a swimming pool. Covered with trees and 1,800 feet above sea level, the spot provided a cool respite from the near tropical humidity of the Washington, DC, area.  Meanwhile, immediately after America's entry into World War II, doctors for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt were urging the ailing president to find a place convenient to Washington, yet far enough away to escape the heat and political pressures of the city.  The presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was out of the question because of heightened security considerations imposed by the war. After a search committee considered two other sites on Furnace Mountain on the Virginia side of the Potomac River below Harper's Ferry; and Shenandoah National Park, Virginia; Roosevelt toured two sites in the Catoctin Mountains.  He picked Hi-Catoctin, issuing a set of instructions on how the buildings should be remodeled and asking for the construction of a main lodge, which resembled the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. The initial work cost $25,000. The camp was renamed the USS Shangri La, to follow up on the nautical connection, since many workers involved with the Potomac worked on the camp.  Popular Presidential Choice  Since Roosevelt inaugurated Shangri-La with a three-day visit beginning July 18, 1942, all subsequent presidents have made extensive use of the mountain top retreat.  President Harry Truman did not visit Shangri-La often because Bess, his wife, felt it was dull. However, when they did visit, the Trumans enjoyed Shangri-La. Truman's favorite sport was walking and he spent long hours wandering the mountain trails with a secret service agent in tow.  Renamed Camp David  President Dwight Eisenhower changed the name of the retreat to Camp David in honor of his grandson, David Eisenhower. Although he and his wife, Mamie, tended to use Camp David for private relaxation, Eisenhower held the first cabinet meeting ever to take place there. He also hosted British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David.  President John Kennedy and his family visited the camp often, enjoying the horseback riding and other recreational opportunities. Kennedy also allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use Camp David when he was not there.  President Lyndon Johnson held several important discussions with advisers on the Vietnam War, the crisis in the Dominican Republic, and other world events, at Camp David and hosted Prime Minister and Mrs. Harold Holt of Australia.  Reconstruction and Improvements  President Richard Nixon used Camp David as much as his five predecessors combined. Nixon had several new buildings built in compatible architectural styles, but complete with modern conveniences. He held cabinet meetings, staff conferences, hosted foreign dignitaries, and family get togethers at Camp David.  President Gerald Ford rode around Camp David on a snowmobile, and hosted President and Mrs. Suharto of Indonesia.  President Jimmy Carter hosted the now famous Camp David Summit in 1978, between Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and resulted in what are now known as the Camp David Accords establishing peace between Egypt and Israel.

Following the first abolition of the Greek monarchy, Philip was forced into exile with his poverty-stricken parents; he was famously carried in a makeshift cot made from an orange box.  Most of Philip\'s early life was spent moving from home to home. In adulthood, he became an officer in the Royal Navy, when he married the then-Princess Elizabeth, in 1947.\xa0Although he was born a prince of Greece and Denmark, he renounced those titles when he became a British citizen in 1947, and adopted the surname Mountbatten, an Anglicized version of Battenberg which came from his mother\'s side of the family.  On that occasion he was also created Duke of Edinburgh by his new father-in-law, King George VI. In 1957, he was given the title Prince Philip.\xa0His full title is now HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich.  Unlike Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, Philip was not given the title of Prince Consort. His children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, all share a surname of Mountbatten-Windsor, given to the children in honour of their father, by Queen Elizabeth, by an Order-in-Council in 1960. However, the Royal House name remains Windsor.  As consort to the Queen, Philip\'s responsibilities include supporting his queen in her duties as sovereign, and he is normally seen accompanying her to ceremonies including the State Opening of Parliament and overseas state visits. Philip is not only the longest-serving consort, but also the oldest serving spouse of a reigning monarch. He holds a number of royal titles, including Prince of the United Kingdom, which was bestowed upon him by the Queen in 1957.  Like other members of the royal family, Philip is linked to a number of charitable ventures through his patronage. He is either patron or president of 800 organisations covering a wide range of areas, including science, technological research and development, sport, welfare of young people and conservation and the environment. Over the course of his public life, Prince Philip has visited research stations and laboratories across the UK, as well as coalmines, factories, engineering works and industrial plants.  He was the first president of World Wildlife Fund - UK from its formation in 1961 to 1982, and international president of the organisation, which later changed to the World Wide Fund for Nature, from 1981 to 1996. His links with the body continue to date in his capacity as president emeritus. The Duke of Edinburgh is also associated with the UK higher education sector, having served as chancellor of the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Salford and Wales in the past. He is a life governor of King\'s College, London and patron of London Guildhall University.  Being an airman, Prince Philip boasts nearly 6,000 flying hours as a pilot through experience accumulated from 1952 to 1997. He is also patron of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators of the British Empire and has been Master of Trinity House since 1969.  His successful career, role beside the Queen and commendable public engagements notwithstanding, Prince Philip is also famous for his knack for providing unsavoury gaffes. He is particularly known in Britain for regularly causing offence with bigoted comments whilst on public visits. For example, when visiting China in 1986, he told a group of British students that they had better not stay there too long or they would get "slitty-eyed".

I was going on memory. I looked it up, and I can only find it as a Germanic root, but it may go back to PIE as well. This is from Wikipedia:  "The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner," and as such is related to the names of several other European regions where Germanic peoples came into contact with indigenous non-Germanic cultures, including: Wallonia (Belgium), Valais (Switzerland), and Wallachia (Romania), as well as the "-wall" of Cornwall and even the "wal-" in the walnut tree. However, it has also been suggested that the prefix "Wall" acknowledges a people who had contact with the Roman empire (see Vlach)."  Damian in Edinburgh \xa0 Tue Nov 06, 2007 9:18 am GMT  ***"The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner,"***  Ironically is indeed the operative word here.   As far as the English, particularly, are concerned, the Welsh people have always been considered more "foreign" than have the other constituent member races of the entire British Isles, including what is now the people of the Republic of Ireland, who, technically, are really foreigners.   Certainly we Scots have not been seen in quite the same light by the English as have the Welsh people as an entity.  I think that several factors are involved in this English perception of the Welsh as being "more foreign" - one being, of course, the survival of the Welsh Language, a Language seen as quite alien to English itself in so many ways.    There are characteristics of Welsh that are more similar to some Continental Languages than there are to English.   Bearing in mind the nature of the Welsh Language, you then have to consider the physical closeness of Wales to the main body of England geographically - ie the Midlands and Southern England generally, the areas most seen as the political powerhouse of England politically and culturally.  Here in Scotland we are considerably further away in distance from much of England (including London and the Home Counties) yet we are not seen as being as "foreign" as the Welsh as we do not have the "advantage" of a separate Language like they have.  Many English people feel a real sense of "difference" when crossing the border out of England and into Wales which they don\'t quite feel when driving out of England into Scotland.   I think that is entirely due to the sudden change from Anglo Saxon place names in England to the "foreign" looking Welsh place names in Wales - not to mention the fact that all road signs immediately become bi-lingual, including road markings ie "Araf" "meaning "Slow" painted on the road surfaces.  Each time I\'ve driven over the English/Welsh border (four times now) I noticed that at first the English word took precedence above the Welsh word, but the further into Wales you go - ie further into the strongholds of the still surviving (and flourishing) Welsh Language the Welsh word takes precedence.  This simply doesn\'t happen when travelling back and forth over the Scottish / English border which I have done countless numbers of times - if I had a quid for each time I\'ve crossed the border I\'d have a bloody good holiday on one of the Greek islands....or take a cruise down the Nile..I\'d love to go and take a peek at the newly resurrected King Tut.

Semenya won gold in the women\'s 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final. Semenya also won silver medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics, both in the 800 metres.  Following her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. She was withdrawn from international competition until 6 July 2010 when the IAAF cleared her to return to competition.  In 2010, the British magazine New Statesman included Semenya in a list of "50 People That Matter 2010".   Early life and education  Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in South Africa near Polokwane (back then called Pietersburg), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, "deep in South Africa\'s northern Limpopo province." She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a tomboy as a child.   Semenya attended Nthema Secondary School and now attends the University of Pretoria as a sports science student.   She began running as training for soccer.   Career  2008  In July Semenya participated in the 2008 World Junior Championships, and won the gold in the 800 m at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a time of 2:04.23.   2009  In the African Junior Championships Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.    With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone. The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date. It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by Zelda Pretorius at 1:58.85, and Zola Budd at 2:00.90, respectively.   The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it was "obliged to investigate" after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m\xa0– "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use."  The IAAF also asked Semenya to undergo a gender test after the win. News that the IAAF requested the test broke three hours before the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions."   In August Semenya won gold in the 800 metres at the World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final, again setting the fastest time of the year.   Gender test  Following her victory at the world championships, questions were raised about her gender.    The IAAF\'s handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticized the organization for its response to the incident.  Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as racist, as well as an affront to Semenya\'s privacy and human rights.   The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted."  The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a "rare medical condition" giving her an unfair competitive advantage. The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.  In an interview with South African magazine YOU Semenya stated, "God made me the way I am and I accept myself." She also took part in a makeover with the magazine.   On 7 September 2009, Wilfred Daniels, Semenya\'s coach with Athletics South Africa (ASA), resigned because he felt that ASA "did not advise Ms. Semenya properly". He apologised for personally having failed to protect her.

Uploaded on Jun 7, 2010  Nebuchadnezzar was the mighty King of the Babylonian Empire between 604 and 562 BC. Numerous cuneiform tablets and ancient texts speak of his wondrous achievements and prideful character. "Look at this, Babylon the great! And I built it all by myself, a royal palace adequate to display my honor and glory." Nebuchadnezzar trusted in his immense wealth and powerful warriors -- He had no room for God in his kingdom.  However, late in his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a philosophical wake-up call. Overnight, he went from mighty king to wandering madman, as he was stricken with a psycho-mania, which caused him to act like an animal. He grew long hair and nails, roaming about the countryside grazing on grass.  Seven years into his malady, Nebuchadnezzar returned to his senses; immediately, he knew his lifelong mistake. A once Godless ruler was now a God-fearing man. In fact, his own philosophical journey was recorded in the ancient texts of the prophet Daniel, who was living as a captive in Babylon:  "I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked to heaven. I was given my mind back and I blessed the High God, thanking and glorifying God, who lives forever.  "At the same time that I was given back my mind, I was also given back my majesty and splendor, making my kingdom shine. All the leaders and important people came looking for me. I was reestablished as king in my kingdom and became greater than ever. And that\'s why I\'m singing -- I, Nebuchadnezzar -- singing and praising the King of Heaven:  "Everything he does is right, and he does it the right way. He knows how to turn a proud person into a humble man."  Nebuchadnezzar was a mighty king, ruling a vast kingdom. By the world\'s standards, he was the most powerful man of his day. However, through a season of humbling, Nebuchadnezzar came to recognize that God is a far mightier king, ruling a kingdom that is everlasting.

Category  Nebuchadnezzar - Indiana Jones Wiki - WikiaNebuchadnezzar | Indiana Jones Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Edit  The Babylonians worshipped\xa0 Marduk , the ruler of a dimension called the Aetherium . According to ancient passages discovered by Indiana Jones , Marduk inspired King Nebuchadnezzar through writing, urging him to build a " great engine "\xa0in order to physically contact Marduk \'s\xa0own, otherworldly realm. Following this, the scripture becomes unclear: "Having no understanding, the rabble hath thrown down his work." It is therefore uncertain whether the masses abandoned the machine in accord with Nebuchadnezzar\'s orders or against Nebuchadnezzar\'s orders; much of the controversy regards whether the phrase "his work" refers to the work of Nebuchadnezzar or Marduk. However, it is known that four "trusted" Disciples of Marduk , named\xa0 Urgon , Taklit , Nub , Azerim , each fled from Babylon with essential pieces of the Machine and created or summoned minions and one great Guardian to guard over these parts after they had died.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Since then, the plot of the novel has woven its way into popular culture: Captain Ahab and the hunt for the White Whale continue to spark adaptations, reworkings, and allusions, while the opening line, "Call me Ishmael," remains one of the most well-known first words in fiction. However, Ishmael both as narrator and character has been primarily the property of academic rather than popular culture. Particularly following F. O. Matthiessen s classic American Renaissance, published in 1941 in the midst of the Nazi aggression, Ishmael has been appropriated by critics intent upon finding in him the figure of resistance to totalitarianism and fulfillment of democratic freedom. Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity. But the Holocaust (the Shoah) effectively marks the final collapse of traditional Western humanism. Jewish thinkers such as George Steiner and Emmanuel Levinas have been reassessing this collapse and its consequences. Both suggest alternative Jewish humanisms that reread Western culture and literature through a "Holocaust hermeneutics" that ethicizes and morally impassions the act of reading, studying, and responding to texts, and that elevates the role of the textual and human Other to one of primacy and priority. Rereading Moby-Dick under Steinerian and Levinasian norms reveals an Ishmael whose dealings with the Other pose troubling ethical questions in a post-Shoah world, and challenges the traditional "Cold War consensus" that makes of Ishmael the American emblem of Western freedom and humanitarianism  Subject  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEAHey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEA  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe?

Logan Smalley and Stephanie Kent were at a bar one evening in New York when the conversation turned to books, and specifically, to first sentences of novels. In any such conversation, three words in particular are invariably mentioned: “Call me Ishmael,” the iconic opening of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. What came next was a question that in hindsight, seems unthinkable no one had ever asked before: What if you really could call Ishmael? “We quickly realized that it was a pun worth keeping,” Smalley said.  Smalley and Kent set to work creating Call Me Ishmael , a platform for people to tell personal stories about books they love, with the hopes of connecting people with their next great read. They set up a cell phone number for Ishmael, which goes straight to voice mail and prompts people to anonymously leave a message about “a book you’ve loved and a story you’ve lived.” A few\xa0times a week, Smalley transcribes a message by typewriter, filming the text as it scrolls up the typewriter carriage in time to the audio.  Although Smalley is no literary luddite—he and Kent both read and e-read—he said this particular project called for something more tangible than is typical in our digital age. “[People] want to call a complete stranger and tell them the really profound and potentially really personal story about how a book has affected them,” said Smalley. “That exchange, to us, necessitates something that feels very handmade and safe and comfortable, and gets a legitimate treatment.

From 1935 until his death, he published 12 novels, two short-story collections and eight plays.  White\'s fiction employs humour, florid prose, shifting narrative vantage points and a stream of consciousness technique. In 1973, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature—and was the only Australian citizen to have been awarded the Literature prize until J. M. Coetzee became an Australian citizen in 2006. The Vivisector, a novel about the life and times of a successful modernist painter, was shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010.  White was born in Knightsbridge, London, to an English-Australian father and an English mother. His family later moved to Sydney, Australia when he was six months old. As a child he lived in one flat with his sister, nanny and a maid; while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  At the age of four White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White\'s health was fragile throughout his childhood which, while it precluded his participation in many childhood activities, stimulated his imagination. He would perform private rites in the garden and would dance for his mother’s friends. He loved the theatre which he first visited at an early age.  At the age of ten White was sent to Tudor House School, a boarding school in the New South Wales southern highlands, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school he started to write plays. Even at this early age White wrote about noticeably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble and the headmaster suggested that White be sent to public school in England; a suggestion which his parents accepted.  White struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at Cheltenham College. He later described it as "a four-year prison sentence". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant.  While in London White did make one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White’s biographer, David Marr, wrote that the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl\'s high kick ... with appropriate | Question: Which Nobel Prize did Patrick White win in 1973?', ['literature'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6847'), ('Context: "The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’, or simply ‘rule’". The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. | Question: The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?', ['distinction'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10042'), ('Context: The Dingoes  The Dingoes is an Australian country rock band initially active from 1973 to 1979, formed in Melbourne which relocated to the United States from 1976.

Van Dyck was endowed with more feeling than strength, he  offered apparently but little resistance to the influence of others, yet  his natural disposition and his fine artistic taste were not submerged  by the powerful impression made on him by his illustrious prede-  cessors. These impressions, it may be said, he outgrew rather than  threw off, and drifted unconsciously into an independence which  ripened and matured through the increasing power of his matchless  talent. Born in Antwerp, of the bluest blood, he loved his native town  and with true artistic feeling was carried away and enraptured by  all that may be called beautiful, brilliant and glowing ; he surpassed  all others by the sensibility of his character, by the distinction of his  style, by his power to charm and by his love of the eminent. The  tender graceful sensitiveness of his nature made him a striking contrast  to and a protest against that boorishness and sluggishness, which are  considered by some the characteristics of our nation.   Such van Dyck appears to us as artist when we take a broad and     impartial view of him, but upon a nearer acquaintance his talents  become more sharply defined, especially when viewed by the glimpses  we get of his life and from a closer examination of his work.   So too he appears to us as a man : of noble exterior, conscious of  his own worth, speaking by the spirit that vibrates through his whole  being and which overshadows his surroundings through the charm  of his personality. He looks what he is, the portrayer of princes, of  eminent men and of noble ladies, of Madonnas and Saints, and above  all the painter of the Man of Sorrows and the Mother of Woe.   Anthony was born in Antwerp on the 22nd March 1599. ^^is  father belonged to one of the highly respectable Burgher families  of the town. A few years ago the portrait of his Grandmother,  Cornelia Pruystinck, was discovered in the Modena Museum, and  the question arose whether the young artist had not perhaps copied  this picture from a portrait by some other artist ; van Dyck\'s  mother was celebrated | Question: Breugel; Van Dyck and Rubens were all citizens of which country?', ['belgium'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7578'), ('Context: Ballarat Bitter  Ballarat Bitter is a 4.9% (abv) Australian beer, originally brewed in Ballarat, Australia by the Ballarat Brewing Company.

He is most famous for his work on television as Johnny Carson\'s sidekick, announcer, and second banana on The Tonight Show from 1962 through 1992. He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.

This is from Wikipedia:  "The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner," and as such is related to the names of several other European regions where Germanic peoples came into contact with indigenous non-Germanic cultures, including: Wallonia (Belgium), Valais (Switzerland), and Wallachia (Romania), as well as the "-wall" of Cornwall and even the "wal-" in the walnut tree. However, it has also been suggested that the prefix "Wall" acknowledges a people who had contact with the Roman empire (see Vlach)."  Damian in Edinburgh \xa0 Tue Nov 06, 2007 9:18 am GMT  ***"The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner,"***  Ironically is indeed the operative word here.   As far as the English, particularly, are concerned, the Welsh people have always been considered more "foreign" than have the other constituent member races of the entire British Isles, including what is now the people of the Republic of Ireland, who, technically, are really foreigners.   Certainly we Scots have not been seen in quite the same light by the English as have the Welsh people as an entity.  I think that several factors are involved in this English perception of the Welsh as being "more foreign" - one being, of course, the survival of the Welsh Language, a Language seen as quite alien to English itself in so many ways.    There are characteristics of Welsh that are more similar to some Continental Languages than there are to English.   Bearing in mind the nature of the Welsh Language, you then have to consider the physical closeness of Wales to the main body of England geographically - ie the Midlands and Southern England generally, the areas most seen as the political powerhouse of England politically and culturally.  Here in Scotland we are considerably further away in distance from much of England (including London and the Home Counties) yet we are not seen as being as "foreign" as the Welsh as we do not have the "advantage" of a separate Language like they have.  Many English people feel a real sense of "difference" when crossing the border out of England and into Wales which they don\'t quite feel when driving out of England into Scotland.   I think that is entirely due to the sudden change from Anglo Saxon place names in England to the "foreign" looking Welsh place names in Wales - not to mention the fact that all road signs immediately become bi-lingual, including road markings ie "Araf" "meaning "Slow" painted on the road surfaces.  Each time I\'ve driven over the English/Welsh border (four times now) I noticed that at first the English word took precedence above the Welsh word, but the further into Wales you go - ie further into the strongholds of the still surviving (and flourishing) Welsh Language the Welsh word takes precedence.  This simply doesn\'t happen when travelling back and forth over the Scottish / English border which I have done countless numbers of times - if I had a quid for each time I\'ve crossed the border I\'d have a bloody good holiday on one of the Greek islands....or take a cruise down the Nile..I\'d love to go and take a peek at the newly resurrected King Tut.

Pope's paternal grandfather is supposed to have been Alexander Pope, rector of Thruxton, Hampshire (instituted 1 May 1630–1; information from the Winchester bishop's register, communicated by Mr. J. C. Smith, of Somerset House), who died in 1645. The poet's father, according to his epitaph, was seventy-five at his death, 23 Oct. 1717, and therefore born in 1641 or 1642 (see also P. T.'s letter to Curll in Pope's Works, by Elwin and Courthope, vi. 423, where he is said to have been a posthumous son). According to Warton, he was a merchant at Lisbon, where he was converted to catholicism. He was afterwards a linendraper in Broad Street, London. A first wife, Magdalen, was buried 12 Aug. 1679 (register of St. Benet Fink); he had by her a daughter Magdalen, afterwards Mrs. Rackett; and in the Pangbourne register, Ambrose Staveley, the rector, records the burial of 'Alexander Pope, son of my brother-in law, Alexander Pope, merchant of London,' on 1 Sept. 1682 ( information from Mr. J. C. Smith). Pope's statement in a note in the Epistle to Arbuthnot, that his father belonged to the family of the earls of Downe, appears to have been a fiction (Warton, Essay, ii. 255). The poet's maternal grandfather descended from a family of small landowners in Yorkshire. He had seventeen children, one of whom, Edith, the poet's mother, was baptised on 18 June 1642, though, according to her epitaph, she was ninety-three at her death on 7 June 1733. Christiana, another daughter, married the portrait-painter, Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) [q. v.], and at her death in 1693, left some china, pictures, and medals to her nephew. Three of her sons, according to Pope's statement (Epistle to Arbuthnot), were in the service of Charles I. Alexander Pope, the linendraper, after his second marriage, moved his business to Lombard Street. He made some money by his trade, and in or before 1700 moved to Binfield in Windsor Forest. It appears from his will (Carruthers, Pope, 1857, p. 463) that he had some landed property, and he also invested money in French rentes (Works, vi. 189, 201). The story, first told by Ruffhead, that he put all his money in a strong-box and lived upon the principal, is therefore erroneous. As a catholic, he was exposed to various disqualifications; but he appears to have lived comfortably among the country gentry. He had many friends among the Roman catholics, several of whom lived near the forest. He was fond of gardening, and had twenty acres of land round his house at Binfield. One room of the house is said to remain, and a row of Scottish firs near it was apparently there in Pope's time.  Pope was precocious, and in his infancy healthy. He was called the ‘little nightingale’ from the beauty of his voice, a name still applied to him in later years by the dramatist Southern (Ruffhead, p. 476; Orrery, Swift, p. 207). A portrait, painted when he was ten years old, showed him ‘plump and pretty, and of a fresh complexion.’ This is said to have been like him at the time; but a severe illness two years later, brought on by ‘perpetual application,’ ruined his health and distorted his figure (Spence | Question: What was the first name of the poet Mr. Pope, 1688-1744?", ['alexander'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1860'), ('Context: Money Trees  "Money Trees" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar, taken from his major label debut studio album "Good Kid, M.A.A.D City" (2012).

Peter Davison was chosen due to his critically acclaimed role as Tristan Farnon in the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small which had Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner as line producer . [1]  The Fifth Doctor\'s era was notable for a "back to the basics" attitude, in which "silly" humour (and, to an extent, horror) was kept to a minimum, and more scientific accuracy was encouraged by the producer, John Nathan-Turner . It was, at times, a darker and grittier series, in part for seeing the death of one of his companions, Adric . It was also notable for the reintroduction of many of the Time Lord \'s enemies, such as the Master , Cybermen , Omega (a founding-father of Gallifrey ), the Black and White Guardians , and the Silurians .  \xa0 Biography  The Fourth Doctor \'s regeneration into the Fifth was a problematic one, and nearly failed, with the Doctor briefly taking on personality aspects from his four previous incarnations. After recovering in the fictional city Castrovalva (actually an elaborate trap created by his arch-enemy The Master ), he continued his travels with Tegan Jovanka , Nyssa and Adric . Initially his travels centred on getting Tegan back to Heathrow Airport in time for her first day as an airhostess, but the TARDIS repeatedly missed this destination and Tegan eventually decided to stay in the TARDIS. After trips to the future and the past encountering villains such as Monarch and the Mara , the Fifth Doctor was confronted with tragedy when Adric died trying to stop a space freighter from crashing into prehistoric Earth ( Earthshock ).  Following Adric\'s death, the TARDIS accidentally arrived at Heathrow airport ( Time-Flight ). Here the Doctor and Nyssa left Tegan assuming she would want to stay (when in fact she did not any more). The Doctor and Nyssa then travelled together for an unspecified amount of time before the renegade Time Lord Omega , attempting to return to our universe, temporally bonded himself to the Doctor ( Arc of Infinity ). Faced with this threat, the Time Lords were forced to attempt executing the Doctor, but he eventually tracked Omega to Amsterdam where he defeated him and re-encountered Tegan (who having now lost her job, had no second thoughts about rejoining the TARDIS crew).  When the Doctor met a new companion , an alien boy stranded on Earth by the name of Vislor Turlough , he did not know that Turlough had been commissioned by the Black Guardian to kill him. Soon after, Nyssa left to help cure Lazar\'s Disease on the space station Terminus . After meeting the entities known as Eternals racing in yacht-like spacecraft for the prize of " Enlightenment ", Turlough broke free from the Black Guardian\'s influence, and continued to travel with the Doctor and Tegan. Landing in the reign of King John, the crew again encountered The Master, who was using a shape-shifting robot Kamelion to impersonate the King. However, the Doctor helped Kamelion to regain his free will and the robot joined him in his travels (although he rarely left the TARDIS). The Doctor met three of his previous incarnations when they were summoned to the Death Zone on Gallifrey by President Borusa , who was attempting to gain Rassilon \'s secret of immortality.  After further adventures in which the Doctor re-encountered old foes, including the Silurians and the Sea Devils , both Tegan and Turlough left the TARDIS.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas.

He was shuttling back and forth between his home in L.A. and the studio in New York working on the vocals for the Stoned Soul Picnic album when the group told him they wanted to do "Aquarius."  "The thing that bothered me about it was that there\'d been other releases of \'Aquarius,\'" said Bones, "and none had done anything, so I was concerned about what we would do that would be any different. I went to see the show and there\'s a place where they do "The Flesh Failures" and at the end of the song is just a three bar repeated thing of \'Let the sunshine in\' where Ragni was swinging across the stage on a chandelier and there was all kinds of craziness going on. That really stayed with me and I came out of the theater saying, I wonder if I could stick that on the end of \'Aquarius\' and make that the ending. So I went back to the hotel and I called the publisher. I mean you don\'t mess with the music from a Broadway show. I started my professional career in 1956 and I knew a lot about what you can and what you can\'t do with songs. I said, look the 5th Dimension would like to record \'Aquarius,\' but I\'d like to make it a medley and I\'d like to use the last three bars of \'The Flesh Failures\' and I don\'t want to do it without permission. So he said okay, you can go ahead and do it."  The next problem was to go ahead and do it. "The record was plotted in the fall of \'68 and more or less finished in January of \'69," Bones said. "I had to do a lot of work with my vocal arranger, Bob Alsivar. Because they couldn\'t sing both songs in the same key, we had to do a modulation; we figured out how I was going to do the instrumental arrangement so we could change keys. The record itself is the result of a conglomeration of things. I began as a jazz musician and I know the standard repertoire pretty well.

The decade was marked by sweeping social change and the domination of youth culture - baby boomers were growing up and demanded their own fashion style.  Designers responded with a much more liberal, daring approach to fashion, boasting colourful fabrics and bold designs.  The 1960s saw fashion reject the conventions and niceties of previous eras. Clothing broke with social traditions that dictated what could be worn when and by whom. In the past, attire had been divided in to 'formal' and 'casual' wear, and distinct separations were made between the styles of clothing worn by men and women. The 1960s, however, saw the emergence of unisex clothing such as denim jeans, which could be worn by both sexes.  1960s Mod fashion  Mod, short for 'modern', refers to a youth lifestyle that emerged from London during the 1960s, and quickly spread to America, Europe and Australia. Centred around London's thriving pop music, art and fashion scene, the mod lifestyle focused on innovation and the 'new'.  Mod fashion was slim fitting and featured bold geometric shapes. Colour was also a key concern - the conservative greys, browns and pastels of the 1950s were replaced by bright, wild hues. In contrast to fashion trends of the past, these garments were mass-produced and affordable.  Rising hemlines and the mini-skirt  The 1960s saw the appearance of the mini-skirt. Up until that time, skirts and dresses in Australia finished sensibly at the knee. New soaring hemlines created huge controversy when they first appeared, exposing centimetres of thigh never before seen in public.  At the Melbourne Cup in 1965, English model Jean Shrimpton created controversy by wearing a synthetic white shift dress with a hem high above her knees. She did not wear stockings, gloves or a hat. Shrimpton's outfit was considered scandalous, and made headlines around the world. By the end of the decade, however, shift dresses and mini-skirts had become widely accepted.  See Image 1  Mini-skirts represent more than just a fashion landmark of the decade - they have become an icon of the general culture of rebellion that characterised the 1960s. Young people were rejecting the social standards of the past and so too was their fashion. Many devotees of the feminist movement of the 1960s also saw the mini-skirt as a claim to the right of women to proudly display their bodies as they wished.  1960s Fashion icons  Throughout the 1960s, a number of famous people sported distinct fashion styles that were copied all over the world.  British teenage supermodel Leslie Hornby, also known as Twiggy due to her stick-thin figure, was a fashion idol to young girls everywhere. Her short, boyish haircut and leggy, waif-like frame graced the covers of every major fashion magazine.  While 1960s fashion was largely youth-driven, fashion icons also dictated the style of older women. Throughout her career, movie star Audrey Hepburn wore simple, flat shoes, three-quarter length pants, and plain black shift dresses. Her clothing style and her beehive hairdo, would be copied by millions of women worldwide.  See Image 2  Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of US President John F. Kennedy, became widely known for her beauty, grace and elegant style of dress. Her many public appearances popularised pearl necklaces, the pillbox hat (a small hat with a flat top and straight sides) and simple, big-buttoned suits.  1960s 'Hippie' fashion  Towards the end of the 1960s, the hippie movement had arrived in Australia.

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel\'s periodical, the Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation. The deluxe illustrated edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871, included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou.  The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne\'s greatest works, along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth. The description of Nemo\'s ship, called the Nautilus, was considered ahead of its time, as it accurately describes features on submarines, which at the time were very primitive vessels. Thus, the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories, unlike some of Verne\'s other works, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels.

The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ("Context: Much of the city's tax base dissipated, leading to problems with funding education, sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ("Context: According to tradition , the Nusaybah family took its name from a female companion or Sahabah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad named Nusaybah bint Ka'ab .

Lord Shiva portrayed with Sanskrit manuscripts of Hindu scriptures.\xa0 ExoticIndia.com  By Subhamoy Das  Updated August 02, 2015.  Arguably the world’s oldest extant language, Sanskrit is an ancient and classical language of India in which the Hindu scripture Rig Veda , regarded as the first ever book compiled by human beings, was written. In the words of the Indian scholar Sri Aurobindo , “Sanskrit language, as has been universally recognized by those competent to form a judgment, is one of the most magnificent, the most perfect, the most prominent and wonderfully sufficient literary instrument developed by the human mind.”  When Did Sanskrit Originate?  According to the Indian tradition, Sanskrit has no beginning or end. It is self-born, divine, eternal and everlasting. The Sanskrit language is believed to have evolved to its expressive capability prior to the composition of the Vedas, which can be dated back to 6500 - 1500 BC.\xa0 During this period a vast body of literary work including the Vedas , Brahmana-Granthas, Aranyakas, Upanishads and Vedangas, known as Vedic literature came to be written in 'Vedic Sanskrit,' an ancient form of present-day Sanskrit.  Each Veda had its book of grammar known as 'Pratishakhya.' \xa0The Pratishakhyas explained the forms of the words and other grammatical points, which gave rise to various schools of grammar.\xa0  The Development of Sanskrit Grammar  The ancient Hindu sage Panini , who lived around 500 BC, made a great stride in the development of Sanskrit language.\xa0 He, combining about ten grammar schools prevalent during his time, wrote the master book of grammar named Ashtadhyayi, which served as a beacon for the later period. Literary Sanskrit and spoken Sanskrit both followed Panini’s system of language.\xa0 Today, the correctness of Sanskrit language is still tested upon the touchstone of Panini’s Ashtadhyayi. Sanskrit is so scientific that experts find it the fittest language for computerization. It is precise and unambiguous and is accepted the world over as an ideal language for modern information technology.  The Family Tree of Sanskrit Language  Sanskrit is said to belong to the Indo-Aryan or Indo Germanic family of languages which includes Greek, and Latin.\xa0 The Anglo-Welsh Indologist William Jones , who was also a Greek and Latin scholar opined that Sanskrit is better than Greek or Latin .\xa0 He said, “The language of Sanskrit is of a wonderful structure, more perfect than Greek, more copious than Latin and more exquisitely refined than either.”\xa0  According to the German Orientalist Max Muller , “Sanskrit is the greatest language of the world.” And as such it can be regarded as “the mother of Europe’s languages,” as Will Durant put it. Such eulogy for this language is common: “Sanskrit is the unsurpassed zenith in the whole development of languages yet known to us” (Wilhelm von Humboldt) and the “intellectual debt of Europe to Sanskrit literature has been undeniably great.” (Prof. Macdonell).  Sanskrit, the Mother of Indian Languages  Sanskrit has been the source of later Indian languages and literature, especially Pali and Prakrit .\xa0 Pali was taken as means for exposition of Buddhist ideas and Prakrit was used for the spread of Jain doctrines.\xa0 Most of the Buddhist and Jain literature were written in these two languages as well as in Sanskrit.\xa0  Modern Indian languages used in Northern India, including the country’s official language Hindi, have evolved from Sanskrit. Other Indian languages of South India - Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu have evolved from the Dravidian family of languages, which have also been well enriched and nourished by Sanskrit.  Is the Sanskrit Language Dead?  Despite being ancient and classical, Sanskrit is still used as a medium of expression by scholars throughout India and other parts of the world including Germany and the United States.

While George is at school, his parents go to an orphanage where they meet and fall in love with a humanoid mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Despite misgivings from Mrs. Keeper (Julia Sweeney), they adopt Stuart and take him home. However, Stuart is greeted coldly by George, who refuses to acknowledge the mouse as his brother, and the family cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane), who is disgusted at having a mouse for a "master". Despite Eleanor and Frederick\'s intentions, Stuart quickly feels like an outsider in the large Little family, especially when the family\'s unknowing relatives bring Stuart large presents and George snaps at his family, claiming out loud that Stuart is not his brother. When Stuart admits his feelings of loneliness to his parents, they ask Mrs. Keeper to do some background research on Stuart\'s biological family.After accidentally stumbling across George\'s playroom in the basement, Stuart finally bonds with George when they play together and plan to finish George\'s remote controlled boat, the Wasp, for an upcoming boat race in Central Park. At the same time, however, one of Snowbell\'s alley cat friends, Monty (voiced by Steve Zahn) visits unexpectedly and discovers Stuart. Determined not to have his reputation destroyed, Snowbell meets with Monty\'s leader, Smokey (voiced by Chazz Palminteri), a mafia don-like alley cat, and plans to have Stuart removed from the household without harming him.Stuart and George finish the Wasp in time for the race, but on the day of the race, the control is smashed when a bystander accidentally steps on it. Stuart pilots the Wasp himself, but ends up in a tussle with a larger boat belonging to George\'s rival, Anton, who has already smashed the rest of the boats without being disqualified. Stuart snaps the wires of Anton\'s boat and manages to win the race, at the same time finally winning George\'s acceptance and respect. During the family celebration, however, the Little\'s are visited by a mouse couple, Reginald and Camille Stout (voiced by Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly), who claim to be Stuart\'s parents who gave him up to the orphanage years ago due to poverty. Reluctantly, Stuart leaves with the Stouts, George presenting him with his toy car as a farewell gift. A few days later, however, Mrs. Keeper comes to visit and tells the Little\'s that Stuart\'s parents actually died many years ago in a supermarket accident. Realizing their son has been kidnapped, the Little\'s call the police and stick posters of Stuart\'s face across the city.Meanwhile, Snowbell meets with Smokey and the alley cats: he had actually conspired with them to have the Stouts pose as Stuart\'s parents in order to remove Stuart from the household. Fearing retribution should the Little\'s discover Snowbell\'s deception, Smokey orders the Stouts to hand Stuart over to them, but the Stouts, having grown to truly love Stuart, tell him to flee. Smokey subsequently orders a manhunt for Stuart. They corner him in Central Park and a chase ensues. Despite losing his car and almost falling down a storm drain, Stuart manages to evade Smokey and return home, unfortunately, while the Little\'s are out putting posters up. The only one present is Snowbell, who lies that the Little\'s have been enjoying themselves greatly since Stuart\'s departure, and uses Stuart\'s removed face from the family photograph as proof (which they had actually used for the posters). Heartbroken, Stuart leaves again, but Snowbell begins to question his actions when he sees the pain the Little\'s are going through.The alley cats locate Stuart in Central Park and bring Snowbell for the hunt.

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK).

The members of the order strive to cultivate the ideals of the order’s founder. The Franciscans actually consist of three orders. The First Order comprises priests and lay brothers who have sworn to lead a life of prayer, preaching, and penance. This First Order is divided into three independent branches: the Friars Minor (O.F.M.), the Friars Minor Conventual (O.F.M. Conv.), and the Friars Minor Capuchin (O.F.M. Cap.). The Second Order consists of cloistered nuns who belong to the Order of St. Clare (O.S.C.) and are known as Poor Clares (P.C.). The Third Order consists of religious and lay men and women who try to emulate Saint Francis’ spirit by performing works of teaching, charity, and social service. Strictly speaking, the latter order consists of the Third Order Secular , whose lay members live in the world without vows; and the Third Order Regular, whose members live in religious communities under vow. Congregations of these religious men and women are numerous all over the Roman Catholic world. The Franciscans are the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic church. They have contributed six popes to the church.  It was probably in 1207 that Francis felt the call to a life of preaching, penance, and total poverty. He was soon joined by his first followers, to whom he gave a short and simple rule of life. In 1209 he and 11 of his followers journeyed to Rome, where Francis received approval of his rule from Pope Innocent III . Under this rule, Franciscan friars could own no possessions of any kind, either individually or communally (i.e., as the property of the order as a whole). The friars wandered and preached among the people, helping the poor and the sick. They supported themselves by working and by begging food, but they were forbidden to accept money either as payment for work or as alms. The Franciscans worked at first in Umbria and then in the rest of Italy and abroad. The impact of these street preachers and especially of their founder was immense, so that within 10 years they numbered 5,000. Affiliated with them were the Franciscan nuns, whose order was founded at Assisi in 1212, by St. Clare , who was under the guidance of St. Francis. Clare and her followers were lodged by Francis in the Church of San Damiano, where they lived a severe life of total poverty. They later became known as the Poor Clares or the Order of St. Clare.  Similar Topics  Cistercian  During the first years of the Franciscans, the example of Francis provided their real rule of life, but, as the order grew, it became clear that a revised rule was necessary. After preparing a rule in 1221 that was found too strict, Francis, with the help of several legal scholars, unwillingly composed the more restrained final rule in 1223. This rule was approved by Pope Honorius III .  Even before the death of Francis in 1226, conflicts had developed within the order over the observance of the vow of complete poverty . The rapid expansion of the order’s membership had created a need for settled monastic houses, but it was impossible to justify these if Francis’ rule of complete poverty was followed strictly. Three parties gradually appeared: the Zealots , who insisted on a literal observance of the primitive rule of poverty affecting communal as well as personal poverty; the Laxists, who favoured many mitigations; and the Moderates, or the Community , who wanted a legal structure that would permit some form of communal possessions. Something of an equilibrium was reached between these different schools of thought while St. Bonaventure was minister general (1257–74). Sometimes called the second founder of the order, he provided a wise, moderate interpretation of the rule. During this period the friars spread throughout Europe, while missionaries penetrated Syria and Africa.

Have you even heard of it? Whenever we hear about yogurt, the first thing that comes to mind is the white creamy dairy product that contains live and active cultures. It is often mixed with various kinds of fruits and comes with a sweet taste. But there is also a new type of yogurt that is available today called Greek Yogurt!  So what is Greek yogurt actually? First, Greek yogurt is a yogurt that is increasingly gaining popularity across the country. People love it for its distinctive taste and great health benefits. Greek yogurt is special. It is as thick as sour cream and carries a uniquely tangy flavor, and it contains significantly more protein and less sugar content than a regular yogurt.  Although Greek Yogurt may seem fairly recent, it has in fact been around for thousands of years. Originally known as labneh or strained yogurt, it was a staple in many countries across the Mediterranean region. While the yogurt is popularly named after Greek, Greece isn’t the only country with the culture of making this thick and rich yogurt. The synonymous name of Greek Yogurt is started with Fage, a brand name by a Greek owned company that makes Total Greek Yogurt, which later set the craze in the United States when everyone is passionate about healthy Mediterranean diets.  What Is Greek Yogurt Compared To Regular Yogurt?  While both Greek Yogurt and regular yogurt are made from pasteurized milks, they differ in the way they are processed. Basically, cream from the milk is removed and then bacteria are added to convert the milk lactose into lactic acid. This is how yogurt is made, but to make ‘Greek Style’ yogurt, an additional straining process of removing whey is made. The removal of whey also reduces the amount of carbohydrates as well as sugar content in the yogurt.  Also unlike typical American style yogurt, the milk that is used is made thicker by either boiling off some of the water content, or by adding powdered milk and butter fat to make it more concentrated. This is what makes Greek yogurt creamier and contains higher level of protein and fat.  It usually takes up to 3 pounds of milk to make a single pound of Greek yogurt. This is a reason why Greek Yogurt is more expensive than regular yogurt. It is not even surprising to see Greek yogurt costs up to three times as much.  While generally Greek Yogurt is a healthier choice, you do need to read the label carefully before purchasing one. Since you already know what is Greek yogurt made from, the thicker Greek Yogurt normally contains higher amount of calories and fat than a regular cup of traditional yogurt. But with today’s wide range of choice selections available, you should insist on getting one that is zero-fat or at least a low fat alternative. So you will get to enjoy the best of Greek Yogurt minus the extra calories and fat.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ('Context: Bobbi Bacha  Bobbi Bacha is a Texas Private Investigator portrayed in 2004 TV Sony Pictures Movie "Suburban Madness" played by actress Sela Ward.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.

NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.

Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

Suggs Biography (Wikipedia)  Graham McPherson (born 13 January 1961), better known as Suggs, is an English singer-songwriter, musician, radio personality and actor.  In a career spanning more than 30 years, Suggs came to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead singer of the English ska band Madness, which released fifteen singles that entered the Top 10 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1970s, 1980s and the 1990s, including "My Girl", "Baggy Trousers", "Embarrassment", "It Must Be Love", "House of Fun", "Driving in My Car", "Our House", "Wings of a Dove" and "Lovestruck". Suggs began his solo career in 1995, while still a member of Madness. Since then, he has released two studio albums, and two compilation albums. His solo hits include "I\'m Only Sleeping", "Camden Town", "Cecilia" and "Blue Day".  Suggs has also been an actor, with roles in films, theatre and television.

"Thirty bloody years I\'ve been wiv \'em." For a moment I think he\'s talking about his band, those baggy-trousered nutty boys; turns out he means his bank. They kept him waiting an hour and a half, despite three decades as a loyal customer – "and despite us shooting some of our best videos there as well".  But that\'s not the whole story of his tardiness for our rendezvous at Quo Vadis, his Soho club. En route from his home in Camden he bumped into Graham Coxon from Blur and an earnest discussion about the perils of the rock reunion soon necessitated strong drink. And there was another impediment for Suggs – an injured hand.  "Last night I was on the Mall with Buckingham Palace up ahead and Admiralty Arch – where John Prescott bonked his secretary – behind me and I just thought: \'London, my London – what tales lie therein.\' So when I saw this big pile of leaves I was so exhilarated that I just dived in. And that\'s how I hurt my hand."  Days can sometimes blend into nights for Suggs. I deduce this from the following greeting to Quo Vadis\'s manager: "Oi, Eduardo! You\'re still wearing last night\'s shirt with last night\'s stain – you dirty slag!" And once a day/night at least, he probably begins a sentence thus: "London, my London..."  London has always featured in Madness songs and they\'ve marked their 30th anniversary with The Liberty Of Norton Folgate, something of a London concept album, earning the band – Edinburgh\'s star attraction for the world\'s biggest Hogmanay street party – the best reviews of their career.  But how does Suggs respond to all London-loathers who think it too big, dirty, expensive, impersonal and up itself?

However, as the Reformation continued, Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity. In his later years, Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen (On the Jews and Their Lies) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times, although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme, even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe. In it, he takes a hardline against Judaism, writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed, their money confiscated, and liberty curtailed.

She is a beautiful princess with long, magical, golden hair who, with the aid of the handsome thief, Flynn Rider , leaves her isolated tower to explore the outside world.  Rapunzel is loosely based on the protagonist of the classic German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm . She is the tenth official Disney Princess and the first CGI-animated princess.  Contents  [ show ]  Background  Eighteen years before the events of Tangled, Rapunzel\'s parents, the beloved King and Queen of Corona , were anticipating their firstborn. Unfortunately, very late in her pregnancy, the Queen fell ill with what would surely result in her death, as well as her child\'s. Fearing the death of his love, the King dispatches multitudes of soldiers and villagers alongside the populace to search for a rumored magic flower , created by a single drop of sunlight, with the potential to heal illnesses.  The king and queen commemorate Rapunzel\'s birth with a floating lantern.  After much searching, the flower, long hoarded by a woman named Mother Gothel , who has kept herself young by singing a song to it, is miraculously located and boiled into a medicine to cure the queen of her ailment. With the help of the flower, the queen makes a full recovery and soon gives birth to a healthy baby girl, named Rapunzel who, unlike her parents, has beautiful, golden hair. To celebrate her birth, a floating lantern with the emblem of the sun was released into the sky amongst the people of Corona. The peace did not last long, however. Determined to retrieve the flower that kept her young for hundreds of years, Mother Gothel broke into the castle late one night and sang the song to Rapunzel\'s hair. Discovering that Rapunzel\'s hair retained the flower\'s healing powers. Gothel attempted to cut a piece off, only to find that the hair lost its magic and became brown. Frustrated and desperate, Gothel kidnapped the princess and fled to her tower, hidden within an alcove deep in the forest. To protect Rapunzel\'s hair, Gothel raised Rapunzel as her own daughter and taught her to sing the flower\'s song. To further ensure her magic supply was plentiful, Gothel continuously brushed the hair to further its growth. Although Rapunzel wished to leave the tower, Gothel warned her of a dangerous world beyond the tower walls, full of selfish people that desired to steal her hair and abuse her power.  Meanwhile, the kingdom searched far and wide for their missing princess, but to no avail. As a result, each year on Rapunzel\'s birthday, the King, Queen, and the entire kingdom release thousands of lanterns into the night sky, in hopes that, one day, their lost princess will return.  Official Description  Rapunzel is not a typical Disney Princess ; her blonde hair, which is 70 feet long, has the magical ability to heal and to reverse aging when she sings the special Healing Incantation . Kidnapped by Mother Gothel as an infant, Rapunzel is raised by Gothel and locked away in a tall tower up until her 18th birthday, when she is \'rescued\' by Flynn Rider. Rapunzel spends her time painting, cooking, candle-making, reading, brushing her hair, playing with Pascal , observing the outside world from within the tower, singing, and interacting with Mother Gothel. Being immensely fascinated by the floating lanterns that take place on her birthday each year, Rapunzel begins to develop a sense of curiosity and seeks to pursue her dream of seeing those " lights in the sky " one day. However, she has not overcome Mother Gothel\'s strict guardianship and thus has been staying in the tower, longing for the day when her life "begins."  Personality  Rapunzel is a spirited and determined young woman. Throughout her life, she\'s dreamt of escaping her tower to experience the outside world, but due to the strict order of her sole parental figure, Gothel, she\'s remained inside the | Question: Rapunzel, Mother Gothel and Paulo are all characters in which 2010 animated film?', ['tangled', 'healing incantation'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1198'), ('Context: In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term "Imperialism" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of "imperialism" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of "imperialism". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power. | Question: What was the idealized value of imperialism?', ['idealism and philanthropy', 'philanthropy'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10015'), ('Context: Alex the Dog  Alex the Dog was the advertising mascot for Stroh\'s beer in the 1980s and precursor to Budweiser\'s Spuds MacKenzie.

The Circuit:  Monaco is unique, and to many the annual blast round the streets of the tiny principality represents the jewel in the crown of Formula One. With its legendary casino and countless rows of millionaires' yachts in the harbour, Monaco is a glamorous place that lies at the very heart of the jet-set. It is also unique in that for many of the drivers the race is run on their doorstep, with the same streets they use for a daily trip to the newsagents, transformed into a race track.  Winding through the streets it is a circuit that has remained remarkably unchanged since the first race was staged in 1929. Before the war the circuit was witness to several great battles, with the legendary Tazio Nuvolari often among the winners. When World Championship racing began in 1950 Monaco played host to the second race, just a week after the first round at Silverstone. That race resulted in a massive pile-up on the very first lap and provided Fangio with his first ever championship victory. Since then the race has been plagued by a high attrition rate that has thrown up some unusual victories over the years. The combination of narrow roads, high kerbs and the close proximity of some unforgiving crash barriers, many a great driver has suffered at the hands of a track that quickly punishes the slightest error in judgement.  One memorable race came in 1955, the year that is best remembered for Alberto Ascari's trip into the harbour, a feat that was later emulated by the Australian driver Paul Hawkins. Both men survived their dunking although a number of driver's have not been so lucky. Luigi Fagioli was killed in a sports car race here in 1952 and Lorenzo Bandini was burned to death in 1967.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.

NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.

Did he copy ...Why did Hitler make his moustache like that? Did he copy from Charlie Chaplin? - Quora  Quora  Updated Jul 29, 2014  Hitler\'s moustache was a variation of an early 20th century style called the toothbrush mustache .\xa0 Before the toothbrush mustache became popular in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, the predominant German mustache style was the Kaiser mustache or "kaiserbart," named after German emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II .  Although such a mustache would be the envy of current Brooklyn hipsters, the Kaiser mustache would have been extremely difficult to maintain.\xa0 In order to acquire the standard version of the toothbrush mustache, all a German man would have to do is simply snip off the ends of the Kaiser mustache, thereby saving a lot of time in mustache maintenance.\xa0 A New York Times article from 1907 suggests that the mustache was an American import to Germany and that German men were largely adopting it for convenience\'s sake, because German women of the time tended to prefer the old-style Kaiser mustache.  The notorious Hitler mustache is a variation of the original toothbrush mustache, which makes the mustache even narrower so that it never protrudes beyond the bridge of the nose.\xa0 In addition, the Hitler mustache compensated for the narrower length of the mustache by keeping the facial hair under the nose bushier.\xa0 Before Hitler became famous, his variant of the toothbrush mustache was not particularly popular, often nicknamed as a "Rotzbremse" (German for "snot brake") by Bavarians.\xa0 In fact, Hitler may have adopted his style of mustache because it was unpopular, reasoning that it would make him look more distinctive from the masses. When Hitler\'s friend Ernst Hanfstaengl asked him why he kept such an ugly mustache, Hitler replied, "If it is not the fashion now, it will be later because I wear it."  According to a Vanity Fair article Becoming Hitler , which extensively discusses the Hitler mustache,  Experts disagree on the exact year Hitler began wearing the Toothbrush. Ron Rosenbaum , perhaps the only historian to give the mustache its proper due, fixes its appearance with confidence. "It was Chaplin\'s first, before Hitler\'s," he writes in an essay from The Secret Parts of Fortune . "Chaplin adopted a little black crepe blot beneath the nose for his Mack Sennett silent comedies after 1915, Hitler didn\'t adopt his until late 1919, and there\'s no evidence (though some speculation) that Hitler modeled his \'stache on that other actor\'s."  But some suggest Hitler began wearing it earlier. According to a recently re-discovered essay by Alexander Moritz Frey, who served with Hitler in the First World War, Hitler wore the mustache in the trenches. Because he had been ordered to. The old bushy mustache did not fit under his equipment. In other words, the mustache that defines Hitler was cut in a shape to fit a gas mask. Which is perfect. Because Hitler was the bastard son of the Great War, conceived in the trenches, born in defeat. He inhaled mustard gas and exhaled Zyklon B. In another memoir, dismissed by some as a fraud, Hitler\'s sister-in-law Bridget claims she was the cause of the mustache. Bridget Hitler was Irish and lived in Liverpool, where, according to the memoir, the young Adolf spent a lost winter. Bridget (or whoever) says she often bickered with her brother-in-law. Because he was disagreeable, but mostly because she could not stand his unruly \'stache. In one of the great inadvertent summaries of historical character, she writes that in this, as in everything, he went too far.  Despite the multiple conflicting accounts of when Hitler first wore his distinctive mustache, it is doubtful that he adopted it because of Charlie Chaplin. One simple reason that Charlie Chaplin is probably not the inspiration for Hitler\'s mustache is that self-consciously adopting the mustache of a silent film comedian would have invited people to ridicule Hitler, which would have stopped his rise to power in its tracks.\xa0 Instead, | Question: What notorious leader had a similar style mustache to Charlie Chaplin?', ['hitler'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3943'), ("Context: While most executive agencies have a single director , administrator , or secretary appointed by the President of the United States , independent agencies ( in the narrower sense of being outside presidential control ) almost always have a commission , board , or similar collegial body consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency .

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory.[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time. | Question: What may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in at any given time?", ['in effect', 'effect'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-7382'), ('Context: Making Cassata alla Siciliana, in Sicily - David LebovitzMaking Cassata alla Siciliana, in Sicily - David Lebovitz  Making Cassata alla Siciliana, in Sicily  51 comments -  06.23.2014  I didn’t want to cause a ruckus by sharing pictures of such a spectacular cake without a recipe. But on the other hand, it’s quite a chore to make a Cassata alla Siciliana and although Fabrizia Lanza sailed through it without breaking a sweat, between using the right pan, mixing up your own almond paste, finding ricotta as good as the ricotta in Sicily, and getting the candied fruit (including the squash, which is the translucent white brick on the platter), it might be classified as one of those things that’s better left to the Sicilians.  (Nevertheless, if you want to give it a go, Saveur printed her Cassata recipe, and it’s also in her book, Coming Home to Sicily . I linked to additional recipes at the end of the post.)  According to Italian food specialist Clifford A. Wright , the word Cassata is derived from the Arabic word quas’at, or qas’at, which refers to a wide bowl. There is actually a special pan to make the cake; it’s a mold with sloped sides and a groove around the bottom so that when Cassata mold is lined with strips of almond paste, and overturned, there’s a rim to create a neat guard against the icing from running down the sides.  I found out what the pan was for when I was making some pine nut praline for an ice cream I was going to churn up for her, made by caramelizing 1 part sugar then stirring in 1 part lightly toasted pine nuts, which get spread on a flat, greased surface, and left to cool. In my haste to find a flat pan in an unfamiliar kitchen, I grabbed one Fabrizia’s nice Cassata pans, as I was eyeing its flat, wide surface, perfect for spreading the praline.  I wasn’t able to find where, globally, you can get one online . But I did find some dynamite metal popsicle molds during my search.  Speaking of kitchen tools, I was wowed by this amazing, single-purpose Italian tool. When I asked Fabrizia where she got it, she replied, “In America.”  So somehow, people in the U.S. are able to roll the almond paste to fit snugly into the pan, but not actually find the right pan.  The first thing Fabrizia did was to make her own almond paste using finely ground almonds. Because I am a crunchy-granola California type, I asked if you could make the cake without the green food coloring.  Fabrizia laughed, but being Sicilian, she explained that Cassata is a cake for fun, festive occasions, and the vibrant green is part of the riot of colors that make the cake what it is meant to be. Although, perhaps bowing to overseas sensibilities, her mother, Anna Tasca Lanza said in one of her books that if you leave the green coloring out, you should pour the icing over the entire cake so that it hides the almond paste.  After cutting spongecake into strips to make a top layer for the cake, she whipped up a seriously good ricotta cream with the fresh sheeps’ milk ricotta we’d watched being made just the day before. Since she had a little extra, she tossed the bowl toward me with a spoon, and I dug right in.  Ladies and gentlemen, or signore e signori, no matter how far you are, if you are not booking a ticket to Sicily to taste sweetened sheeps’ milk ricotta cream, may the rest of your life be filled with neutral-colored almond paste. (ie: No fun at all.)  Because she knows that I love bergamots as much as she does, she doused the spongecake with homemade bergamot syrup, which gave me the idea to return in the winter, when the bergamot and citron trees are bearing fruit, and do some serious candying and syrup-making with her.

He\'d produced hits for the Turtles (" It Ain\'t Me Babe ") and the Association (" Windy "); he\'d been a personal guest of Lou Adler at the Monterey Pop Festival where he was perhaps the only West Coast guy in attendance to appreciate Laura Nyro\'s gruesome performance. Later he delivered Laura\'s "Stoned Soul Picnic" to the 5th Dimension, for which it was their biggest r&b hit. He was shuttling back and forth between his home in L.A. and the studio in New York working on the vocals for the Stoned Soul Picnic album when the group told him they wanted to do "Aquarius."  "The thing that bothered me about it was that there\'d been other releases of \'Aquarius,\'" said Bones, "and none had done anything, so I was concerned about what we would do that would be any different. I went to see the show and there\'s a place where they do "The Flesh Failures" and at the end of the song is just a three bar repeated thing of \'Let the sunshine in\' where Ragni was swinging across the stage on a chandelier and there was all kinds of craziness going on. That really stayed with me and I came out of the theater saying, I wonder if I could stick that on the end of \'Aquarius\' and make that the ending. So I went back to the hotel and I called the publisher. I mean you don\'t mess with the music from a Broadway show. I started my professional career in 1956 and I knew a lot about what you can and what you can\'t do with songs.

So he said okay, you can go ahead and do it."  The next problem was to go ahead and do it. "The record was plotted in the fall of \'68 and more or less finished in January of \'69," Bones said. "I had to do a lot of work with my vocal arranger, Bob Alsivar. Because they couldn\'t sing both songs in the same key, we had to do a modulation; we figured out how I was going to do the instrumental arrangement so we could change keys.

In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack rubisco, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store CO2 in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called C4 photosynthesis. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off CO2 and returns to the mesophyll. Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity. Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I—the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: Prehistoric technology is technology that predates recorded history .

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy.

Semenya won gold in the women\'s 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final. Semenya also won silver medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics, both in the 800 metres.  Following her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. She was withdrawn from international competition until 6 July 2010 when the IAAF cleared her to return to competition.  In 2010, the British magazine New Statesman included Semenya in a list of "50 People That Matter 2010".   Early life and education  Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in South Africa near Polokwane (back then called Pietersburg), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, "deep in South Africa\'s northern Limpopo province." She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a tomboy as a child.   Semenya attended Nthema Secondary School and now attends the University of Pretoria as a sports science student.   She began running as training for soccer.   Career  2008  In July Semenya participated in the 2008 World Junior Championships, and won the gold in the 800 m at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a time of 2:04.23.   2009  In the African Junior Championships Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.    With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone. The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date. It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by Zelda Pretorius at 1:58.85, and Zola Budd at 2:00.90, respectively.   The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it was "obliged to investigate" after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m\xa0– "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use."  The IAAF also asked Semenya to undergo a gender test after the win. News that the IAAF requested the test broke three hours before the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions."   In August Semenya won gold in the 800 metres at the World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final, again setting the fastest time of the year.   Gender test  Following her victory at the world championships, questions were raised about her gender.    The IAAF\'s handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticized the organization for its response to the incident.  Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as racist, as well as an affront to Semenya\'s privacy and human rights.   The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted."  The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a "rare medical condition" giving her an unfair competitive advantage. The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.  In an interview with South African magazine YOU Semenya stated, "God made me the way I am and I accept myself." She also took part in a makeover with the magazine.   On 7 September 2009, Wilfred Daniels, Semenya\'s coach with Athletics South Africa (ASA), resigned because he felt that ASA "did not advise Ms. Semenya properly". He apologised for personally having failed to protect her.

The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins), although that was not its primary purpose.  A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence.  As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat.  There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard the Lionheart, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site. | Question: What position did Ernest Newman hold at Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress?", ['Chaplain'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-989'), ('Context: Maggie May (musical)  Maggie May is a musical with a book by Alun Owen and music and lyrics by Lionel Bart.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  Special relationships exist between the measures of consecutive angles, opposite angles and opposite sides of a parallelogram. A square is the most straightforward parallelogram, because it has 2 sets of parallel sides. Naturally, all of its angles and sides match in length or measure.  Facts About a Parallelogram  (1) The degree measure of the four angles of a parallelogram add up to 360 degrees. Remember that all quadrilaterals (4 sided figures) have angles which add up to 360 degrees. Here's a sample:  Then: a + b + c + d = 360 degrees  (2) The degree measure of any two consecutive angles add up to 180 degrees.                 In parallelogram ABCD:  angle a + angle b = 180 degrees  angle b + angle c = 180 degrees  angle c + angle d = 180 degrees  angle a + angle d = 180 degrees  (3) Opposite angles have the same measure in terms of degrees.  In parallelogram ABCD:  (1) Opposite sides are parallel:  side AD || side BC  NOTE: The symbol || means parallel.  (2) Opposite sides have the same lengths:  side AD = side BC  side AB = side CD  Diagonals of a Parallelogram  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two side-by-side triangles.  As shown in the picture below, diagonal AC forms equal alternate interior angles with each pair of parallel sides.  We can also see that there are two triangles in the picture below.  Triangle 1 is congruent to triangle 2 by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Method.  Where did the two triangles come from?  They were formed by diagonal AC.  I should also note that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other as shown in the picture below.  AE = EC  where E is the midpoint of BOTH diagonals.  Example:  In parallelogram WXYZ, the measure of angle X = 4a - 40 and the measure of angle Z | Question: The internal angles of a quadrilateral add up to how many degrees?", ['360'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5362'), ('Context: The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness. Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of "formal" and "informal" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or "full-fledged colonial rule" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully. | Question: A forced trade agreement between two countries would be an example of what?', ['informal" imperialism', 'imperialism', 'Informal rule', '"informal" imperialism'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-9807'), ('Context: Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption, rather than income should be the measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US. Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that "the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality," and consumption is more important than income. According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986. The debate is summarized in "The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor" by journalist Thomas B. Edsall. Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality, and the CBO\'s study found consumption data not "adequately" capturing "consumption by high-income households" as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income. | Question: What political leaning does the Cato Institute have?', ['libertarian'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-7281')]
