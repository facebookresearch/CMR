In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000. Wade only traveled to the Australian Open five times, but in 1972 stung another No. 1 seed when defeating crowd favorite and native Evonne Goolagong, who was in the midst of playing in seven consecutive Australian finals, | Question: Prior to Viginia Wade in 1977 who was the last British player to win a tennis Grand Slam title?', ['sue barker'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5406'), ("Context: Steve Carell as Felonious Gru , the former villain turned Anti-Villain League agent , Margo , Edith , and Agnes ' adoptive father , and Lucy 's husband .

Over time my products became more and more popular so the name Bodhi came about to keep it short and simple. Bodhi comes from the Bodhi Tree which is a type of fig tree. The Bodhi tree has played an important part in human history featuring strongly in religious history and mythology in various parts of the world.  The ficus religiosa, Bodhi tree, has large heart shaped leaves. It is one of the most sacred trees in India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it is venerated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The tree under which Siddhartha Gautama gained enlightenment over 2,600 years ago still grows today in North East India.  In Hindu religion, Vishnu is said to have been born under a Bodhi tree and is often depicted sitting on its heart-shaped leaves. The Bodhi tree is often planted in the grounds of temples and, of all the sacred trees of India, it is the most widely worshiped.  The Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka is located in Anuradhapura and is said to be the oldest tree in the world with a known planting date. This fig tree is said to have grown from a branch taken from the original Bodhi tree in India under which Buddha gained enlightenment.

It is the place where Prince Siddhartha Guatama, while meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.  Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it. As a young man, following the ancient traditions of Hinduism, he sought out spiritual teachers. Inquiring of their knowledge, he diligently practiced various yogas and meditations. Seven years passed, the last three in extreme asceticism, yet still he had not achieved his goal of enlightenment.  Impression of Buddha feet, Bodh Gaya \xa0\xa0\xa0  Siddhartha then journeyed toward the ancient sacred forests of Uruvela (modern Gaya in Bihar, in north India) with the intention of finally and completely realizing the infinite. Guided by visionary dreams and following in the footsteps of the Buddhas of three previous ages, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni and Kasyapa (who had each attained enlightenment at the site) Siddhartha sat beneath the Bodhi Tree. Touching the earth, thereby calling it to witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment, he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.  "Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve, but my body will not move from this seat until I have attained Enlightenment, so difficult to obtain in the course of great periods of time".  As Siddhartha sat in deep meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, Mara, the Dark Lord of Death, came to distract him from his endeavor. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama\'s words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Siddhartha\'s wisdom broke through Mara’s illusions. The power of his compassion transformed the demons\' weapons into flowers and Mara and all his forces fled. Three days and nights passed and Siddhartha’s intention was realized. He became the Buddha, meaning the ‘Enlightened One’.

The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market".

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them.

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ("Context: Doctor Who has appeared on stage numerous times.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell .

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729')]

Berthing in Nigeria in 1992, this entertainment industry popularly known as Nollywood is acclaimed by industry players to rank as the third largest movie industry in the world after India’s Bollywood and America’s Nollywood. According to movie scholars and critics, Nollywood industry, which despite its relative young emergence in the global movie market has successfully become an enviable artistic cultural vehicle with which African narrative is communicated to the world, ironically emerged as a child of necessity to fill the gap created by the total collapse of the country’s theatre and stage culture.  According to industry sources, the failure of government in providing adequate security surveillance over life and property in the late 80s’and early 90s’resulted in the very negative manner at which the public viewed public shows, especially as it had to do with cinema, stage and theatrical performances with disenchantment.  Video filmartistes at a film shooting site  Also added to this ugly development “was the fact that there were inadequate television stations across the country with enough entertainment contents to satisfy the yearning needs of the viewing public, a development that led\xa0content providers to seek alternative.”  “Nollywood was a child of necessity” says Professor Ahmed Yerima, theatre artiste and former Artistic Director of The National Troupe of Nigeria. He said: “There were very few television stations and we got to a point where the TV stations that existed needed you, the producer, to get sponsorship for your productions.”  Movie-theatre going culture  But for Obby Patrick Ebewo, Nigerian born and American based film scholar, “The collapse of movie-theatre going culture in the 1980s caused by incessant harassment of innocent citizen by criminals, the country’s economic downturn and various problems affecting celluloid film production, gave rise to video film.”  The implication of this new development, according to Yerima, was that fast thinking and business minded entrepreneurs cashed into the opportunity provided by this yearning need; and aided with the arrival of VHS tapes embarked on a business trial and experimentation that was to transform the continent’s entertainment turf.  Prior to this boom, efforts had been made by some dramatists to evolve a film culture in Nigeria. It is on record that as early as the 1960s’ theatre artistes in the mould of Hubert Ogunde, had recorded his plays on celluloid. Other artistes like Moses Adejumo and Duro Ladipo had equally attempted to reduce the cinematic art of film to a more popular medium for social commentary.  In an effort to trace the emergence of Nollywood and the entire film culture in the country, Ebewo argues that “the current video film industry in Nigeria owes a huge debt to the pioneering efforts of Nigerian theatre, particularly practitioners of the Yoruba Travelling theatre, who branched off from mainstream theatre to experiment with celluloid.”  However, the Nollywood brand today owes its projection and commercial resourcefulness to Kenneth Nnebue, who according to market consensus, pioneered the raving popular media brand with his movie, Living in Bondage, in 1992.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000. Wade only traveled to the Australian Open five times, but in 1972 stung another No. 1 seed when defeating crowd favorite and native Evonne Goolagong, who was in the midst of playing in seven consecutive Australian finals, | Question: Prior to Viginia Wade in 1977 who was the last British player to win a tennis Grand Slam title?', ['sue barker'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5406'), ('Context: That Was the Week That WasThat Was the Week That Was, informally TWTWTW or TW3, was a satirical television comedy programme on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.

The  revolver was an ivory handled .44 caliber british bulldog. He Checked  into the Riggs House hotel room 222 on the night before he was to  execute his plan.  Guiteau  arrived at the rail station early on July 2, and lay in wait for the  President to arrive, lurking about the train station to find the proper  attack point. Garfield was en route while Guiteau waited feverishly.  President James Garfield planned to leave Washington D.C. around 9:30 in the morning on July 2,  1881 from the Baltimore & Potomac train station. He was going to meet  up with First Lady Lucretia Garfield in Massachusetts for a long awaited and deserved vacation.  Garfield arrived at the rail station with Secretary of State James G. Blaine. In  another carriage just behind, followed Garfield\'s two oldest sons, while Lucretia in poor health and still recovering, was resting in a New  Jersey resort and preparing for travel.  Garfield and Secretary Blaine  arrived at the train station and were making their way through the  crowds as Guiteau approached them from behind. Guiteau raised his  gun, aimed, fired and the first shot grazed and stunned the President. He then fired  a second shot that struck the President forcefully and lodged deep into his  back. Garfield slumped to the tile floor, looking on as Guiteau was pounced upon, quickly subdued and arrested. Guiteau requested to be taken to jail at once and he was obliged.  Guiteau  Left a letter to be found the morning of the shooting addressed to  General William Tecumseh Sherman: July 2, 1881. It Read...  "I  have just shot the President. I shot him several times, as I wished him  to go as easily as possible...I am going to the jail. Please order out  your troops and take possession of the jail at once."  Dr.  Smith Townsend was the first doctor to reach Garfield and attempt  treatment of his gunshot wounds.

The bullet was never found by Bells  invention nor during any of the intrusive probing by doctors unwashed  hands. It wouldn\'t be until Garfield\'s death and an autopsy was  performed that the discovery was made. The bullets path deviated to the  left and rested just behind the pancreas.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml .

Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567.

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds. The name “unmodified round brilliant” was applied to a symmetrical round cut with a regular array of 58 facets, cut to modern standards. The system was the culmination of years of research that included the results of preference testing among a wide variety of groups, including trade professionals and consumers.  GIA designed the system to assess the design quality and craftsmanship of diamonds cut in the standard round brilliant style when compared to modern preferences. | Question: A modern round brilliant cut has 58 what?", ['facets'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3808'), ('Context: Great Train Robbery Anniversary - Heart Beds, Bucks ...Great Train Robbery Anniversary - Heart Beds, Bucks & Herts News  Great Train Robbery Anniversary  Great Train Robbery Anniversary  See pictures of the bridge near Leighton Buzzard where The Great Train Robbery took place fifty years ago.

Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.

The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. At any moment in time many individual lattice atoms will be away from their perfect lattice sites and this interferes with electron movement.  When the temperature coefficient is known, an adjusted resistivity value can be computed using the following formula:  R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1–T2)]  Where: R1 = resistivity value adjusted | Question: What electrical property, the reciprocal of resistivity, has the SI units Siemens per metre?', ['conductivity'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4196'), ('Context: In Hinduism the spiritual teacher is known as a guru, and, in many traditions of Hinduism - especially those common in the West - the emphasis on spiritual mentorship is extremely high, with gurus often exercising a great deal of control over the lives of their disciples. | Question: In what area is it common for spiritual mentorship to be extremely high?', ['the West'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-2069'), ('Context: Leni Junker  Helene "Leni" Junker (later Thymm; 8 December 1905 – 9 February 1997) was a German sprint runner who competed at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient\'s duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP\'s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don\'t deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas!

Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery  Cholecystectomy: Removal of the Gallbladder  The gallbladder is a small organ that is part of the human digestive system. It secretes bile, an enzyme that breaks down fats in food. Sometimes the gallbladder cannot work effectively, and instead of breaking down fats it begins to form lumps known as gallstones. When this happens, removal of the gallbladder – known as a cholecystectomy – may be necessary.  Traditional vs. laparoscopic cholecystectomy  Traditional cholecystectomy involved making a major incision and dislodging the liver in order to remove the gall bladder. This procedure was risky and required several days in the hospital as well as more than a month of recovery time.  The modern alternative, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, was developed in 1989. This procedure involves the insertion of a camera in a tube through the navel. Several small incisions are made, and the surgeon, guided by the camera, uses tiny instruments to cut the ducts and arteries that hold the gallbladder inside the body. When performed correctly, laparoscopic cholecystectomy poses less risk to the patient’s liver, reduces hospital stays, and cuts recovery time to less than a month. But laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an intricate and difficult procedure. Accidentally cutting or clipping the wrong duct or artery could have disastrous results for the patient.  Doctors performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy without proper experience  The best way for gallbladder patients to prevent complications from laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to choose a doctor who has performed many procedures. The National Institutes of Health became so concerned about the rate of patient injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy that a conference was convened to examine the issue. The conference found that training for laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been so irregular that an alarming number of doctors are not sufficiently competent to perform the procedure safely. Doctors with fewer than 25 procedures under their belts were more likely to identify the wrong duct or artery to cut and cause damage to the patient .  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy complications can be life-threatening  Because the gallbladder is situated close to many other vital organs (most prominently the liver), it is paramount that the surgeon performs the surgery correctly without cutting, clipping, or puncturing any other organs. When complications occur, they can include:  Jaundice  Infection or inflammation of the bile ducts causing digestive and liver problems  Damage to the liver, the intestines, or other nearby organs  Damage to the common bile duct, causing bile to enter the bloodstream or the abdominal cavity, thereby poisoning the patient  If the hepatic (liver) system is disrupted, or if the common bile duct is damaged, the patient is placed in a life-threatening situation that can swiftly degenerate to liver failure and even death. Emergency surgery is often required to correct complications of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and, even when it is successful, the patient may be sentenced to a life with permanent pain and impaired digestive function.

At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.

On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

It begins when tetanus bacteria enter the body, usually through a wound or cut exposed to contaminated soil. Tetanus is easily preventable through vaccination .  Description  Tetanus is rare in the United States, with nearly all cases occurring in adults who were not vaccinated as children. About 100 cases are reported each year; 63% of these occur in people over the age of 50. The number of tetanus cases in the United States has steadily decreased since the 1940s (500 to 600 cases per year); the number of reported cases has remained at approximately 50 to 100 cases per year since the mid-1970s. In 1999, however, the lowest number of annual cases to date was reported (33, or 0.02 per 100,000).  Tetanus causes convulsive muscle spasms and rigidity that can lead to respiratory paralysis and death . It is sometimes called "lockjaw" because one of the most common symptoms is a stiff jaw, unable to be opened. Sometimes, tetanus affects only the part of the body where the infection began, but in almost all of reported cases, it spreads to the entire body. The incubation period from the time of the injury until the first symptoms appear ranges from two to 50 days. Symptoms usually occur within five to 10 days. When symptoms occur early, the chance of death is increased. Tetanus is not contagious.  Causes and symptoms  Tetanus is caused by a bacteria called Clostridium tetani, whose spores (the dormant form) are found in soil, street dust, and animal (or even human) feces. Tetanus spores germinate in the body, producing a highly poisonous neurotoxin in the blood, spreading to the nervous system. The infection is usually transmitted through deep puncture wounds or cuts or scratches that are not cleaned well. Between 1997 and 1999, approximately 64% of tetanus cases in the United States were associated with such wounds as punctures, lacerations, or abrasions. Many people associate tetanus with rusty nails and other dirty objects, but any wound can be a source. Less common ways of getting tetanus are animal scratches and bites, surgical wounds, dental work, and therapeutic abortion. About 18% of cases reported between 1997 and 1999 were a result of intravenous drug use. Cases have also been reported in people with no known wound or medical condition.  The first symptom of tetanus is often a stiff or "locked" jaw that prevents the patient from opening his/her mouth or swallowing. This is also called trismus and results in a facial expression called a sardonic smile (or risus sardonicus). Stiffness of the neck and other muscles throughout the body and uncontrollable spasms often follow. Sometimes these convulsions are severe enough to cause broken bones. The bacterial toxin (tetanospasmin) affects the nerve endings, causing a continuous stimulation of muscles. Other symptoms include irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, and drooling.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines.

The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.  A Last Hurrah  In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.  \xa0  Final Stop  After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.  \xa0  The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.  \xa0  At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery - Schwartzapfel ...Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery - Schwartzapfel Lawyers P.C.  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery  Cholecystectomy: Removal of the Gallbladder  The gallbladder is a small organ that is part of the human digestive system. It secretes bile, an enzyme that breaks down fats in food. Sometimes the gallbladder cannot work effectively, and instead of breaking down fats it begins to form lumps known as gallstones. When this happens, removal of the gallbladder – known as a cholecystectomy – may be necessary.  Traditional vs. laparoscopic cholecystectomy  Traditional cholecystectomy involved making a major incision and dislodging the liver in order to remove the gall bladder. This procedure was risky and required several days in the hospital as well as more than a month of recovery time.  The modern alternative, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, was developed in 1989. This procedure involves the insertion of a camera in a tube through the navel. Several small incisions are made, and the surgeon, guided by the camera, uses tiny instruments to cut the ducts and arteries that hold the gallbladder inside the body. When performed correctly, laparoscopic cholecystectomy poses less risk to the patient’s liver, reduces hospital stays, and cuts recovery time to less than a month. But laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an intricate and difficult procedure. Accidentally cutting or clipping the wrong duct or artery could have disastrous results for the patient.  Doctors performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy without proper experience  The best way for gallbladder patients to prevent complications from laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to choose a doctor who has performed many procedures. The National Institutes of Health became so concerned about the rate of patient injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy that a conference was convened to examine the issue. The conference found that training for laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been so irregular that an alarming number of doctors are not sufficiently competent to perform the procedure safely. Doctors with fewer than 25 procedures under their belts were more likely to identify the wrong duct or artery to cut and cause damage to the patient .  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy complications can be life-threatening  Because the gallbladder is situated close to many other vital organs (most prominently the liver), it is paramount that the surgeon performs the surgery correctly without cutting, clipping, or puncturing any other organs. When complications occur, they can include:  Jaundice  Infection or inflammation of the bile ducts causing digestive and liver problems  Damage to the liver, the intestines, or other nearby organs  Damage to the common bile duct, causing bile to enter the bloodstream or the abdominal cavity, thereby poisoning the patient  If the hepatic (liver) system is disrupted, or if the common bile duct is damaged, the patient is placed in a life-threatening situation that can swiftly degenerate to liver failure and even death. Emergency surgery is often required to correct complications of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and, even when it is successful, the patient may be sentenced to a life with permanent pain and impaired digestive function.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.

The film was shot using locations around Melbourne, Victoria.   Eddie Leonski  Edward Joseph Leonski (December 12, 1917 – November 9, 1942) was an American soldier and serial killer responsible for the strangling murders of three women in Melbourne, Australia.  Leonski was known as the "Brownout Strangler", given Melbourne\'s wartime status of keeping low lighting (not as stringent as a wartime blackout).  His self-confessed motive for the killings was a twisted fascination with female voices, especially when they were singing, and his claim that he killed the women to "get at their voices." | Question: which American soldier and serial killer was Death of a Soldier based on ?', ['Edward Joseph Leonski'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-1289'), ('Context: Tim O\'Kelly  Tim O\'Kelly (born Timothy Patrick Wright, March 12, 1941 – January 4, 1990) was an American actor best known for playing the homicidal sniper Bobby Thompson in the Peter Bogdanovich cult film "Targets" (1968).

As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS ("zeal"), devoted to Jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.

A:  Quick Answer  In the Greek mythology story of Theseus and the Minotaur, King Minos of Crete ordered the labyrinth to be built as a way of housing a fierce half-man, half-bull creature known as the Minotaur, to whom seven young men and seven young women from Athens would be sacrificed each year. According to the myth, the labyrinth is a massive maze-like structure built by a man named Daedalus at the behest of King Minos; the maze that Daedalus constructed was so incredibly complex that even he could barely make his way through it. The hero Theseus ends up offering himself as a tribute to be sacrificed in the labyrinth, though his intention is to kill the Minotaur or die trying.

Europa's husband was the king of Crete, Asterion, who looked over the boys as he his own. \xa0The three sons were Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus.\xa0These three men, after death were made judge in the underworld.

When Asterion died, it was unclear which of the three sons should ascend to power. But it was Minos whose name actually means king, who was fated to be king of Crete. \xa0But Minos' \xa0ascension to power was a difficult journey, he competed for the kingship of Crete with his brothers.

This confirmed to all concerned that Minos was their true king. When Minos saw the beautiful white bull, he refused to sacrifice it to Poseidon and replace it with another.\xa0Angered with Minos, Poseidon plotted to punish him for his arrogance. So Poseidon turned the bull wild and\xa0implanted sexual desire \xa0towards bull in\xa0 Pasiphae (wife of Minos).\xa0Pasiphae mated with bull and gave birth to\xa0Asterius, who was called Minotaur (Minotaur was a monster half man and half bull).\xa0  Pasiphae and the Bull  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Pasiphae nursed Minotaur, but he grew and became ferocious, being the unnatural offspring of a woman and a beast, he had no natural source of nourishment and thus devoured man for sustenance.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  Special relationships exist between the measures of consecutive angles, opposite angles and opposite sides of a parallelogram. A square is the most straightforward parallelogram, because it has 2 sets of parallel sides. Naturally, all of its angles and sides match in length or measure.  Facts About a Parallelogram  (1) The degree measure of the four angles of a parallelogram add up to 360 degrees. Remember that all quadrilaterals (4 sided figures) have angles which add up to 360 degrees. Here's a sample:  Then: a + b + c + d = 360 degrees  (2) The degree measure of any two consecutive angles add up to 180 degrees.                 In parallelogram ABCD:  angle a + angle b = 180 degrees  angle b + angle c = 180 degrees  angle c + angle d = 180 degrees  angle a + angle d = 180 degrees  (3) Opposite angles have the same measure in terms of degrees.  In parallelogram ABCD:  (1) Opposite sides are parallel:  side AD || side BC  NOTE: The symbol || means parallel.  (2) Opposite sides have the same lengths:  side AD = side BC  side AB = side CD  Diagonals of a Parallelogram  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two side-by-side triangles.  As shown in the picture below, diagonal AC forms equal alternate interior angles with each pair of parallel sides.  We can also see that there are two triangles in the picture below.  Triangle 1 is congruent to triangle 2 by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Method.  Where did the two triangles come from?  They were formed by diagonal AC.  I should also note that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other as shown in the picture below.  AE = EC  where E is the midpoint of BOTH diagonals.

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil\'s people", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "scharfe Barmherzigkeit" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames." Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews\' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these "envenomed worms" would be forced into labour or expelled "for all time". In Robert Michael\'s view, Luther\'s words "We are at fault in not slaying them" amounted to a sanction for murder.

When the bacteria invade the body, they produce a poison (toxin) that causes painful muscle contractions. Another name for tetanus is "lockjaw" because it often causes a person\'s neck and jaw muscles to lock, making it hard to open the mouth or swallow. Vaccines are recommended for infants, children, teens, and adults to prevent tetanus.  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical ...Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Tetanus+disease  \xa0  Definition  Tetanus is a rare but often fatal disease that affects the central nervous system by causing painful muscular contractions. It begins when tetanus bacteria enter the body, usually through a wound or cut exposed to contaminated soil. Tetanus is easily preventable through vaccination .  Description  Tetanus is rare in the United States, with nearly all cases occurring in adults who were not vaccinated as children. About 100 cases are reported each year; 63% of these occur in people over the age of 50. The number of tetanus cases in the United States has steadily decreased since the 1940s (500 to 600 cases per year); the number of reported cases has remained at approximately 50 to 100 cases per year since the mid-1970s. In 1999, however, the lowest number of annual cases to date was reported (33, or 0.02 per 100,000).  Tetanus causes convulsive muscle spasms and rigidity that can lead to respiratory paralysis and death . It is sometimes called "lockjaw" because one of the most common symptoms is a stiff jaw, unable to be opened. Sometimes, tetanus affects only the part of the body where the infection began, but in almost all of reported cases, it spreads to the entire body. The incubation period from the time of the injury until the first symptoms appear ranges from two to 50 days. Symptoms usually occur within five to 10 days. When symptoms occur early, the chance of death is increased. Tetanus is not contagious.  Causes and symptoms  Tetanus is caused by a bacteria called Clostridium tetani, whose spores (the dormant form) are found in soil, street dust, and animal (or even human) feces. Tetanus spores germinate in the body, producing a highly poisonous neurotoxin in the blood, spreading to the nervous system. The infection is usually transmitted through deep puncture wounds or cuts or scratches that are not cleaned well. Between 1997 and 1999, approximately 64% of tetanus cases in the United States were associated with such wounds as punctures, lacerations, or abrasions. Many people associate tetanus with rusty nails and other dirty objects, but any wound can be a source. Less common ways of getting tetanus are animal scratches and bites, surgical wounds, dental work, and therapeutic abortion. About 18% of cases reported between 1997 and 1999 were a result of intravenous drug use. Cases have also been reported in people with no known wound or medical condition.  The first symptom of tetanus is often a stiff or "locked" jaw that prevents the patient from opening his/her mouth or swallowing. This is also called trismus and results in a facial expression called a sardonic smile (or risus sardonicus). Stiffness of the neck and other muscles throughout the body and uncontrollable spasms often follow. Sometimes these convulsions are severe enough to cause broken bones. The bacterial toxin (tetanospasmin) affects the nerve endings, causing a continuous stimulation of muscles. Other symptoms include irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, and drooling. People with tetanus that is localized experience pain and tingling only at the wound site and spasms in nearby muscles.  In the underdeveloped world, neonatal tetanus accounts for about one-half of tetanus deaths and is related to infection of the umbilical stump in a baby born of an unimmunized mother. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that over 270,000 deaths occur annually worldwide as a result of neonatal tetanus. In contrast, only two cases of neonatal tetanus in the United | Question: Which disease is also called lockjaw?', ['tetanus'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7253'), ("Context: Camp David | A History of the Presidential RetreatCamp David | A History of the Presidential Retreat  Presidential Factfile  For more than 50 years now, when presidents have wanted privacy, they have sought the cool, secluded lodges and cabins of Camp David , the presidential retreat tucked away in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.  Presidents have entertained visiting heads of state, such a former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , conducted cabinet meetings, and briefed Congressional leaders at the retreat. The 1978 Middle East peace talks concluded with what have become known as the Camp David Accords. Yet few Americans know much about the place, considering its prominence.  Federal Summer Camp  It all started in 1935, when the Work Projects Administration , WPA, began building the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area Project near Thurmont, Maryland, as an example of creating parks from worn-out agricultural land.  Three years later, the area opened as a camp for federal government employees and their families. Known as Hi-Catoctin, the facility consisted of several small cabins, a dining hall, and a swimming pool. Covered with trees and 1,800 feet above sea level, the spot provided a cool respite from the near tropical humidity of the Washington, DC, area.  Meanwhile, immediately after America's entry into World War II, doctors for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt were urging the ailing president to find a place convenient to Washington, yet far enough away to escape the heat and political pressures of the city.  The presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was out of the question because of heightened security considerations imposed by the war. After a search committee considered two other sites on Furnace Mountain on the Virginia side of the Potomac River below Harper's Ferry; and Shenandoah National Park, Virginia; Roosevelt toured two sites in the Catoctin Mountains.  He picked Hi-Catoctin, issuing a set of instructions on how the buildings should be remodeled and asking for the construction of a main lodge, which resembled the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. The initial work cost $25,000. The camp was renamed the USS Shangri La, to follow up on the nautical connection, since many workers involved with the Potomac worked on the camp.  Popular Presidential Choice  Since Roosevelt inaugurated Shangri-La with a three-day visit beginning July 18, 1942, all subsequent presidents have made extensive use of the mountain top retreat.  President Harry Truman did not visit Shangri-La often because Bess, his wife, felt it was dull. However, when they did visit, the Trumans enjoyed Shangri-La. Truman's favorite sport was walking and he spent long hours wandering the mountain trails with a secret service agent in tow.  Renamed Camp David  President Dwight Eisenhower changed the name of the retreat to Camp David in honor of his grandson, David Eisenhower. Although he and his wife, Mamie, tended to use Camp David for private relaxation, Eisenhower held the first cabinet meeting ever to take place there. He also hosted British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David.  President John Kennedy and his family visited the camp often, enjoying the horseback riding and other recreational opportunities. Kennedy also allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use Camp David when he was not there.  President Lyndon Johnson held several important discussions with advisers on the Vietnam War, the crisis in the Dominican Republic, and other world events, at Camp David and hosted Prime Minister and Mrs. Harold Holt of Australia.  Reconstruction and Improvements  President Richard Nixon used Camp David as much as his five predecessors combined. Nixon had several new buildings built in compatible architectural styles, but complete with modern conveniences. He held cabinet meetings, staff conferences, hosted foreign dignitaries, and family get togethers at Camp David.  President Gerald Ford rode around Camp David on a snowmobile, and hosted President and Mrs. Suharto of Indonesia.  President Jimmy Carter hosted the now famous Camp David Summit in 1978, between Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and resulted in what are now known as the Camp David Accords establishing peace between Egypt and Israel.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000.

I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces.

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567.

Considering flavor, the wrapper combines earthy and spicy aromas with herbaceous pre-draw. When light it presents the palate with woody and earthy flavors. The second third of the smoke reveals the taste of cocoa and spice interspersed with subtle chili-like flavors. The after-taste following the last third is unusually sweet combining it with mushroom flavors. This is one of the tastiest cigars you can ever smoke.  History  Hoyo de Monterrey brand has a long history on the international market of Cuban cigars. Everything is dating since back in 1865 when Don Jose Gener y Batet established this marque of Cuban cigars after he purchased one of the most qualitative plantations of tobacco from the famous region of Cuba, Vuelta Abajo. In time, the brand imposed itself on the market, but with a higher success on the British one. There are only a few brands of Cuban cigars that can be proud of their success. The huge success of this brand was not solely because of the high quality tobacco from Vuelta Abajo, but also due to the wide variety of flavours which can be found in each line of this brand. One of the most appreciated lines created by this brand is considered to be Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure Especial. This line earned a fantastic popularity among all levels of Cuban cigars smokers.  Searching for the finest line of cigars created under the name of Hoyo de Monterrey can be a difficult task as they all are excellent. However, the line Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure Especial is distinguishing itself by others through the immense quantity of flavours, the imposing size of the cigar and with their spectacular appearance. One of these cigars is measuring 141 mm, it has a ring gauge of 50 and all of them are handmade following the format of Robusto Extra. These cigars are easy to discover on the market as there are many smokers that will love to have some of them in their stock. The cigar looks amazing. It has a brown and oily wrapper that is liberating a strong perfume around it making the one who holds it to resist extremely difficult to the desire of igniting it. Also, on the cigar you will not notice prominent veins, but only a few of them that are very thin. The construction of the cigar is perfect. The cigar is solid built, with no soft spots that can make you have a difficult time while smoking it.

Alba Longa  Alba Longa (occasionally written Albalonga in Italian sources) was an ancient city of Latium in central Italy, 12 mi southeast of Rome, in the Alban Hills.  Founder and head of the Latin League, it was destroyed by Rome around the middle of the 7th century BC.  In legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, had come from the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, which in Virgil's Aeneid had been the bloodline of Aeneas, a son of Venus. | Question: In relation to Rome, where was the city whose king was the father of Ocnus?", ['12 mi southeast of Rome'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-1244'), ("Context: Queen Anne - British Royal Family HistoryQueen Anne | Britroyals  Born: February 6, 1665 at  St. James Palace, London  Parents: James II and Anne Hyde  Relation to Elizabeth II: 2nd cousin 8 times removed  House of: Stuart  Ascended to the throne: March 8, 1702 aged 37 years  Crowned: April 23, 1702 at  Westminster Abbey  Married: George, son of Frederick III of Denmark  Children: Eighteen, including miscarriages and still-born, of whom only one William survived to age of 11  Died: August 1, 1714 at  Kensington Palace , aged 49 years, 5 months,  and 22 days  Buried at: Westminster  Reigned for: 12 years, 4 months,  and 24 days  Succeeded by: her 3rd cousin George of Hanover  Anne was the second daughter of James, Duke of York, who became James II, and his first wife, Anne Hyde, daughter of Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.

Only one pane of 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in all philately. A single Inverted Jenny was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in November 2007 for $977,500. In December 2007 a mint never hinged example was sold for $825,000. The broker of the sale said the buyer was a Wall Street executive who had lost the auction the previous month.  A block of four inverted Jennys was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in October 2005 for $2.7 million.  In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, prices fetched by Inverted Jennys have receded. Between January and September 2014, five examples offered at auction sold for sums ranging from $126,000 through $575,100.  Prices seem since to have recovered, for on May 31, 2016, a particularly well-centered Jenny invert, graded XF-superb 95 by Professional Stamp Experts, was sold for at a Siegel Auction for a hammer price of $1,175,000   The addition of a 15% buyer’s premium raised the total record high price paid for this copy to $1,351,250.  Background  During the 1910s, the United States Post Office had made a number of experimental trials of carrying mail by air. These were shown by the first stamp in the world to picture an airplane (captioned as "aeroplane carrying mail"), one of the U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 1912–13.  The Post Office finally decided to inaugurate regular service on May 15, 1918, flying between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The Post Office set a controversial rate of 24 cents for the service, much higher than the 3 cents for first-class mail of the time, and decided to issue a new stamp just for this rate, patriotically printed in red and blue, and depicting a Curtiss Jenny JN-4HM, the biplane especially modified for shuttling the mail. The stamp\'s designer, Clair Aubrey Houston, apparently troubled to procure a photograph of that modified model (produced by removing the second pilot seat from the JN-4HT to create space for mailbags, and by increasing the fuel capacity). As only six such aircraft existed, there was a 1-in-6 chance that the very plane engraved on the stamp by Marcus Baldwin—Jenny #38262—would be chosen to launch the inaugural three-city airmail run; the plane on the stamp was indeed the first to depart on May 15th, taking off from Washington at 11:47 A. M.   The job of designing and printing the new stamp was carried out in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.  Many collectors long thought the blue plane portion was printed first, thus it was actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first and it is the planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, it can be seen that the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames.

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. | Question: Who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', ['fox talbot', 'henry fox talbot'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6913'), ('Context: BBC ON THIS DAY | 11 | 1982: Krays let out for mother\'s ...BBC ON THIS DAY | 11 | 1982: Krays let out for mother\'s funeral  About This Site | Text Only  1982: Krays let out for mother\'s funeral  The notorious East End gangsters Ronnie and Reggie Kray have been allowed out of prison for their mother\'s funeral.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

See More  Solitaire (Jane Seymour) - James Bond Wiki - WikiaSolitaire (Jane Seymour) | James Bond Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Solitaire is a fictional character in the James Bond novel and film Live and Let Die . In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it. After Bond kills Tee Hee, he rescues her out of the bed and they soon make out.

This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result.

Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent.

The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva. This step was taken to avoid development of resistance and compromise the | Question: Artemisinin and derivatives are drugs found to act especially well on which disease?', ['falciparum malaria', 'malaria'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3595'), ("Context: Blood Type Facts - BloodBook, Information on Blood Type ...Blood Type Facts - BloodBook, Information on Blood Type Facts for Life  CLOSE WINDOW \xa0\xa0  Blood types, and   the need for a Blood classification system, were      first called for shortly after Blood transfusions were first     attempted around 1600 by transfusing animal Blood into humans.

In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains. One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores. | Question: What promoted the growrth of Mnemiposis in the Black Sea?', ['long-term environmental changes', 'over-fishing and long-term environmental changes'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4318'), ('Context: Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution.

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel\'s periodical, the Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation. The deluxe illustrated edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871, included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou.  The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne\'s greatest works, along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth. The description of Nemo\'s ship, called the Nautilus, was considered ahead of its time, as it accurately describes features on submarines, which at the time were very primitive vessels. Thus, the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories, unlike some of Verne\'s other works, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels.  Title  The title refers to the distance traveled while under the sea and not to a depth, as 20,000 leagues is over six times the diameter, and nearly three times the circumference of the Earth.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence.

Coming after an attempt on the life of the Fascist leader, Cosgrave wrote:  On behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, I have the honour to congratulate Your Excellency, and the Italian people, on the providential escape of Your Excellency from the odious attempt on your person. Sincerely hoping that the wound is not serious, I send you my most earnest wishes for your speedy recover. The infamous attempt has caused much indignation here.  For Cosgrave, it was particularly important that the Free State send its best wishes, as it was an Irish assailant who made the attempt on Mussolini’s life. Ninety years ago this Thursday, Dublin born woman Violet Gibson fired a revolver shot in Rome that could have changed the course of human history. The story is well known today, and has been the subject of a book and an excellent RTE Radio documentary . This post is \xa0primarily concerned only with how the event was reported at home.  The shooting of Mussolini in front of an adoring crowd was a dramatic event, and that drama was captured in contemporary press reports. The Irish Times reported that  The Italian Prime Minister, after opening the International Surgical Congress in the Capitol of Rome, was passing through a cheering crowd in the square to his motor care, when “an elderly woman in dark clothes” (afterwards identified as the Hon. Violet Gibson) dashed out and fired a small revolver almost point-blank in his face….  Signor Mussolini remained self-composed, reassured his entourage, and while pressing a handkerchief to the wound, gave orders that no reprisals were to be carried out against his assailant, who had been arrested. She was protected by police from the fury of the crowd, who tried to lynch her. She was carried to the police station by police and carabineers.  The shot Gibson fired grazed the nose of Mussolini, and while the press here condemned the “wicked and unprovoked attack”, in truth she did little damage to Mussolini beyond \xa0his requiring a bandaged nose for a number of days.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R. Mead, an associate of Jesse Chisholm in the early-day trading business.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan. There are multiple theories, however, and we go over some of them in our FAQ on the topic:  Why are mulligans called that?

The girl, just turned six, is improving her counting by determinedly calling out the number of each step.  ‘Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-NINE!’ she says in triumph as they step off onto the sand.  Thus Alice Buchan gave the title to her father’s, my grandfather’s, new novel, little knowing that it would prove to be one of the most enduring adventure stories ever to be published.  John Buchan wrote The 39 Steps in a few weeks towards the end of 1914, while staying with his wife and children at Broadstairs in Kent, in a house on the cliffs overlooking Stone Bay. (The house is still there; indeed, anyone wishing to re-enact the novel’s finale may rent it as a holiday let.)  While there, he became ill with the duodenal problems that plagued him all his life, and which had prevented him from joining the Army, Britain having declared war against Germany on August 4 that year. Two major elements among these facts – the clifftop setting and the coming of war – infuse what has come to be widely regarded as the first modern spy thriller.  Buchan posted the manuscript to Blackwood & Sons in Edinburgh, publisher not only of books but of the famous literary magazine that bore its name.  ‘It has amused me to write, but whether it will amuse you to read is another matter,’ he wrote.  He need not have fretted. Blackwood’s accepted it at once and published it in the magazine, in serial form and pseudonymously, between July and September 1915, and as a book under Buchan’s name in October. It was an immediate success – and more than that, it has become a classic of its kind.  Today, the principal charges levelled against the novel are that it is dated, and that it relies too heavily upon improbable circumstances or coincidences. Yet I would argue that even now, almost 100 years after it was first published, the story retains a modernity that is little short of astonishing.  Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, released in 1935, is an extremely well-made comedy thriller that's widely and deservedly admired  I am reminded of its place in our collective narrative by a cartoon I clipped from a newspaper a few years ago and pinned to my office wall. It shows a boy of about eight, standing in front of his parents.  He is wearing a tweed Norfolk jacket, a tie, breeches, chequered shooting stockings and what are no doubt stout brogues. Eyes closed as in serious thought, he is drawing on a pipe clamped between his teeth, the bowl of which he’s holding in his left hand. In his right, half wedged beneath his arm, he holds a copy of The 39 Steps. Anxiously, his mother is saying to her husband, ‘Why doesn’t he read Harry Potter, like other kids?’ Why indeed?  True, The 39 Steps isn’t read by the young (or old) in anything like the numbers that JK Rowling’s marvellous creation attracts, but it’s still in print nearly 100 years after its first publication; indeed, it has never been out of print, something that isn’t true of the works of, for instance, Jane Austen.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.

From Everybody:  "The Little Family Just Got Bigger."  Plot:  Eleanor Little (Geena Davis) and Frederick Little (Hugh Laurie) and their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) are intending an adoption. While George is at school, his parents go to an orphanage where they meet and fall in love with a humanoid mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Despite misgivings from Mrs. Keeper (Julia Sweeney), they adopt Stuart and take him home. However, Stuart is greeted coldly by George, who refuses to acknowledge the mouse as his brother, and the family cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane), who is disgusted at having a mouse for a "master". Despite Eleanor and Frederick\'s intentions, Stuart quickly feels like an outsider in the large Little family, especially when the family\'s unknowing relatives bring Stuart large presents and George snaps at his family, claiming out loud that Stuart is not his brother. When Stuart admits his feelings of loneliness to his parents, they ask Mrs. Keeper to do some background research on Stuart\'s biological family.After accidentally stumbling across George\'s playroom in the basement, Stuart finally bonds with George when they play together and plan to finish George\'s remote controlled boat, the Wasp, for an upcoming boat race in Central Park. At the same time, however, one of Snowbell\'s alley cat friends, Monty (voiced by Steve Zahn) visits unexpectedly and discovers Stuart. Determined not to have his reputation destroyed, Snowbell meets with Monty\'s leader, Smokey (voiced by Chazz Palminteri), a mafia don-like alley cat, and plans to have Stuart removed from the household without harming him.Stuart and George finish the Wasp in time for the race, but on the day of the race, the control is smashed when a bystander accidentally steps on it. Stuart pilots the Wasp himself, but ends up in a tussle with a larger boat belonging to George\'s rival, Anton, who has already smashed the rest of the boats without being disqualified. Stuart snaps the wires of Anton\'s boat and manages to win the race, at the same time finally winning George\'s acceptance and respect. During the family celebration, however, the Little\'s are visited by a mouse couple, Reginald and Camille Stout (voiced by Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly), who claim to be Stuart\'s parents who gave him up to the orphanage years ago due to poverty. Reluctantly, Stuart leaves with the Stouts, George presenting him with his toy car as a farewell gift. A few days later, however, Mrs. Keeper comes to visit and tells the Little\'s that Stuart\'s parents actually died many years ago in a supermarket accident. Realizing their son has been kidnapped, the Little\'s call the police and stick posters of Stuart\'s face across the city.Meanwhile, Snowbell meets with Smokey and the alley cats: he had actually conspired with them to have the Stouts pose as Stuart\'s parents in order to remove Stuart from the household. Fearing retribution should the Little\'s discover Snowbell\'s deception, Smokey orders the Stouts to hand Stuart over to them, but the Stouts, having grown to truly love Stuart, tell him to flee. Smokey subsequently orders a manhunt for Stuart. They corner him in Central Park and a chase ensues. Despite losing his car and almost falling down a storm drain, Stuart manages to evade Smokey and return home, unfortunately, while the Little\'s are out putting posters up. The only one present is Snowbell, who lies that the Little\'s have been enjoying themselves greatly since Stuart\'s departure, and uses Stuart\'s removed face from the family photograph as proof (which they had actually used for the posters).

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000. Westwood has performed particularly well in European Tour events, having won a total of 18 tournaments, and in 2000 he achieved the European Tour Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s seven year run of victory.

The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect\'s talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators\' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968. In 1975 Smallfilms were given back the rights to the stories and began remaking the second | Question: In the children’s television series ‘Ivor the Engine’ what is the name of the dragon?', ['idris'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-893'), ('Context: Electrical Conductivity and Resistivity - nde-ed.orgElectrical Properties  Electrical Conductivity and Resistivity  It is well known that one of the subatomic particles of an atom is the electron. The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. At any moment in time many individual lattice atoms will be away from their perfect lattice sites and this interferes with electron movement.  When the temperature coefficient is known, an adjusted resistivity value can be computed using the following formula:  R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1–T2)]  Where: R1 = resistivity value adjusted | Question: What electrical property, the reciprocal of resistivity, has the SI units Siemens per metre?', ['conductivity'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4196')]

With its legendary casino and countless rows of millionaires' yachts in the harbour, Monaco is a glamorous place that lies at the very heart of the jet-set. It is also unique in that for many of the drivers the race is run on their doorstep, with the same streets they use for a daily trip to the newsagents, transformed into a race track.  Winding through the streets it is a circuit that has remained remarkably unchanged since the first race was staged in 1929. Before the war the circuit was witness to several great battles, with the legendary Tazio Nuvolari often among the winners. When World Championship racing began in 1950 Monaco played host to the second race, just a week after the first round at Silverstone. That race resulted in a massive pile-up on the very first lap and provided Fangio with his first ever championship victory. Since then the race has been plagued by a high attrition rate that has thrown up some unusual victories over the years. The combination of narrow roads, high kerbs and the close proximity of some unforgiving crash barriers, many a great driver has suffered at the hands of a track that quickly punishes the slightest error in judgement.  One memorable race came in 1955, the year that is best remembered for Alberto Ascari's trip into the harbour, a feat that was later emulated by the Australian driver Paul Hawkins. Both men survived their dunking although a number of driver's have not been so lucky. Luigi Fagioli was killed in a sports car race here in 1952 and Lorenzo Bandini was burned to death in 1967.

Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient\'s duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP\'s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don\'t deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Presidents have entertained visiting heads of state, such a former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , conducted cabinet meetings, and briefed Congressional leaders at the retreat. The 1978 Middle East peace talks concluded with what have become known as the Camp David Accords. Yet few Americans know much about the place, considering its prominence.  Federal Summer Camp  It all started in 1935, when the Work Projects Administration , WPA, began building the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area Project near Thurmont, Maryland, as an example of creating parks from worn-out agricultural land.  Three years later, the area opened as a camp for federal government employees and their families. Known as Hi-Catoctin, the facility consisted of several small cabins, a dining hall, and a swimming pool. Covered with trees and 1,800 feet above sea level, the spot provided a cool respite from the near tropical humidity of the Washington, DC, area.  Meanwhile, immediately after America's entry into World War II, doctors for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt were urging the ailing president to find a place convenient to Washington, yet far enough away to escape the heat and political pressures of the city.  The presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was out of the question because of heightened security considerations imposed by the war. After a search committee considered two other sites on Furnace Mountain on the Virginia side of the Potomac River below Harper's Ferry; and Shenandoah National Park, Virginia; Roosevelt toured two sites in the Catoctin Mountains.  He picked Hi-Catoctin, issuing a set of instructions on how the buildings should be remodeled and asking for the construction of a main lodge, which resembled the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. The initial work cost $25,000. The camp was renamed the USS Shangri La, to follow up on the nautical connection, since many workers involved with the Potomac worked on the camp.  Popular Presidential Choice  Since Roosevelt inaugurated Shangri-La with a three-day visit beginning July 18, 1942, all subsequent presidents have made extensive use of the mountain top retreat.  President Harry Truman did not visit Shangri-La often because Bess, his wife, felt it was dull. However, when they did visit, the Trumans enjoyed Shangri-La. Truman's favorite sport was walking and he spent long hours wandering the mountain trails with a secret service agent in tow.  Renamed Camp David  President Dwight Eisenhower changed the name of the retreat to Camp David in honor of his grandson, David Eisenhower. Although he and his wife, Mamie, tended to use Camp David for private relaxation, Eisenhower held the first cabinet meeting ever to take place there. He also hosted British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David.  President John Kennedy and his family visited the camp often, enjoying the horseback riding and other recreational opportunities. Kennedy also allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use Camp David when he was not there.  President Lyndon Johnson held several important discussions with advisers on the Vietnam War, the crisis in the Dominican Republic, and other world events, at Camp David and hosted Prime Minister and Mrs. Harold Holt of Australia.  Reconstruction and Improvements  President Richard Nixon used Camp David as much as his five predecessors combined. Nixon had several new buildings built in compatible architectural styles, but complete with modern conveniences. He held cabinet meetings, staff conferences, hosted foreign dignitaries, and family get togethers at Camp David.  President Gerald Ford rode around Camp David on a snowmobile, and hosted President and Mrs. Suharto of Indonesia.

Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand. It sits behind a goal, with the family stand to the right, main stand to the left, and the kop directly opposite.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ("Context: Australian islands | australia.gov.auAustralian islands | australia.gov.au  Australian islands  Australian islands  World Heritage-listed Fraser Island. Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

Since then, the plot of the novel has woven its way into popular culture: Captain Ahab and the hunt for the White Whale continue to spark adaptations, reworkings, and allusions, while the opening line, "Call me Ishmael," remains one of the most well-known first words in fiction. However, Ishmael both as narrator and character has been primarily the property of academic rather than popular culture. Particularly following F. O. Matthiessen s classic American Renaissance, published in 1941 in the midst of the Nazi aggression, Ishmael has been appropriated by critics intent upon finding in him the figure of resistance to totalitarianism and fulfillment of democratic freedom. Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity. But the Holocaust (the Shoah) effectively marks the final collapse of traditional Western humanism. Jewish thinkers such as George Steiner and Emmanuel Levinas have been reassessing this collapse and its consequences. Both suggest alternative Jewish humanisms that reread Western culture and literature through a "Holocaust hermeneutics" that ethicizes and morally impassions the act of reading, studying, and responding to texts, and that elevates the role of the textual and human Other to one of primacy and priority. Rereading Moby-Dick under Steinerian and Levinasian norms reveals an Ishmael whose dealings with the Other pose troubling ethical questions in a post-Shoah world, and challenges the traditional "Cold War consensus" that makes of Ishmael the American emblem of Western freedom and humanitarianism  Subject  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEAHey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEA  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe?

Logan Smalley and Stephanie Kent were at a bar one evening in New York when the conversation turned to books, and specifically, to first sentences of novels. In any such conversation, three words in particular are invariably mentioned: “Call me Ishmael,” the iconic opening of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. What came next was a question that in hindsight, seems unthinkable no one had ever asked before: What if you really could call Ishmael? “We quickly realized that it was a pun worth keeping,” Smalley said.  Smalley and Kent set to work creating Call Me Ishmael , a platform for people to tell personal stories about books they love, with the hopes of connecting people with their next great read. They set up a cell phone number for Ishmael, which goes straight to voice mail and prompts people to anonymously leave a message about “a book you’ve loved and a story you’ve lived.” A few\xa0times a week, Smalley transcribes a message by typewriter, filming the text as it scrolls up the typewriter carriage in time to the audio.  Although Smalley is no literary luddite—he and Kent both read and e-read—he said this particular project called for something more tangible than is typical in our digital age. “[People] want to call a complete stranger and tell them the really profound and potentially really personal story about how a book has affected them,” said Smalley. “That exchange, to us, necessitates something that feels very handmade and safe and comfortable, and gets a legitimate treatment.

Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time.  During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north.  Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp.  Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced.  Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints.  Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life.  Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles.  Last time I checked, a painting of Rubens, 'Massacre of the Innocents', still holds the record as the most expensive painting by an old master, sold at auction (Sotheby's, 49.5 million Pounds).

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."

Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone. This scene brings their difficult relationship to a close.

Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process. The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products. Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston). | Question: Of what were materials that left little residue thought to contain?', ['phlogiston'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3490'), ('Context: An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient\'s duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP\'s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don\'t deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, "I plead for the beauty that surrounds us"; this is known as a "creative plea," and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty. | Question: What third type of plea uses creative words?', ['no contest', 'creative plea'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6915')]

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

The members of the order strive to cultivate the ideals of the order’s founder. The Franciscans actually consist of three orders. The First Order comprises priests and lay brothers who have sworn to lead a life of prayer, preaching, and penance. This First Order is divided into three independent branches: the Friars Minor (O.F.M.), the Friars Minor Conventual (O.F.M. Conv.), and the Friars Minor Capuchin (O.F.M. Cap.). The Second Order consists of cloistered nuns who belong to the Order of St. Clare (O.S.C.) and are known as Poor Clares (P.C.). The Third Order consists of religious and lay men and women who try to emulate Saint Francis’ spirit by performing works of teaching, charity, and social service. Strictly speaking, the latter order consists of the Third Order Secular , whose lay members live in the world without vows; and the Third Order Regular, whose members live in religious communities under vow. Congregations of these religious men and women are numerous all over the Roman Catholic world. The Franciscans are the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic church. They have contributed six popes to the church.  It was probably in 1207 that Francis felt the call to a life of preaching, penance, and total poverty. He was soon joined by his first followers, to whom he gave a short and simple rule of life. In 1209 he and 11 of his followers journeyed to Rome, where Francis received approval of his rule from Pope Innocent III . Under this rule, Franciscan friars could own no possessions of any kind, either individually or communally (i.e., as the property of the order as a whole). The friars wandered and preached among the people, helping the poor and the sick. They supported themselves by working and by begging food, but they were forbidden to accept money either as payment for work or as alms. The Franciscans worked at first in Umbria and then in the rest of Italy and abroad. The impact of these street preachers and especially of their founder was immense, so that within 10 years they numbered 5,000. Affiliated with them were the Franciscan nuns, whose order was founded at Assisi in 1212, by St. Clare , who was under the guidance of St. Francis. Clare and her followers were lodged by Francis in the Church of San Damiano, where they lived a severe life of total poverty. They later became known as the Poor Clares or the Order of St. Clare.  Similar Topics  Cistercian  During the first years of the Franciscans, the example of Francis provided their real rule of life, but, as the order grew, it became clear that a revised rule was necessary. After preparing a rule in 1221 that was found too strict, Francis, with the help of several legal scholars, unwillingly composed the more restrained final rule in 1223. This rule was approved by Pope Honorius III .  Even before the death of Francis in 1226, conflicts had developed within the order over the observance of the vow of complete poverty . The rapid expansion of the order’s membership had created a need for settled monastic houses, but it was impossible to justify these if Francis’ rule of complete poverty was followed strictly. Three parties gradually appeared: the Zealots , who insisted on a literal observance of the primitive rule of poverty affecting communal as well as personal poverty; the Laxists, who favoured many mitigations; and the Moderates, or the Community , who wanted a legal structure that would permit some form of communal possessions. Something of an equilibrium was reached between these different schools of thought while St. Bonaventure was minister general (1257–74). Sometimes called the second founder of the order, he provided a wise, moderate interpretation of the rule. During this period the friars spread throughout Europe, while missionaries penetrated Syria and Africa.

The girl, just turned six, is improving her counting by determinedly calling out the number of each step.  ‘Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-NINE!’ she says in triumph as they step off onto the sand.  Thus Alice Buchan gave the title to her father’s, my grandfather’s, new novel, little knowing that it would prove to be one of the most enduring adventure stories ever to be published.  John Buchan wrote The 39 Steps in a few weeks towards the end of 1914, while staying with his wife and children at Broadstairs in Kent, in a house on the cliffs overlooking Stone Bay. (The house is still there; indeed, anyone wishing to re-enact the novel’s finale may rent it as a holiday let.)  While there, he became ill with the duodenal problems that plagued him all his life, and which had prevented him from joining the Army, Britain having declared war against Germany on August 4 that year. Two major elements among these facts – the clifftop setting and the coming of war – infuse what has come to be widely regarded as the first modern spy thriller.  Buchan posted the manuscript to Blackwood & Sons in Edinburgh, publisher not only of books but of the famous literary magazine that bore its name.  ‘It has amused me to write, but whether it will amuse you to read is another matter,’ he wrote.  He need not have fretted. Blackwood’s accepted it at once and published it in the magazine, in serial form and pseudonymously, between July and September 1915, and as a book under Buchan’s name in October. It was an immediate success – and more than that, it has become a classic of its kind.  Today, the principal charges levelled against the novel are that it is dated, and that it relies too heavily upon improbable circumstances or coincidences. Yet I would argue that even now, almost 100 years after it was first published, the story retains a modernity that is little short of astonishing.  Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, released in 1935, is an extremely well-made comedy thriller that's widely and deservedly admired  I am reminded of its place in our collective narrative by a cartoon I clipped from a newspaper a few years ago and pinned to my office wall. It shows a boy of about eight, standing in front of his parents.  He is wearing a tweed Norfolk jacket, a tie, breeches, chequered shooting stockings and what are no doubt stout brogues. Eyes closed as in serious thought, he is drawing on a pipe clamped between his teeth, the bowl of which he’s holding in his left hand. In his right, half wedged beneath his arm, he holds a copy of The 39 Steps. Anxiously, his mother is saying to her husband, ‘Why doesn’t he read Harry Potter, like other kids?’ Why indeed?  True, The 39 Steps isn’t read by the young (or old) in anything like the numbers that JK Rowling’s marvellous creation attracts, but it’s still in print nearly 100 years after its first publication; indeed, it has never been out of print, something that isn’t true of the works of, for instance, Jane Austen.

In legend, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, had come from the royal dynasty of Alba Longa, which in Virgil's Aeneid had been the bloodline of Aeneas, a son of Venus. | Question: In relation to Rome, where was the city whose king was the father of Ocnus?", ['12 mi southeast of Rome'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-1244'), ('Context: Volkswagen BeetleThe Volkswagen Beetle (officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in Germany the Volkswagen Käfer and in the U.S. as Volkswagen Bug) is a two-door, four passenger, rear-engine economy car manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003.  The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen.

The 2012 Summer Olympics included 26 sports, with two additional sports due to be added to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports.  The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF).  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of Aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation),  or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of Skating, represented by the International Skating Union).  In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport\'s prevalence. The IOC\'s requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well—more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and Summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).  Previous Olympic Games included sports which are no longer present on the current program, like polo and tug of war.  These sports, known as "discontinued sports", were later removed either because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body. Archery and tennis are examples of sports that were competed at the early Games and were later dropped by the IOC, but managed to return to the Olympic program (in 1972 and 1988, respectively). Demonstration sports have often been included in the Olympic Games, usually to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport.  Some such sports, like baseball and curling, were added to the official Olympic program (in 1992 and 1998, respectively). Baseball, however, was discontinued after the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Olympic sports definitions  The term "sport" in Olympic terminology refers to all the events that are sanctioned by one international sport federation, a definition that may be different from the common meaning of the word sport. One sport, by Olympic definition, may be divided into several disciplines, which are often regarded as separate sports in common language.  For example: Aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines: Swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and high diving (the last of which is a non-Olympic discipline), since all these disciplines are governed at international level by the International Swimming Federation. Skating is a winter Olympic sport represented by the International Skating Union, and includes four disciplines: figure skating, speed skating (on a traditional long track), short track speed skating and synchronized skating (the latter is a non-Olympic discipline). The sport with the largest number of Olympic disciplines is skiing, with six: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, nordic combined, snowboarding and freestyle skiing.  Other notable multi-discipline sports are gymnastics (artistic, rhythmic and trampoline), cycling (road, track, mountain and BMX), volleyball (indoors and beach), wrestling (freestyle and Greco-Roman), canoeing (flatwater and slalom) and bobsleigh (includes skeleton). The disciplines listed here are only those contested in the Olympics—gymnastics has two non-Olympic disciplines, while cycling and wrestling have three each.  It should also be noted that the IOC definition of a "discipline" may differ from that used by an international federation. For example, the IOC considers artistic gymnastics a single discipline, but the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG) classifies men\'s and women\'s artistic gymnastics as separate disciplines.  Similarly, the IOC considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline, but United World Wrestling uses "freestyle wrestling | Question: Summer Olympic sports are divided into categories based on popularity and the potential in generating revenue.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

The medal is silver; one side has the effigy of the reigning British monarch, and the other side has St. George and the dragon with the inscription “The George Medal.”  Learn More in these related articles:  World War 2 Awards.com - George CrossWorld War 2 Awards.com - George Cross  George Cross  Number of awards in the database: 139  Total awarded for WW II:    139  Recipients A-Z  The George Cross -or GC- was instituted June 24th, 1941, by King George VI. This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously. Three women were awarded the GC for resistance activities in occupied  territories during WW 2. One of them was Noor Inayat Khan. This Russian born woman was dropped over France July 16th, 1943, to assist the French resistance movement in their activities.

Traditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and HullsTraditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and Hulls  Caulking Decks and Hulls  Introduction  Caulking is defined by driving oakum, cotton or general rope fibres in the seams of a ship's wooden deck or side / hull to make it watertight. It also plays a structural role in tightening up the hull / deck of a ship and reduces the longitudinal movement of neighbouring planks.  It is very easy to demonstrate the principles behind caulking a vessel, however, it is a skill where practice is\xa0 important but also individual vessels present their own issues. Usually you will have to warm to the task, understand which iron you\xa0 have to use, and how much oakum. There is a lot in the skill that simply comes from experience and new builds present different\xa0 issues to old boats.  The final pitching of the seam was not demonstrated because it was not occurring at the time of the\xa0 demonstration.  Procedure  The process is demonstrated in the accompanying video clips with a step-by-step guide.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.  There are also some Ganglion cells                            are also observed. Blood from throughout                           the adrenal gland collects into large medullary veins to exit                           the gland.

The Pirates of Penzance – English National OperaThe Pirates of Penzance | Discover Opera | English National Opera  The Pirates of Penzance  Composer  Gilbert & Sullivan  Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera is packed full of sentimental\xa0pirates, blundering policeman, absurd adventures and improbable paradoxes.  Frederic, a pirate’s apprentice, falls head-over-heels in love with Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley. Frederic is due to be released from his apprenticeship on his 21st birthday, but there’s a snag. Born on 29\xa0February, Frederic discovers that he is technically still a youngster. Although very much in love, his dedication to duty is unshakeable. Can he find a way to live happily-ever-after with Mabel?  Synopsis  Act I  A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall  The pirates offer a toast to Frederic who is celebrating his 21st birthday and the end of his apprenticeship. Ruth, a maid who also works with the pirates, explains that when Frederic was younger she was instructed by his father to have the small boy apprenticed to a pilot, but she misheard and instead took Frederic to a pirate.  Now that his obligation to the pirates has ended, duty compels Frederic to devote himself to destroying them. When the men admit their inability to make piracy pay, Frederic explains that they are themselves slaves to their tender hearts, particularly regarding their refusal to take advantage of anyone they believe to be an orphan. Frederic wishes he could bring the pirates back to a respectable life, but the Pirate King rejects that possibility.  Ruth longs for Frederic to take her with him when he leaves. He admits that he is reluctant to marry her, though he is satisfied that, despite her age, she is beautiful. But when he sees a group of lovely young women approaching, he rages at her for deceiving him.  The young women are astonished to encounter Frederic and horrified to hear that he is a pirate. He assures them that he only wants to love one of them. They all reject him except Mabel.  The pirates surprise the girls and anticipate soon becoming their husbands. Their father, the Major General, enters and objects to the girls being married against their wills to pirates. He lies his way out of the situation by claiming to be an orphan. The girls are released from the pirates’ clutches, as Mabel and Frederic – ignoring the pleas of Ruth – look forward to their marriage.

Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: Henry Hall (American revolution)  Captain Henry Hall was an American from Dennis, Massachusetts who fought in the American Revolutionary War, who later was the first to successfully cultivate cranberries.

After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences! That\'s not fair, is it!  This message has been edited. Last edited by: Izzy loves you all ,  Izzy loves you all  \xa0  I don\'t agree that Americans always want to be different from the British.  It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.  Still, if some Americans adopt a British accent, and call the letter Z "zed," and an elevator "a lift," the rest of us kind of smile and think the speaker is a | Question: We call it a ‘full stop’ what do Americans call it?', ['period'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1792'), ('Context: War Chhod Na Yaar  War Chhod Na Yaar (English translation: "Quit the War, Dude") is a 2013 Hindi Indian war comedy film directed and written by Faraz Haider and dialogues are written by Deepak Kingrani.

Dyer - who plays pub landlord Mick Carter on the BBC1 soap - has swapped pint pots for Tube stops, having pre-recorded some messages for unsuspecting travellers as EastEnders celebrates its 30th anniversary.

"So remember everyone - mind that gap”.

He won the Boys Club Boxing Tournament at the age of eight. At 11, he qualified to compete in his first Junior Olympics. By age 16, Evander Holyfield weighed 139 lbs. (a Junior Welterweight) and became the Southeastern Regional Champion, winning this tournament and the Best Boxer Award. In 1989, Holyfield became the WBC Continental Heavyweight Champion by defeating Michael Dokes. In 1990, he fulfilled a 20-year dream, when he became the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World by defeating Buster Douglas, then IBF, WBC and WBA champion. Holyfield remained the undisputed world heavyweight champion until 1992, when he lost to Riddick Bowe. This defeat was short-lived as Evander Holyfield regained his championship title in a rematch with Riddick Bowe in 1993. In 1996, Evander Holyfield joined Muhammad Ali, in the history books as the second man to become the three-time world heavyweight champion. He accomplished this remarkable achievement by defeating Mike Tyson and continued to hold that title after defeating him in a rematch. In 2000, Holyfield defeated the WBA number one contender John “the Quiet Man” Ruiz and became the only man to win a share of the WBA Heavyweight Championship on four different occasions.  When he was 19 years old, Holyfield represented the U.S. in the Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, where he won a silver medal. The following year, he was the National Golden Gloves Champion, and won a bronze medal representing the U.S. in the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles.  Holyfield made his professional debut in November, 1984 defeating Lionel Bryams. He won his first Cruiserweight title in 1986 against Dwight M. Qwai (then WBA Junior Heavyweight), and became the first boxer of the 1984 Olympic Games to win a championship title.  Over the next three years, Holyfield earned his place in the history books, by becoming the only boxer ever to become an undefeated, undisputed Cruiserweight Champion. Even today, all Cruiserweight championship belts bear his likeness as a lasting tribute to his legacy.  Carrying his championship drive to all facets of life, Evander Holyfield has created the Holyfield Foundation, a not-for-profit organization whose focus is on the family. The charity’s primary objective is to provide a supportive, safe environment for inner city youth to grow spiritually, educationally and athletically.

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.  Postcards from Paradise is officially out on March 31. For more on Ringo visit ringostarr.com .

J Retail Leisure Property (2007) 6: 327. doi:10.1057/palgrave.rlp.5100074  94 Downloads  Abstract  This paper explores the use of maritime heritage tourism as a tool for regenerating the post-industrial city of Dundee in relation to its history and to present efforts of re-imaging. Although Dundee has historically benefited from its proximity to the River Tay, since its demise as a port, regeneration strategies so far embraced have tended to focus on the centre, and in particular the development of retail and latterly, the city's new ‘cultural quarter’. A new phase in urban renewal has brought about increased interest in the waterfront area which seeks to extend the existing focal point further east down the riverside beyond that of the Discovery Point Heritage Centre which showcases Captain Scott's ship ‘The Discovery’ as Dundee's main maritime visitor attraction and a key part of the city's former brand campaign as ‘City of Discovery’. The city has opted for a multifaceted strategy of development that includes a broader focus on leisure rather than solely heritage tourism per se, perhaps in recognition of the city's inability to establish a buoyant tourism base. Drawing upon original qualitative research, the paper critiques the approach being adopted and analyses the relationship between maritime heritage and a broader emphasis on leisure development. It assesses whether this is likely to promote a sustainable initiative of urban vibrancy and renewal rather than the present reality of a former industrial city in decline.  Keywords  INTRODUCTION 1  ‘Certain elements in the Scottish past have suffered particular violence … some aspects are particularly distorted, while others, which should be prominent, hardly figure at all.’ 2  Dundee suffered from continuous economic decline in the latter decades of the 20th century. The last jute factories traditionally associated with the city had by then closed down along with other related industries. In the late 1980s and 1990s, policy makers in Dundee adopted various strategies to promote the city. For example, they began investing in the three ‘T's of teaching, tourism and technology, due to the decline in importance of the formerly dominant three ‘J's of jute, jam and journalism for which the city had become famous. The ‘Dundee Project’, first launched in 1981 was aimed at saving the city from cumulative social and economic decline by fundamentally changing its image. This strategy looked to Dundee's past, but in so doing embraced the city's maritime rather than its industrial heritage as a base upon which to build its regeneration. The ‘Dundee Project’ in 1991 evolved into the ‘Dundee Partnership’, a joint initiative responsible for city and community planning among the key agencies of the Dundee City Council, Scottish Enterprise Tayside, Tayside Police and NHS Tayside. This was followed by a promotional campaign for the city that was to brand it as the ‘City of Discovery’. This brand name was derived from Captain's Scott's ship, the ‘Discovery’, which was built in Dundee. The ‘Discovery’ was berthed in 1993 on Discovery Quay beside the purpose-built Discovery Point museum and heritage centre. This is now Dundee's main maritime visitor attraction and a key part of the city's former brand campaign as ‘City of Discovery’. The attraction focuses on Dundee's 19th century shipbuilding past. It shows visitors also how the city became a major centre for whaling and furthermore had a large merchant fleet that was later to keep the town's industries supplied with raw materials. 3  In 1993, at the same time as the ‘Discovery’ was being berthed, a bitter dispute was being enacted that was to lead to the final closure in Dundee of Timex, a multinational watch manufacturer with | Question: Which UK city is traditionally associated with jute, jam and journalism?", ['dundee'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5036'), ('Context: What\'s Up (TV series)  What\'s Up () is a 2011 South Korean television series starring Lim Ju-hwan, Daesung, Lim Ju-eun, Oh Man-seok, Jang Hee-jin, Lee Soo-hyuk, Kim Ji-won and Jo Jung-suk.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

The location(s) of the Adrenal Glands:  The human body normally* includes two adrenal glands.  They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected.

Reg's mother decided that his future was in show business, and Reg wanted this too, so gave up his day jobs to pursue an entertainment career. Reg entertained troops during World War 2 and worked on stage with Benny Hill on being demobilised. In 1961 Reg got his big break by being cast in 'The Rag Trade', before starring in a solo-show called 'The Seven Faces of Reg Varney' in which he frantically had to change costumes for seven characters and perform each in front of a live audience. Reg suffered his first heart attack in 1965. In 1966 Reg starred in the classic 'St Trinian's Great Train Robbery' and 'Beggar My neighbour', running until 1967. Reg had become a national treasure and famously opened and used the very first ever ATM Cash machine in June 1967. In 1969 he starred in 'Rose and Crown'.

The series spanned 73 episodes, with Reg leaving part-way through the final seventh series having made history with co-stars Bob Grant, Stephen Lewis, Doris Hare, Michael Robbins and Anna Karen. Reg suffered a second, this time major, heart attack in 1981. In 1988 at the age of 72 Reg travelled to Australia where he played Stan in a stage version of 'On the Buses', and in 1990 the entire original cast appeared on the interview series 'Wogan', where Reg announced that a new series called 'Back on the Buses' was in the pipeline. Unfortunately this new series was never made. Reg's health had begun to fail him in the early 1990s and was forced to retire, living alone in Devon with his wife Lilian, who died in 2002 after 63 years of marriage.

He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, claiming 2,748 victories from 8,064 starts. He won a total of 21 classic races, including Epson Derby five times. He committed suicide at the age of 29 after the loss of his wife during childbirth.

Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith. "That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law," he wrote. "Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ." Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was "as though I had been born again."

May 7th 2016  Nearly everyone has some kind of fear, and some fears are more common than others. Sometimes these fears are rooted in actual experiences and other times they are not. Even having multiple phobias is quite common. These are just some of the most common phobias, but there are much more that have been documented.  1. Arachnophobia  Arachnophobia is the fear of spiders. Many people who share this fear are typically affected by a childhood memory, or are just frightened by the appearance. Even the thought of one crawling on their skin can make them shudder in fear. In the dark ages, spiders were thought to harbor the bubonic plague and were seen as a source of food and water contamination, leading to a widespread fear of spiders.  2. Ophidiophobia  Ophidiophobia is a fear of snakes. Some experts believe that the fear of snakes may be an innate survival mechanism to protect people from poisonous reptiles, though others argue that if this was the case, this phobia wouldn\'t be as common as it is. This phobia can cause people to avoid places like zoos or pet stores.  3. Acrophobia  Acrophobia is a fear of heights. Unlike a lot of fears, this fear can manifest into other fears, such as a fear of flying or roller coasters. This fear can vary in severity as well. Some may avoid things like climbing ladders, while others may not be able to ride in an elevator or go to a high floor in a building.  4. Necrophobia  Necrophobia is the fear of death or dead things. This is a very common fear, especially after the loss of a loved one. This fear is a sort of defense mechanism of the mind. This can also be a very difficult phobia to overcome because of the uncertainty surrounding death and the large faith component associated with death and dying.  5. Cynophobia  Cynophobia is the fear of dogs, and is often the result of a traumatic experience. For example, someone bitten by a dog as an infant may have a fear of dogs into adulthood without knowing why. This phobia can cause people to avoid dog-owning friends or relatives.  6. Claustrophobia  Most people know that claustrophobia is the fear of confined spaces. This fear can manifest after a traumatic experience, such as being stuck in an elevator, though this is not always the case. Claustrophobia can vary in severity and is known to run in families.  7. Coulrophobia  Coulrophobia is the fear of clowns. Many people develop this fear as children, though this isn\'t always the case. Clowns are often portrayed in media as bad, such as in the move "It", or in real life as was the case with serial killer John Wayne Gacy who dressed up like a clown. This can trigger a phobia in some people.  8. Pediophobia  This is the phobia of dolls. Dolls were originally created as vessels for the dead, and this seems to be the root of many fears, particularly that the dolls could cause harm to the person with the phobia. One high profile case of pediophobia is that of Zak Bagans from the television show "Ghost Adventures." Bagans\' phobia is so intense that he cannon touch a doll or toy clown.  9. Hemophobia  This is the fear of blood. Some people experience feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness and occasionally faint at the sight of blood, even when it is something as small as a cut. The origins of this fear are unclear, but it may be related to a fear of death.  10. Glossaphobia  This is one phobia that many people struggle to overcome. Glossaphobia is the fear of public speaking. This phobia can manifest in childhood, and it\'s estimated that up to 75 percent of people have this fear to some degree.  11.

However, it has also been suggested that the prefix "Wall" acknowledges a people who had contact with the Roman empire (see Vlach)."  Damian in Edinburgh \xa0 Tue Nov 06, 2007 9:18 am GMT  ***"The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner,"***  Ironically is indeed the operative word here.   As far as the English, particularly, are concerned, the Welsh people have always been considered more "foreign" than have the other constituent member races of the entire British Isles, including what is now the people of the Republic of Ireland, who, technically, are really foreigners.   Certainly we Scots have not been seen in quite the same light by the English as have the Welsh people as an entity.  I think that several factors are involved in this English perception of the Welsh as being "more foreign" - one being, of course, the survival of the Welsh Language, a Language seen as quite alien to English itself in so many ways.    There are characteristics of Welsh that are more similar to some Continental Languages than there are to English.   Bearing in mind the nature of the Welsh Language, you then have to consider the physical closeness of Wales to the main body of England geographically - ie the Midlands and Southern England generally, the areas most seen as the political powerhouse of England politically and culturally.  Here in Scotland we are considerably further away in distance from much of England (including London and the Home Counties) yet we are not seen as being as "foreign" as the Welsh as we do not have the "advantage" of a separate Language like they have.  Many English people feel a real sense of "difference" when crossing the border out of England and into Wales which they don\'t quite feel when driving out of England into Scotland.   I think that is entirely due to the sudden change from Anglo Saxon place names in England to the "foreign" looking Welsh place names in Wales - not to mention the fact that all road signs immediately become bi-lingual, including road markings ie "Araf" "meaning "Slow" painted on the road surfaces.  Each time I\'ve driven over the English/Welsh border (four times now) I noticed that at first the English word took precedence above the Welsh word, but the further into Wales you go - ie further into the strongholds of the still surviving (and flourishing) Welsh Language the Welsh word takes precedence.  This simply doesn\'t happen when travelling back and forth over the Scottish / English border which I have done countless numbers of times - if I had a quid for each time I\'ve crossed the border I\'d have a bloody good holiday on one of the Greek islands....or take a cruise down the Nile..I\'d love to go and take a peek at the newly resurrected King Tut.

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil\'s people", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "scharfe Barmherzigkeit" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames." Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews\' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these "envenomed worms" would be forced into labour or expelled "for all time". In Robert Michael\'s view, Luther\'s words "We are at fault in not slaying them" amounted to a sanction for murder.

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds. The name “unmodified round brilliant” was applied to a symmetrical round cut with a regular array of 58 facets, cut to modern standards. The system was the culmination of years of research that included the results of preference testing among a wide variety of groups, including trade professionals and consumers.  GIA designed the system to assess the design quality and craftsmanship of diamonds cut in the standard round brilliant style when compared to modern preferences. | Question: A modern round brilliant cut has 58 what?", ['facets'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3808'), ('Context: Tesla was offered the task of completely redesigning the Edison Company\'s direct current generators.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

Mammy Two Shoes (sometimes Mrs. Two Shoes) is a recurring character in MGM \'s Tom and Jerry cartoons. She is a heavy-set middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters.  As a partially seen character , she was famous for never showing her face (except very briefly in Saturday Evening Puss ). Mammy\'s appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. It was later revealed that her character was greatly inspired by Oscar -winning black actress and singer Hattie McDaniel , best known for playing "Mammy" in MGM and David O. Selznick \'s 1939 film Gone with the Wind .  A character very similar to Mammy Two Shoes had earlier been portrayed in the Disney Silly Symphonies shorts Three Orphan Kittens and More Kittens , as well as the Pluto short Pantry Pirate and the Figaro short Figaro and Cleo . A similar character Aunt Petunia the Mammy actually shows her face which resembles blackface in The Little Audrey Cartoon Series .  Contents  7 References  \xa0 Theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoons  \xa0 Mammy Two Shoes, in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , whose full face was shown for the first time.  Mammy first appeared in Puss Gets the Boot , the first Tom and Jerry cartoon (except Tom was called "Jasper"). She always referred to Tom as his given name Thomas and almost always used "is" in conjunction with a pronoun ("is you" and "I is"). The character went on to make many appearances through the entire series until 1952 and her last appearance in the short, Push-Button Kitty . William Hanna and Joseph Barbera initially portrayed Mammy as the maid of the house, with the real owners unknown to us. Later, Hanna and Barbera seemed to suggest, through dialogue and occasional behavior, that the house was Mammy\'s own.  Mammy was originally voiced by well-known African-American character actress Lillian Randolph . In the 1960s, the MGM animation studio , by then under the supervision of Chuck Jones , created censored versions of the Tom & Jerry cartoons featuring Mammy for television. These versions used rotoscoping techniques to replace Mammy on-screen with a similarly stocky white woman (in most shorts) or a thin white woman (in Saturday Evening Puss); Randolph\'s voice on the soundtracks was replaced by an Irish-accented (or, in Puss, generic young adult) voice performed by white actress June Foray . [1]  The original versions of the cartoons were reinstated when Turner Broadcasting acquired ownership of the Tom & Jerry property. But in 1992, the cartoons featuring Mammy were edited again; this time, to replace Lillian Randolph\'s voice with that of Thea Vidale , who re-recorded the dialogue to remove Mammy\'s use of potentially offensive dialect . These re-recorded versions of the cartoons are aired to this day on Turner\'s Cartoon Network -related cable channels, and have at times turned up on DVD as well. However, some European TV showings of these cartoons, especially the UK, retain Randolph\'s original voice. The Region 2 Complete Collectors Edition DVD boxset has Vidale\'s voice on the first DVD and Randolph in a number of the episodes after that (such as A Mouse in the House and Mouse Cleaning ).  \xa0 Replacement characters for Mammy  From 1954\'s Pet Peeve , Mammy disappeared from Tom and Jerry; the owners of the animals\' house became a young, white, middle-class couple named Joan and George , and starting with 1955\'s The Flying Sorceress , the audience was able to see these owners\' heads.

Many versions conclude the game when the first person achieves a specified pattern from the drawn numbers. The winner is usually required to call out the word "Bingo!", which alerts the other players and caller of a possible win.  All wins are checked to make sure the person has not made a mistake before the win is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun. In this version of bingo, players compete against one another for the prize or jackpot.  Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement.  Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each jurisdiction\'s gambling laws regulating how the game is played.  There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play.  Some games require only one number to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern. See "Variations" for more details.  Bingo cards  The most common Bingo cards are flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper which contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical columns and five side to side rows. Each space in the grid contains a number.  A typical Bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75.  The five columns of the card are labeled \'B\', \'I\', \'N\', \'G\', and \'O\' from left to right.  The center space is usually marked "Free" or "Free Space", and is considered automatically filled.  The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the \'B\' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the \'I\' column containing only 16 through 30, \'N\' containing 31 through 45, \'G\' containing 46 through 60, and \'O\' containing 61 through 75.  The number of all possible Bingo cards with these standard features is P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,4) = 552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 or approximately 5.52×1026.  In U-Pick \'Em bingo and other variants of bingo, players are issued three 25 number cards which contain all 75 numbers that may be drawn.  Players then mark which numbers they wish to play and then daub those numbers according to the numbers drawn. In addition, double-action cards have two numbers in each square.  A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal. The most chips one can place on a Bingo board without having a Bingo is 19, not counting the free space. In order for this to happen, only one empty cell can reside in each row and each column, and at least one empty cell must be in each diagonal, for instance:  B I N G O  ● ● \xa0 ● ●  ● \xa0 ● ● ●  ● ● □ ● \xa0  ● ● ● \xa0 ●  \xa0 ● ● ● ●  In addition to a straight line, other patterns may be considered a valid bingo in special games. For example, in the illustration above, the 2x2 square of marked squares in the upper-right-hand corner would be considered a "postage stamp". Another common special game requires players to cover the four corners. There are several other patterns, such as a Roving \'L\', which requires players to cover all B\'s and top or bottom row or all O\'s and top or bottom row. Another common pattern is a blackout, covering all 24 numbers and the free space.

Soprano Susan Bullock, who sings the central role of Queen Elizabeth in a new production, on Britten\'s unjustly neglected opera  Susan Bullock, second from right, as Queen Elizabeth l in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, London. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian.  Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone.

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

On this special day, the people of Munich were invited to participate in the celebration which was held for five days on the fields in front of the city gates. What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair. From that day on, the festivities have continued more or less on an annual basis (outside of the 24 times it was canceled due to war and cholera).\xa0  "What may have started as an average alcohol-fueled wedding party has since turned into the world’s largest fair."\xa0  Over the decades, the festival has evolved into an elaborate affair spanning from late September to early October.

And if it’s a pretty crowded day, you’ll be better off remaining at the table instead of venturing off to another tent where you’ll likely meet another long wait. Note that tents will be closed if they become too full, and will be re-opened later when more space is available.

As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up.

The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...  May I submit for inclusion, Your Honour, this most British of all lawyers...  This proud, this defiant Old Bailey Hack...  With his best gal, Hilda, She Who Must Be Obeyed, standing, NOT amused, by his side...  The one, the only...  HORACE RUMPOLE.

When war broke out, the French used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region (an area not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British), including the Huron, Mississauga, Ojibwa, Winnebago, and Potawatomi. The British were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations, and also by the Cherokee – until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

The school consisted of Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Empedocles.  It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus.  The Pluralists rejected the idea that the diversity of nature can be reduced to a single principle (monism).  Anaxagoras posited that nature contained an innumerable number of principles, while Empedocles reduced nature to four elements (fire, air, earth, and water) which could not be reduced to one another and which would be sufficient to explain change and diversity.   Leucippus  Leucippus ( ; Greek: Λεύκιππος , "Leúkippos"; fl.  5th cent.  BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory.  However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed.  As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus\'s word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century.  Furthermore, in his "Corpus Democriteum", Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus.  The present consensus among the world\'s historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical.  The matter must remain moot unless more information is forthcoming from the record. | Question: The Pluralist school is said to have included what creator of the theory of atomism?', ['Leucippus'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-2340'), ("Context: For a phylum with relatively few species, ctenophores have a wide range of body plans.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in "a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy"). Geneva was John Calvin\'s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the "Confederate Party", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies. Skylab was 30.2 metres (99 feet) in length and 6.7 metres (22 feet) in diameter and had a mass of about 75,000 kg (165,000 pounds). Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: A pulmonary artery is an artery in the pulmonary circulation that carries deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs .

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies.

Generally, "prime" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints.

There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

Status: \xa0 False.  Origins: \xa0 As Santa Claus and his reindeer are to the secular celebration of Christmas, so the three wise men and the creche are to the religious celebration.  Even most of the non-religious (or non-Christian) among us recognize the symbolism of the nativity scene: it depicts the biblical account of three wise men from the east who rode atop camels and followed a star to Bethlehem, bearing gifts for the newborn Christ child who lay in a manger.  The truth is, the Bible contains virtually none of these details.  They have all been added over the years from sources outside the Bible.  Mathew 2:1 tells us:  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to  Jerusalem . . .  That\'s  it.  Matthew doesn\'t say how many wise men came from the east, doesn\'t mention their names, and doesn\'t provide any details about how they made their journey.  It has generally been assumed that the wise men (or magi) were three in number because Matthew 2:11 makes mention of three gifts:  ". . . they  presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh."  The number of wise men is not specified in the Bible, however, and some Eastern religions have claimed up to twelve of them made the journey to Bethlehem.   The names of the wise men, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, do not come from the Bible and did not appear in Christian literature until over five hundred years after the birth of Jesus.  Nothing in the Bible says the wise men rode camels (or any other animal); they may have made their journey from the east on foot for all we know.  And despite the familiar lyrics of the Christmas carol "We Three Kings," no biblical source depicts the three wise men as kings.  (They were most likely learned men, perhaps astrologers.)  However many wise men there were, and however they got to Bethlehem, the Bible tells us they arrived just after the birth and found the baby Jesus in a manger, right?  Not quite.  Matthew 2:11 states:  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped  him . . .  The wise men came "into the house," not the stable, and they saw a "young child," not a newborn.  This passage indicates that the wise men didn\'t arrive until quite some time after Jesus\' birth.  (According to  Luke 2,  it was shepherds, not wise men, who visited the infant Jesus in the manger.)  To sum up: we know from the Bible that wise men came from the east, that they followed a star to Bethlehem to find the Christ child, and that they brought him gold, and frankincense and myrrh.  We must look to sources external to the Bible to find the origins of any of the other familiar details, however.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian.  Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone.

Uploaded on Jun 7, 2010  Nebuchadnezzar was the mighty King of the Babylonian Empire between 604 and 562 BC. Numerous cuneiform tablets and ancient texts speak of his wondrous achievements and prideful character. "Look at this, Babylon the great! And I built it all by myself, a royal palace adequate to display my honor and glory." Nebuchadnezzar trusted in his immense wealth and powerful warriors -- He had no room for God in his kingdom.  However, late in his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a philosophical wake-up call. Overnight, he went from mighty king to wandering madman, as he was stricken with a psycho-mania, which caused him to act like an animal. He grew long hair and nails, roaming about the countryside grazing on grass.  Seven years into his malady, Nebuchadnezzar returned to his senses; immediately, he knew his lifelong mistake. A once Godless ruler was now a God-fearing man. In fact, his own philosophical journey was recorded in the ancient texts of the prophet Daniel, who was living as a captive in Babylon:  "I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked to heaven. I was given my mind back and I blessed the High God, thanking and glorifying God, who lives forever.  "At the same time that I was given back my mind, I was also given back my majesty and splendor, making my kingdom shine. All the leaders and important people came looking for me. I was reestablished as king in my kingdom and became greater than ever. And that\'s why I\'m singing -- I, Nebuchadnezzar -- singing and praising the King of Heaven:  "Everything he does is right, and he does it the right way. He knows how to turn a proud person into a humble man."  Nebuchadnezzar was a mighty king, ruling a vast kingdom. By the world\'s standards, he was the most powerful man of his day. However, through a season of humbling, Nebuchadnezzar came to recognize that God is a far mightier king, ruling a kingdom that is everlasting.

Category  Nebuchadnezzar - Indiana Jones Wiki - WikiaNebuchadnezzar | Indiana Jones Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Edit  The Babylonians worshipped\xa0 Marduk , the ruler of a dimension called the Aetherium . According to ancient passages discovered by Indiana Jones , Marduk inspired King Nebuchadnezzar through writing, urging him to build a " great engine "\xa0in order to physically contact Marduk \'s\xa0own, otherworldly realm. Following this, the scripture becomes unclear: "Having no understanding, the rabble hath thrown down his work." It is therefore uncertain whether the masses abandoned the machine in accord with Nebuchadnezzar\'s orders or against Nebuchadnezzar\'s orders; much of the controversy regards whether the phrase "his work" refers to the work of Nebuchadnezzar or Marduk.

They think it\'s all over - it is now!"

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

Luncheon of the Boating Party is one of Renoir´s final works depicting a sociable scene from his early life.  Luncheon of the Boating Party shows a group of Renoir´s friends relaxing and enjoying food, drinks and good conversation on a balcony at the Maison Fournaise in Chatou, France. Renoir often included close friends is his paintings and in this canvas he also includes his future wife, Aline Charigot, who can be seen in the left foreground playing with a small dog.  It seems that Renoir portrays his feelings for Aline by separating her from the others and she is the only cast member who does not engage in conversation or flirting but instead directs all of her attention at her dog. Renoir also reinforces Aline´s status in the painting by using brighter colors for some items of clothing.  In terms of other attendees, in the right foreground of the paintings wearing a straw hat is Gustave Caillebotte, one of Renoir\'s wealthier customers. Other participants include the artist Paul Lhote, the amateur art historian, collector, and editor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts Charles Ephrussi, French poet Jules Laforgue, actresses Ellen Andree, Jeanne Samary and Angele Legault, former mayor of colonial Saigon Baron Raoul Barbier, the proprietor´s children Louise-Alphonsine Fournaise and Alphonse Fournaise Jr. , bureaucrat Eugene Pierre Lestringez, and Italian journalist Maggiolo.  Luncheon of the Boating Party is among Renoir´s most famous canvases and it is a true representation both this period of time and Impressionism.  Luncheon of the Boating Party Inspirations for the Work  Edgar Degas  Antoine Watteau  It was in 1868 that Renoir first discovered Chatou and he instantly fell in love with it. After discovering the Restaurant Fournaise, Renoir became a regular guest. During his career, the artist painted no less than thirty canvasses in Chatou - many in the restaurant itself and other of the proprietor\'s family and the surrounding areas.  Luncheon of the Boating Party was intended to replicate everyday modern life and Renoir was eager to display his work at the official Salon Des Arts. However, the famous collector Paul Durand-Ruel purchased the canvas for the 7th Impressionist Exhibition instead, despite Renoir\'s wishes.  Many art historians suggest that Luncheon of the Boating Party was a response to a challenge printed in the June review of the official Salon exhibition of 1880 by famous writer and critic Emile Zola. Zola condemned the Impressionists saying: "they show their works while incomplete, illogical, exaggerated... " Zola dared the Impressionists to produce more completed and complicated modern-day paintings and so it could be the case that Renoir\'s ambitious project with Luncheon of the Boating Party, its lengthy execution and detailed arrangement are a response to Zola\'s challenge.  Others believe that Renoir created this painting as a direct response to the disbanding of the \'brotherhood\' of French Impressionist artists such as Renoir, Monet, Caillebotte, Pissaro, Sisley, Cezanne and Marisot. It was around this time that Degas declared that these artists could not contribute work to both the official Salon and the separate Impressionist show which resulted in Renoir, Monet, Sisley and Cezanne being excluded.  As well as this, Degas was introducing new, younger artists to the Impressionist movement and so it could be that Renoir was keen to reinforce his status as one of the movement\'s greatest painters and therefore set about working on this canvas.  There are many other possible inspirations for Luncheon of the Boating Party given the fact that Renoir was so passionate about his work and drew inspiration from a variety of sources. The artists\' admiration for the history of art and the works exhibited in the Louvre in Paris continued to motivate him throughout his career.  It\'s likely that for Luncheon of the Boating Party Renoir was influenced by Paolo Veronese\'s grand banquet scene, The Marriage Feast at Cana | Question: Who painted Luncheon of the Boating Party?', ['renoir', 'auguste renoir'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1423'), ('Context: Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia, fighting against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet).

Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston). | Question: Of what were materials that left little residue thought to contain?', ['phlogiston'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3490'), ('Context: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 Swedish-American psychological thriller film based on the novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson. This film adaptation was directed by David Fincher and written by Steven Zaillian. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.  Blomkvist breaks into Martin\'s house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  Special relationships exist between the measures of consecutive angles, opposite angles and opposite sides of a parallelogram. A square is the most straightforward parallelogram, because it has 2 sets of parallel sides. Naturally, all of its angles and sides match in length or measure.  Facts About a Parallelogram  (1) The degree measure of the four angles of a parallelogram add up to 360 degrees. Remember that all quadrilaterals (4 sided figures) have angles which add up to 360 degrees. Here's a sample:  Then: a + b + c + d = 360 degrees  (2) The degree measure of any two consecutive angles add up to 180 degrees.                 In parallelogram ABCD:  angle a + angle b = 180 degrees  angle b + angle c = 180 degrees  angle c + angle d = 180 degrees  angle a + angle d = 180 degrees  (3) Opposite angles have the same measure in terms of degrees.  In parallelogram ABCD:  (1) Opposite sides are parallel:  side AD || side BC  NOTE: The symbol || means parallel.  (2) Opposite sides have the same lengths:  side AD = side BC  side AB = side CD  Diagonals of a Parallelogram  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two side-by-side triangles.  As shown in the picture below, diagonal AC forms equal alternate interior angles with each pair of parallel sides.  We can also see that there are two triangles in the picture below.  Triangle 1 is congruent to triangle 2 by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Method.  Where did the two triangles come from?  They were formed by diagonal AC.  I should also note that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other as shown in the picture below.  AE = EC  where E is the midpoint of BOTH diagonals.

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts.  The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region.  The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. While some of the northern outposts of Aragon are inaccessible in winter because of snow, the region is, on the whole, fairly dry, enjoying a humid, Mediterranean-style climate in many areas.  Like most of Spain, Aragon was under the domination of the Moors from the 8th to the 14th centuries. However, many Muslims decided to remain in Aragon after the Christian Re-conquest, resulting in a style of architecture that is unique to Aragon.  Mudejar – meaning “those who are allowed to stay” – is a form of architecture employing bricks, plaster and the repetitive geometric patterns characteristic of early Islamic art. The buildings are finished off with ceramic tiles. The city of Teruel and the town of Calatayud are home to some of the best examples of Mudejar architecture.  Aragon may be best known for the marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla in 1469, which effectively created modern Spain. Their youngest daughter, Katherine of Aragon, became the first queen of Henry VIII of England.  Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in Spain, and funded Christopher Columbus’ expedition to America in 1492. For these accomplishments, they were dubbed “The Catholic Monarchs” by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. Everywhere in Aragon, there are reminders of the long, colorful history of Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign.  Abiding traditions  Aragon is steeped in tradition, and bull fighting and bull running play a major part in Aragonese culture. Most towns and villages hold some sort of bull festival in September; people who have issues with the ethics of bull fighting may be uncomfortable living in a region where the traditional is such an intrinsic part of local culture.  Aragon is also famous for the Jota, an energetic 17th-century dance particular to the region. While the flamenco, which originated in Andalucia, is now performed all over Spain, the Jota remains the proud possession of Aragonese culture. Both men and women perform the Jota, which involves a lot of noise and leaping around.  Moving to Aragon  Aragon has a population of around 1.3 million, of which over 10%, or about 173,000, are foreigners.  These come from all over the world, as there is significant foreign investment in the region. General Motors, Bosch Siemens and Adidas all have major plants in Aragon.  Property prices in Aragon are very competitive. On average, houses in Aragon are 56% cheaper than the national average.  Away from the regional capital of Zaragoza, which houses more than half of the region’s population, Aragon is sparsely populated. There are only two other cities– Teruel and Huesca – in all of Aragon. For those who want to get away from it all, Aragon is the place to do it.

Nicknamed “The Tin Man”, and described as “as the best all-round jockey that the turf has ever seen”, Archer was the holder of several records which lasted deep into the 20th century. He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, claiming 2,748 victories from 8,064 starts. He won a total of 21 classic races, including Epson Derby five times. He committed suicide at the age of 29 after the loss of his wife during childbirth.  Sir Gordon Richards (5 May 1904 – 10 November 1986) was one of the England’s finest jockeys, often considered the world’s greatest ever jockey. He is still the only jockey to have been knighted. Gordon Richard was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times. He amassed a total of 4,870 winners, and a record 12 consecutive winners ridden. In 1999, the Racing Post (leading racing newspaper in Britain) placed him at number 1 in their list of the top 50 jockeys of 20th century.  Lester Piggott (born 5 November 1935) – is a retired professional jockey and one of the most successful English flat racing jockeys of all time. Nicknamed “The Long Fellow” to his height, Lester Piggott introduced a new style of race-riding that was adopted all over the world and enabled him to become Champion Jockey eleven times. Piggott boasts 4,493 career wins including 30 British classics.  William Lee “Bill” Shoemaker (August 19, 1931 – October 12, 2003) is one of the all-time legends who have graced the sport. Referred to as “The Shoe”, he held the world record of number of professional jockey victories for 29 years. Shoemaker used his small size (1.50 m) to his advantage riding 8,833 winners. A high school dropout, Shoemaker went to ride a total of 40,350 races, and win the United States Champion Jockey by earnings , a record 10 times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1958.  Russell Avery Braze (born 7 August 1958) is the record holder of the most race wins in North American horse racing history . He’s victory counter stopped at the astonishing 12,007 number. Baze won 400 or more races per year for four consecutive years and got rewarded with a special Eclipse Award in 1995. Since then he has on over 400 races a year seven additional times; an achievement that no other jockey has accomplished more than three times. Russell Baze was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. He also received the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 2002.  Julieann Louise “Julie” Krone (born July 24, 1963) is one of the most successful female jockeys in North American horse racing history. Julie became the first female to win a Triple Crown Race when she claimed the Belmont Stakes, riding on Colonial Affair. She sustained number of severe injuries while racing, but always came back stronger. Because of her never give up attitude, Krone was named by USA Today as one of the 10 Toughest Athletes and was honored with the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award by the Women’s Sports Foundation.

Signor Mussolini remained self-composed, reassured his entourage, and while pressing a handkerchief to the wound, gave orders that no reprisals were to be carried out against his assailant, who had been arrested.

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ("Context: UK Butterflies - Red Admiral - Vanessa atalantaUK Butterflies - Red Admiral - Vanessa atalanta  < Previous Species Next Species >  Introduction  The Red Admiral is a frequent visitor to gardens throughout the British Isles and one of our most well-known butterflies. This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

Was He More than an Exodus Hero? - Biblical Archaeology Society  Who Was Moses? Was He More than an Exodus Hero?  Discovering the Biblical Moses  Read Peter Machinist’s article “The Man Moses” as it originally appeared in Bible Review, April 2000. The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.  Postcards from Paradise is officially out on March 31. For more on Ringo visit ringostarr.com .

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

Since then, the plot of the novel has woven its way into popular culture: Captain Ahab and the hunt for the White Whale continue to spark adaptations, reworkings, and allusions, while the opening line, "Call me Ishmael," remains one of the most well-known first words in fiction. However, Ishmael both as narrator and character has been primarily the property of academic rather than popular culture. Particularly following F. O. Matthiessen s classic American Renaissance, published in 1941 in the midst of the Nazi aggression, Ishmael has been appropriated by critics intent upon finding in him the figure of resistance to totalitarianism and fulfillment of democratic freedom. Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity. But the Holocaust (the Shoah) effectively marks the final collapse of traditional Western humanism. Jewish thinkers such as George Steiner and Emmanuel Levinas have been reassessing this collapse and its consequences. Both suggest alternative Jewish humanisms that reread Western culture and literature through a "Holocaust hermeneutics" that ethicizes and morally impassions the act of reading, studying, and responding to texts, and that elevates the role of the textual and human Other to one of primacy and priority. Rereading Moby-Dick under Steinerian and Levinasian norms reveals an Ishmael whose dealings with the Other pose troubling ethical questions in a post-Shoah world, and challenges the traditional "Cold War consensus" that makes of Ishmael the American emblem of Western freedom and humanitarianism  Subject  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEAHey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEA  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe?  December 18, 2015  CallMeIshmael.jpg  The rotary pay phones used for the Call Me Ishmael project. Photo by Logan Smalley  It started as so many good things do: over a drink. Logan Smalley and Stephanie Kent were at a bar one evening in New York when the conversation turned to books, and specifically, to first sentences of novels. In any such conversation, three words in particular are invariably mentioned: “Call me Ishmael,” the iconic opening of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. What came next was a question that in hindsight, seems unthinkable no one had ever asked before: What if you really could call Ishmael? “We quickly realized that it was a pun worth keeping,” Smalley said.  Smalley and Kent set to work creating Call Me Ishmael , a platform for people to tell personal stories about books they love, with the hopes of connecting people with their next great read. They set up a cell phone number for Ishmael, which goes straight to voice mail and prompts people to anonymously leave a message about “a book you’ve loved and a story you’ve lived.” A few\xa0times a week, Smalley transcribes a message by typewriter, filming the text as it scrolls up the typewriter carriage in time to the audio.  Although Smalley is no literary luddite—he and Kent both read and e-read—he said this particular project called for something more tangible than is typical in our digital age. “[People] want to call a complete stranger and tell them the really profound and potentially really personal story about how a book has affected them,” said Smalley. “That exchange, to us, necessitates something that feels very handmade and safe and comfortable, and gets a legitimate treatment.

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time.  During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north.  Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp.  Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced.  Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints.  Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life.  Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles.  Last time I checked, a painting of Rubens, 'Massacre of the Innocents', still holds the record as the most expensive painting by an old master, sold at auction (Sotheby's, 49.5 million Pounds).

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.

He is a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment, as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film, Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he starred as troubled teenager Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his stardom were loner Cal Trask in East of Eden (1955) and surly ranch hand Jett Rink in Giant (1956). Dean's enduring fame and popularity rest on his performances in only these three films, all leading roles.  Revealed: the truth behind the crash that killed James Dean  For James Dean fans it has been the ultimate unsolved riddle. Just who was behind the wheel the day the actor, only 24, died?  For 50 years, since his death in a car crash on September 30, 1955, Dean has been portrayed as a daredevil driver whose speeding and recklessness on the road caused his own death.  Now, new evidence has emerged proving that not only was Dean driving safely, but at a much lower speed than was believed at the time.  What type of visitor are you?  At 5:45 PM on September 30, 1955, 24-year-old actor James Dean is killed in Cholame, California, when the Porsche he is driving hits a Ford Tudor sedan at an intersection.   The driver of the other car, 23-year-old California Polytechnic State University student Donald Turnupseed, was dazed but mostly uninjured; Dean’s passenger, German Porsche mechanic Rolf Wütherich was badly injured but survived.   Only one of Dean’s movies, “East of Eden,” had been released at the time of his death (“Rebel Without a Cause” and “Giant” opened shortly afterward), but he was already on his way to superstardom--and the crash made him a legend.  September 30, 1955 : James Dean dies - HistorySeptember 30, 1955 : James Dean dies  Introduction  On this day in 1955, movie star James Dean dies at age 24 in a car crash on a California highway. Dean was driving his Porsche 550 Spyder, nicknamed “Little Bastard,” headed to a car race in Salinas, California, with his mechanic Rolf Wuetherich, when they were involved in a head-on collision with a car driven by a 23-year-old college student named Donald Turnaspeed. Dean was taken to Paso Robles War Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:59 p.m. Wuetherich, who was thrown from the car, survived the accident and Turnaspeed escaped with minor injuries. No charges were ever filed against him.  James Byron Dean was born February 8, 1931, in Marion, Indiana. He studied drama at the University of California, Los Angeles, before moving to New York City, where he appeared in plays and TV shows and took classes at the Actors Studio with legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg.  Dean rose to stardom in 1955 with his role as Cal Trask in East of Eden. He reportedly beat out Paul Newman for the part. Dean’s performance in the film, based on the John Steinbeck novel, earned him a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. It was the first time in Oscar history that an actor was nominated after his death. The young actor’s next film was “Rebel Without a Cause,” also released in 1955, in which he played a rebellious teen named Jim Stark. The film, which co-starred Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, turned Dean into the poster boy for disaffected youth and cool. Dean’s final film “Giant,” released in 1956 after his death, was an epic tale of a Texas cattle rancher and his family. Dean starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson and was nominated posthumously for a second Oscar for his performance as Jett Rink.

Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian  Share on Messenger  Close  Schnitzel, beloved of gambolling nuns , is one of those dishes that\'s mysteriously more than the sum of its parts. With the (very) honourable exceptions of chicken kiev and scotch eggs , I haven\'t eaten much breaded meat since leaving school, yet somehow, this simple classic, like its Milanese cousin, manages to be both elegant, and utterly satisfying. After this week, it might just be one of my favourite things.  The meat  Melissa Clark\'s wiener schnitzel.  Veal is the traditional choice in Vienna itself, though in the countryside, cheaper, more widely available pork is popular. Schnitzel can, of course, be made from almost any meat that comes in pieces large enough to fit the bill, and I do try a chicken schnitzel from New York Times food writer Melissa Clark , more for her slightly unusual method (of which more later) than for any hope of culinary revelation from the poultry itself. Of all the schnitzel I try, it reminds me most of the children\'s menu; chicken just doesn\'t have the same depth of flavour as pork or veal.  Pork schnitzel, which the Carinthian-born Wolfgang Puck fondly recalls from the Sunday lunches of his childhood , is undeniably good; juicy and flavourful. But the veal I try is something else; the milky flavour works wonderfully with the buttery breadcrumbs. If you can find British rose veal ( it\'s available online if your butcher or supermarket doesn\'t carry it), it\'s well worth the investment here.  Veal in this country is often just sold under the label "escalopes", but look for a slightly fattier cut if possible – Austrian restaurant Boopshi\'s recommends loin, topside or rump , and Vienna restaurant Figlmüeller favours top loin for its tenderness. Escalope or not, you\'ll need to beat it as thin as possible; Michelin-starred Austrian chef Kurt Gutenbrunner suggests 3mm as the figure to aim for, while Figlmüeller prides itself on hammering each and every schnitzel out to 30cm diameter. This means starting with a larger piece of meat than I\'d usually serve at home, but you get the general idea – too thick, and the crumbs will overcook before the meat is done. Just don\'t hammer it into cobwebs.  The coating  Kurt Gutenbrunner\'s wiener schnitzel.  According to the writer Joseph Wechsberg , a good wiener schnitzel should boast breading "so dry you could sit on it without having a fat stain on your pants". Now, Wechsberg ate at some of the finest restaurants of pre war Europe, so I\'m loth to argue with him and his impeccably clean pants, but my experience suggests you can take this too far. For a start, while he would surely have frowned on Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham\'s fresh white breadcrumbs, which give The Prawn Cocktail Years schnitzel a softly greasy (and utterly delectable) coating, I can\'t believe he would have embraced the Japanese panko crumbs recommended by Puck. They\'re just too dry and crunchy. Dry breadcrumbs (easy to make at home by putting fresh crumbs in a low oven for half an hour or so, then blitzing them up again) are a happy compromise; crisp, without being abrasive. Boopshi\'s recommends using crusty kaiser rolls, which aren\'t easy to come by here, but a standard white loaf seems to do the trick.  It\'s not just about the crumbs – the veal is rolled in flour, to help the coating stick, and then beaten egg too. Adding cream to the egg layer, as Gutenbrunner suggests, may be unorthodox, but it gives his coating a lovely richness missing from the more puritan water | Question: If you were making a wiener schnitzel what meat would you buy?', ['veal'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1742'), ("Context: Rock (Nominees) Ltd v RCO Holdings Ltd  Rock Nominees Ltd was part of the business empire of Lord Ashcroft, a Tory peer who has been criticised for offshore tax avoidance.

Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time.  During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north.  Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp.  Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced.  Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints.  Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life.  Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R. Mead, an associate of Jesse Chisholm in the early-day trading business.

The buzz-off for control of the board  If it wasn\'t the top answer then the opposing team were allowed to guess. Whoever had the most popular answer got to take the question for their team (they could pass it if they wanted, but that was a rare occurrence).

However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award.

The grand event takes place at the famous “Theresienwiese” field where large tents are constructed over a three month period that begins in the summer.\xa0  Oktoberfest dates back to the marriage celebration of Prince Ludwig to Princess Therese in 1810. On this special day, the people of Munich were invited to participate in the celebration which was held for five days on the fields in front of the city gates.

You may enter both the festival and tents free of charge (with the exception of the “Historical Wies’n” which requires a small fee). Oktoberfest showcases 14 spectacular tents with 1,000 - 8,500 seats which are owned by various restaurants, breweries and other establishments. There are also a number of smaller tents and beer gardens in the vicinity.\xa0  All tents are unique and have their own charm, so if you have the time, we recommend trying to check them all out! The tents serve Bavarian beers, traditional eats, and are booming with live music throughout the day and night. Music performances are comprised of a mix of both traditional Bavarian music and contemporary bands playing later in the evenings.\xa0  While it’s possible to visit all of the tents, the issue is whether or not you can get a seat, especially on weekends and during bad weather. Although tents do offer reservations, they can be next to impossible to get. Reservations are typically given to large German companies and groups, and the tents always serve their existing customers from previous years first.\xa0  The remaining requests are put on a daunting waiting list; nonetheless, it’s still worth a shot! If you’re travelling in a small group of 2 or 3, you can patiently wait until someone leaves, and then quickly grab their table. And if it’s a pretty crowded day, you’ll be better off remaining at the table instead of venturing off to another tent where you’ll likely meet another long wait. Note that tents will be closed if they become too full, and will be re-opened later when more space is available. For a map and details on the fourteen tents, check out Oktoberfest’s Tent Guide with photos and descriptions of each tent.  Beer & Other Beverages  The Oktoberfest beer is by far the event’s most popular attraction. Large one liter beers are served in traditional German “Maß” mugs. The Club of Munich Brewers maintains strict regulations on exactly which brands of beer can be served at the festival. There are currently only 6 breweries whose beer meets the criteria. In doing so they must adhere to the Bavarian Purity Laws established for beer brewing in 1487 and the beers must be brewed within Munich city limits.

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil\'s people", and referred to them with violent, vile language.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?"

While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.  Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become \'\'a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,\'\' the Prince said, \'\'I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.\'\' But then he added, \'\'Look, if a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which | Question: "Who famously said after the \'Dunblane Massacre\', ""If a cricketer for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats""?" ?', ['duke of edinburgh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6259'), ('Context: Freeway Warrior  Freeway Warrior is a series of 4 gamebooks, created by Joe Dever.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.  All four of us went for a ride on the Luas from Milltown to Sandyford and back. During the journey we chatted about the trams as opposed to the buses.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

She held a bouquet in one hand and with the other picked furiously at something stuck on the ice, desperate to ensure the surface was perfect for the two competitors waiting their turn. Out of sight, they watched and a country watched with them, millions upon millions waiting, united in a universal anxiety. Perfection was not to be long delayed.  Satisfied with her precise labours, the girl made for the small gate that led off the ice. Jayne Torvill smiled down at her as she scrambled off, her skates now a clumsy hindrance. Alongside Torvill, Christopher Dean stared ahead, inscrutable, his face a mask of calm, his long slender neck, accentuated by his collarless top, giving him the serene air of a swan on the summer water.  The ice was Dean\'s natural habitat, and, at last, the girl banished contentedly into the depths of the Zetra stadium, he led his partner on to the rink.  The gate was closed behind them and they skated briskly to the centre, the brilliance of the ice and the whitewashed wall blurring the spectators and highlighting Torvill and Dean, each clad in billowing tops of darkening purple, he in black trousers and black skates, she in a short dress, also purple, and white skates.

His most famous works are Treasure Island, Kidnapped, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and A Child\'s Garden of Verses.  A literary celebrity during his lifetime, Stevenson now ranks among the 26 most translated authors in the world.  His works have been admired by many other writers, including Jorge Luis Borges, Bertolt Brecht, Marcel Proust, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, Cesare Pavese, Ernest Hemingway, Rudyard Kipling, Jack London, Vladimir Nabokov,  J. M. Barrie,  and G. K. Chesterton, who said of him that he "seemed to pick the right word up on the point of his pen, like a man playing spillikins."   Life  Childhood and youth  Stevenson was born at 8\xa0Howard Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, on 13 November 1850 to Thomas Stevenson (1818–87), a leading lighthouse engineer, and his wife Margaret Isabella (née Balfour; 1829–97). He was christened Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, Stevenson was to change the spelling of "Lewis" to "Louis", and in 1873 he dropped "Balfour."    Lighthouse design was the family\'s profession: Thomas\'s father (Robert\'s grandfather) was the famous Robert Stevenson, and both of Thomas\'s brothers (Robert\'s uncles) Alan and David, were in the same field.  Indeed, even Thomas\'s maternal grandfather, Thomas Smith, had been in the same profession. However, Robert\'s mother\'s family were not of the same profession. Margaret\'s natal family, the Balfours, were gentry, tracing their lineage back to a certain Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchyra in Fife in the fifteenth century. Margaret\'s father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton,  and her siblings included the physician George William Balfour and the marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather\'s house. "Now I often wonder," wrote Stevenson, "what I inherited from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them."   Lewis Balfour and his daughter both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when the family moved to a damp, chilly house at 1\xa0Inverleith Terrace in\xa01851.  The family moved again to the sunnier 17\xa0Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was eleven. Illness would be a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin.  Contemporary views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis  or even sarcoidosis.   Stevenson\'s parents were both devout and serious Presbyterians, but the household was not strict in its adherence to Calvinist principles. His nurse, Alison Cunningham (known as Cummy),  was more fervently religious. Her Calvinism and folk beliefs were an early source of nightmares for the child, and he showed a precocious concern for religion.  But she also cared for him tenderly in illness, reading to him from Bunyan and the Bible as he lay sick in bed and telling tales of the Covenanters.

Many versions conclude the game when the first person achieves a specified pattern from the drawn numbers. The winner is usually required to call out the word "Bingo!", which alerts the other players and caller of a possible win.  All wins are checked to make sure the person has not made a mistake before the win is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun. In this version of bingo, players compete against one another for the prize or jackpot.  Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement.  Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each jurisdiction\'s gambling laws regulating how the game is played.  There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play.  Some games require only one number to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern. See "Variations" for more details.  Bingo cards  The most common Bingo cards are flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper which contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical columns and five side to side rows. Each space in the grid contains a number.  A typical Bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75.  The five columns of the card are labeled \'B\', \'I\', \'N\', \'G\', and \'O\' from left to right.  The center space is usually marked "Free" or "Free Space", and is considered automatically filled.  The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the \'B\' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the \'I\' column containing only 16 through 30, \'N\' containing 31 through 45, \'G\' containing 46 through 60, and \'O\' containing 61 through 75.  The number of all possible Bingo cards with these standard features is P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,5) × P(15,4) = 552,446,474,061,128,648,601,600,000 or approximately 5.52×1026.  In U-Pick \'Em bingo and other variants of bingo, players are issued three 25 number cards which contain all 75 numbers that may be drawn.  Players then mark which numbers they wish to play and then daub those numbers according to the numbers drawn. In addition, double-action cards have two numbers in each square.  A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal. The most chips one can place on a Bingo board without having a Bingo is 19, not counting the free space. In order for this to happen, only one empty cell can reside in each row and each column, and at least one empty cell must be in each diagonal, for instance:  B I N G O  ● ● \xa0 ● ●  ● \xa0 ● ● ●  ● ● □ ● \xa0  ● ● ● \xa0 ●  \xa0 ● ● ● ●  In addition to a straight line, other patterns may be considered a valid bingo in special games. For example, in the illustration above, the 2x2 square of marked squares in the upper-right-hand corner would be considered a "postage stamp". Another common special game requires players to cover the four corners. There are several other patterns, such as a Roving \'L\', which requires players to cover all B\'s and top or bottom row or all O\'s and top or bottom row. Another common pattern is a blackout, covering all 24 numbers and the free space.

However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options.

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY     1900  •S     Anthony van Dyck.      aking into consideration the intellectual life of the  Flemish and of the Dutch in general, the painters are  undoubtedly the most gifted of our countrymen. The  taste for Art was most lavishly bestowed upon them,  they have been the creating genius of our race, men with  keener eyes and more subtle feeling and with a hand more cunning  than the majority of their "fellow countrymen. They have been  instrumental in bringing the people of the low-lying countries to the  fore, causing them to rank amongst the highest in the Ideal world.  Now the most poetical of these painters was Anthony van Dyck, that is  to say if one understands by that word « poetical » a certain suscep-  tibility for impressions, and an inclination to be touched by emotions,  as may be termed sorrowful, suffering and tender.   Van Dyck was endowed with more feeling than strength, he  offered apparently but little resistance to the influence of others, yet  his natural disposition and his fine artistic taste were not submerged  by the powerful impression made on him by his illustrious prede-  cessors. These impressions, it may be said, he outgrew rather than  threw off, and drifted unconsciously into an independence which  ripened and matured through the increasing power of his matchless  talent. Born in Antwerp, of the bluest blood, he loved his native town  and with true artistic feeling was carried away and enraptured by  all that may be called beautiful, brilliant and glowing ; he surpassed  all others by the sensibility of his character, by the distinction of his  style, by his power to charm and by his love of the eminent. The  tender graceful sensitiveness of his nature made him a striking contrast  to and a protest against that boorishness and sluggishness, which are  considered by some the characteristics of our nation.   Such van Dyck appears to us as artist when we take a broad and     impartial view of him, but upon a nearer acquaintance his talents  become more sharply defined, especially when viewed by the glimpses  we get of his life and from a closer examination of his work.   So too he appears to us as a man : of noble exterior, conscious of  his own worth, speaking by the spirit that vibrates through his whole  being and which overshadows his surroundings through the charm  of his personality. He looks what he is, the portrayer of princes, of  eminent men and of noble ladies, of Madonnas and Saints, and above  all the painter of the Man of Sorrows and the Mother of Woe.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: In 1999 the contribution of civil aircraft - in - flight to global CO emissions was estimated to be around 2 % .

A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two. | Question: If a force is pointing horizontally to the northeast, how many forces can you split the force into?', ['two'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10395'), ("Context: Triple Crown of Surfing  The Vans Triple Crown of Surfing is a Hawaiian specialty series of professional surfing events, offering three events to men and three events to women.

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000. Westwood has performed particularly well in European Tour events, having won a total of 18 tournaments, and in 2000 he achieved the European Tour Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s seven year run of victory.

The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. At any moment in time many individual lattice atoms will be away from their perfect lattice sites and this interferes with electron movement.  When the temperature coefficient is known, an adjusted resistivity value can be computed using the following formula:  R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1–T2)]  Where: R1 = resistivity value adjusted | Question: What electrical property, the reciprocal of resistivity, has the SI units Siemens per metre?', ['conductivity'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4196'), ("Context: Guthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to Matt Doherty , the head coach at Notre Dame and a player on the 1982 championship team , to lead the Tar Heels .

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva.

Last update: 7 February 2016  Google+175  History and origin  About a 35% of the world population drives on the left , and the countries that do are mostly old British colonies. This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world, but there is a perfectly good reason. Click here for a world map and a full list of all countries of the world and the side of the road on which they drive.  Right-handed knights preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent  In the past, almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.  Furthermore, a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse, and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword (which would be worn on the left). It is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road, rather than in the middle of traffic, so if one mounts on the left, then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road.  In the late 1700s, however, teamsters in France and the United States began hauling farm products in big wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. These wagons had no driver’s seat; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse, so he could keep his right arm free to lash the team. Since he was sitting on the left, he naturally wanted everybody to pass on the left so he could look down and make sure he kept clear of the oncoming wagon’s wheels. Therefore he kept to the right side of the road.  In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth (Elizaveta Petrovna) officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right.\xa0In addition, the French Revolution of 1789 gave a huge impetus to right-hand travel in Europe. The fact is, before the Revolution, the aristocracy travelled on the left of the road, forcing the peasantry over to the right, but after the storming of the Bastille and the subsequent events, aristocrats preferred to keep a low profile and joined the peasants on the right. An official keep-right rule was introduced in Paris in 1794, more or less parallel to Denmark, where driving on the right had been made compulsory in 1793.  French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1812)  Later, Napoleon’s conquests spread the new rightism to the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), Switzerland, Germany, Poland and many parts of Spain and Italy. The states that had resisted Napoleon kept left – Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Portugal. This European division, between the left- and right-hand nations would remain fixed for more than 100 years, until after the First World War.  Although left-driving Sweden ceded Finland to right-driving Russia after the Finnish War (1808-1809), Swedish law – including traffic regulations – remained valid in Finland for another 50 years. It wasn’t until 1858 that an Imperial Russian decree made Finland swap sides.

Catherine of Aragon, whose parents united Castile and Aragon with their marriage, was promised in marriage to the son of Henry VII of England, in order to promote the alliance between the Spanish and English rulers.  See: more Catherine of Aragon Facts  Catherine of Aragon Biography  Catherine of Aragon's role in history was, first, as a marriage partner to strengthen the alliance of England and Spain (Castile and Aragon), and later, as the center of Henry VIII's struggle for an annulment that would permit him to remarry and try for a male heir to the English throne for the Tudor dynasty . She was not simply a pawn in the latter, but her stubbornness in fighting for her marriage -- and her daughter's right to inherit -- were key in how that struggle ended, with Henry VIII separating the Church of England from the Church of Rome's authority.  continue reading below our video  What are the Seven Wonders of the World  Catherine of Aragon Family Background  Catherine of Aragon was the fifth child of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon. She was born in Alcalá de Henares.  Catherine was likely named for her mother's grandmother, Katherine of Lancaster, the daughter of Constance of Castile who was second wife of John of Gaunt, himself son of England's Edward III. Constance and John's daughter, Catherine of Lancaster, married Henry III of Castile and was the mother of John II of Castile, Isabella's father. Constance of Castile was the daughter of Peter (Pedro) of Castile, known as Peter the Cruel, who was overthrown by his brother Henry (Enrique) II. John of Gaunt tried to claim the throne of Castile on the basis of his wife Constance's descent from Peter.  Catherine's father Ferdinand was the great-grandson of Philippa of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt and his first wife, Blanche of Lancaster. Philippa's brother was Henry IV of England. Thus, Catherine of Aragon had considerable English royal heritage herself.  Her parents were also both part of the House of Trastámara, a dynasty that ruled kingdoms in the Iberian peninsula from 1369 to 1516, descended from King Henry (Enrique) II of Castile who overthrew his brother, Peter, in 1369, part of the War of the Spanish Succession -- the same Peter who was the father of Isabella's grandmother Constance of Castile , and the same Henry John of Gaunt tried to overthrow.  Catherine of Aragon Childhood and Education:  In her early years, Catherine traveled extensively within Spain with her parents as they fought their war to remove the Muslims from Granada.  Because Isabella regretted the lack of her own educational preparation when she became a ruling queen, she educated her daughters well, preparing them for their likely roles as queens. So Catherine had an extensive education, with many European humanists as her teachers. Among the tutors who educated Isabella, and then her daughters, was Beatriz Galindo . Catherine spoke Spanish, Latin, French and English, and was well-read in philosophy and theology.  Alliance with England Through Marriage  Catherine was born in 1485, the same year Henry VII seized the crown of England as the first Tudor monarch. Arguably, Catherine's own royal descent was more legitimate than Henry's, who was descended from their common ancestor John of Gaunt through the children of Katherine Swynford , his third wife, who were born before their marriage and later legitimized but declared ineligible for the throne.  In 1486, Henry's first son, Arthur was born. Henry VII sought powerful connections for his children through marriage; so did Isabella and Ferdinand. Ferdinand and Isabella first sent diplomats to England to negotiate Catherine's marriage to Arthur in 1487. The next year, Henry VII agreed to the marriage, and a formal agreement including dowry specifications was drwan up.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute  Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, is one of the most easily identified targets for astronomers, largely due to its large and distinct ring system. The rings of Saturn have fascinated stargazers for centuries, ever since telescopes were first pointed toward the sky.  When Galileo Galilei first observed Saturn in 1610, he thought that the rings were enormous moons, one positioned on each side of the planet. Over several years of observations, he noted that the rings changed shape and even disappeared , as they changed their inclination with respect to Earth.  We now know that Galileo was observing a "ring plane crossing." Saturn\'s equator is tilted relative to its orbit around the sun by 27 degrees – similar to Earth\'s 23-degree tilt. As Saturn circles the sun, first one hemisphere and then the other is tilted sunward. The tilt causes seasons, just as it does on Earth, and when Saturn reaches equinox, its equator and ring plane are directly in line with the sun. Sunlight hits the rings edge-on, and the fine line of the rings is difficult to detect. The rings are wide — 170,000 miles across (273,600 km) — but only about 30 feet (10 meters) thick.  In 1655, astronomer Christaan Huygens suggested that the strange bodies were solid, inclined rings, and in 1660 another astronomer suggested that the rings were made up of small satellites, an insight that wasn\'t confirmed for nearly 200 years.  In modern times, Pioneer 11 passed through the Saturn ring plane in 1979. In the 1980s, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 glimpsed the planet\'s ring system.  In 2004, NASA\'s Cassini-Huygens mission became the first to enter orbit around Saturn, taking detailed observations not only of the planet but of its ring system.  Details of Saturn\'s icy rings are visible in this sweeping view from Cassini of the planet\'s glorious ring system. The total span, from A ring to F ring, covers approximately 40,800 miles (65,700 km) and was photographed at Nov. 26, 2008.  Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute  Composition and structure  Saturn\'s rings are made up of billions of particles ranging from grains of sand to mountain-size chunks. Composed predominantly of water-ice, the rings also draw in rocky meteoroids as they travel through space.  Though Saturn appears surrounded by a single, solid ring when viewed by an amateur astronomer, several divisions exist. The rings are named alphabetically in the order of discovery. Thus the main rings are, from farthest from the planet to closest, A, B and C. A gap 2,920 miles wide (4,700 kilometers), known as the Cassini Division, separates the A and B rings.  Other, fainter rings have been discovered as telescope technology has improved. Voyager 1 detected the innermost D ring in 1980. The F ring lies just outside of the A ring, while the G and E ring lay even farther out.  The rings themselves contain a number of gaps and structures . Some are created by Saturn\'s many small moons, while others continue to puzzle to astronomers.  Saturn is not the only planet in the solar system to have rings — Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune also contain faint ring systems — but with its satellites spanning three-quarters of the Earth-moon distance (175,000 miles or 282,000 km), it is by far the largest and most visible.  Formation theories  Several hypotheses exist as to the how Saturn\'s rings were formed. Some scientists think that passing comets or asteroids were snagged by the planet\'s gravity and broken up before reaching it.

It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.  Things to Do and See in Coney Island  The Coney Island Museum  For less than a dollar, visitors can get to see artifacts that bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear Coney Island in this quaint museum.

The girl, just turned six, is improving her counting by determinedly calling out the number of each step.  ‘Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-NINE!’ she says in triumph as they step off onto the sand.  Thus Alice Buchan gave the title to her father’s, my grandfather’s, new novel, little knowing that it would prove to be one of the most enduring adventure stories ever to be published.  John Buchan wrote The 39 Steps in a few weeks towards the end of 1914, while staying with his wife and children at Broadstairs in Kent, in a house on the cliffs overlooking Stone Bay. (The house is still there; indeed, anyone wishing to re-enact the novel’s finale may rent it as a holiday let.)  While there, he became ill with the duodenal problems that plagued him all his life, and which had prevented him from joining the Army, Britain having declared war against Germany on August 4 that year. Two major elements among these facts – the clifftop setting and the coming of war – infuse what has come to be widely regarded as the first modern spy thriller.  Buchan posted the manuscript to Blackwood & Sons in Edinburgh, publisher not only of books but of the famous literary magazine that bore its name.  ‘It has amused me to write, but whether it will amuse you to read is another matter,’ he wrote.  He need not have fretted. Blackwood’s accepted it at once and published it in the magazine, in serial form and pseudonymously, between July and September 1915, and as a book under Buchan’s name in October. It was an immediate success – and more than that, it has become a classic of its kind.  Today, the principal charges levelled against the novel are that it is dated, and that it relies too heavily upon improbable circumstances or coincidences. Yet I would argue that even now, almost 100 years after it was first published, the story retains a modernity that is little short of astonishing.  Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, released in 1935, is an extremely well-made comedy thriller that's widely and deservedly admired  I am reminded of its place in our collective narrative by a cartoon I clipped from a newspaper a few years ago and pinned to my office wall. It shows a boy of about eight, standing in front of his parents.  He is wearing a tweed Norfolk jacket, a tie, breeches, chequered shooting stockings and what are no doubt stout brogues. Eyes closed as in serious thought, he is drawing on a pipe clamped between his teeth, the bowl of which he’s holding in his left hand. In his right, half wedged beneath his arm, he holds a copy of The 39 Steps. Anxiously, his mother is saying to her husband, ‘Why doesn’t he read Harry Potter, like other kids?’ Why indeed?  True, The 39 Steps isn’t read by the young (or old) in anything like the numbers that JK Rowling’s marvellous creation attracts, but it’s still in print nearly 100 years after its first publication; indeed, it has never been out of print, something that isn’t true of the works of, for instance, Jane Austen.

Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery  Cholecystectomy: Removal of the Gallbladder  The gallbladder is a small organ that is part of the human digestive system. It secretes bile, an enzyme that breaks down fats in food. Sometimes the gallbladder cannot work effectively, and instead of breaking down fats it begins to form lumps known as gallstones. When this happens, removal of the gallbladder – known as a cholecystectomy – may be necessary.  Traditional vs. laparoscopic cholecystectomy  Traditional cholecystectomy involved making a major incision and dislodging the liver in order to remove the gall bladder. This procedure was risky and required several days in the hospital as well as more than a month of recovery time.  The modern alternative, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, was developed in 1989. This procedure involves the insertion of a camera in a tube through the navel. Several small incisions are made, and the surgeon, guided by the camera, uses tiny instruments to cut the ducts and arteries that hold the gallbladder inside the body. When performed correctly, laparoscopic cholecystectomy poses less risk to the patient’s liver, reduces hospital stays, and cuts recovery time to less than a month. But laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an intricate and difficult procedure. Accidentally cutting or clipping the wrong duct or artery could have disastrous results for the patient.  Doctors performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy without proper experience  The best way for gallbladder patients to prevent complications from laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to choose a doctor who has performed many procedures. The National Institutes of Health became so concerned about the rate of patient injuries following laparoscopic cholecystectomy that a conference was convened to examine the issue. The conference found that training for laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been so irregular that an alarming number of doctors are not sufficiently competent to perform the procedure safely. Doctors with fewer than 25 procedures under their belts were more likely to identify the wrong duct or artery to cut and cause damage to the patient .  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy complications can be life-threatening  Because the gallbladder is situated close to many other vital organs (most prominently the liver), it is paramount that the surgeon performs the surgery correctly without cutting, clipping, or puncturing any other organs. When complications occur, they can include:  Jaundice  Infection or inflammation of the bile ducts causing digestive and liver problems  Damage to the liver, the intestines, or other nearby organs  Damage to the common bile duct, causing bile to enter the bloodstream or the abdominal cavity, thereby poisoning the patient  If the hepatic (liver) system is disrupted, or if the common bile duct is damaged, the patient is placed in a life-threatening situation that can swiftly degenerate to liver failure and even death. Emergency surgery is often required to correct complications of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and, even when it is successful, the patient may be sentenced to a life with permanent pain and impaired digestive function.

Published on Jan 22, 2015  Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen BEST AUDIO  There was once a woman who wished very much to have a little child, but she could not obtain her wish. At last she went to a fairy, and said, "I should so very much like to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?"     "Oh, that can be easily managed," said the fairy. "Here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer\'s fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen."     "Thank you," said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud.     "It is a beautiful flower," said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of "Thumbelina," or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat. Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair. It really was a very pretty sight. Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard.  Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen BEST AUDIO  Please subscribe for more great audio books.

In the first English translation of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale opens with a beggar woman giving a peasant\'s wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants the miniature maiden as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag-beetle. The insect discards her when his friends reject her company. Thumbelina tries to protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits.

"An adult human brain has more than 100 billion neurons"  >\xa0100 billion  One of the most remarkable aspects of the adult nervous system is the human brain. The human brain controls memory, vision, learning, thought, consciousness and other activities. By means of electrochemical impulses the brain directly controls conscious or voluntary behavior. It also monitors, through feedback circuitry, most involuntary behavior and influences automatic activities of the internal organs.  During fetal development the foundations of the mind are laid as billions of neurons form appropriate connections and patterns. No aspect of this complicated structure has been left to chance. The basic wiring plan is encoded in the genes. It has been shown from previous studies that in developing embryos of animals, nerve cells are created in or travel to designated regions of the brain, and once in place send out axons along preprogrammed paths to make contact with specific targets.  The brain\'s billions of neurons connect with one another in complex networks. All physical and mental functioning depends on the establishment and maintenance of neuron networks. A person\'s habits and skills -- such as nail-biting or playing a musical instrument -- become embedded within the brain in frequently activated neuron networks. When a person stops performing an activity, the neural networks for the activity fall into disuse and eventually may disappear.  Differences in weight and size of a person\'s brain does not correlate with differences in mental ability. The adult human brain normally weighs from 1.0 to 1.5\xa0kg (2¼ to 3¼\xa0lbs).

Older estimates have long suggested that 100 billion was the magic number, but some more recent research suggests that the brain actually contains fewer neurons than previously believed.  The human brain is made up of a complex network of neurons . These neurons serve as the building blocks of the nervous system, transmitting information to and from the brain and throughout the body.  You probably expect that a large number of neurons are required for such a complex process, but just how many neurons are there in the human brain?  How Many Neurons are in the Human Brain?  According to many estimates, the human brain contains around 100 billion neurons (give or take a few billion). This estimate has often been reported for many years in neuroscience and psychology textbooks and for many years was simply accepted as a relatively close approximation.  Recently, however, Brazilian researcher Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel discovered that these estimates might not be entirely accurate. While the number is widely cited, she found that no one seemed to know where this number originated. She then decided to investigate in order to determine if the number is accurate. | Question: The human brain is made up of between 10 billion and 100 billion nerve cells known as what?', ['nerve cells', 'neuron', 'neurons'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1877'), ('Context: Concentrated O2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically.

It included areinforced Canadian infantry division, a large proportion of the Royal Air Force fighterforce, and a significant naval armada. In the early hours of 19 August 1942 an amphibious force of approximately 6000 troops, primarily Canadians of the 2nd Infantry Division, approached the coast of France. About one thousand British troops and fifty US Rangers also took part. Their destination was the small port of Dieppe.  On 02 April 1942 General Marshall gave President Roosevelt the War Department\'s outline plan for a cross-Channel attack in 1943. During the summer of 1942 small task forces would raid along the entire accessible enemy coast line. General Marshall attached great value to these preparatory raiding operations which he defined as the "establishment of a preliminary active front." He thought they might serve to draw German troops from the east and so "be of some help to Russia." They might also be useful for deception either in persuading the Germans that no all-out offensive would be attempted or else in keeping them on tenterhooks for fear that any one of the raids might develop into a full-scale invasion. Thinking of national morale, a consideration always important to both the President and the Prime Minister, he noted that raiding together with air operations would be "of immediate satisfaction to the public." But, he added, "what is most important" is that the raids would "make experienced veterans of the air and ground units, and . . . offset the tendency toward deterioration in morale which threatens the latter due to prolonged inactivity."  The most ambitious attack on the French coast up to that time had been the raid on St. Nazaire in March 1942. But St. Nazaire was still only a hit-and-run commando foray. Dieppe was planned as a miniature invasion, involving the full use of combined arms and mass landings of infantry and armor with the object of seizing a beachhead. Except that there was no intention of holding the beachhead, Dieppe was drawn as closely as possible to the pattern of a full-scale amphibious attack. Specifically it was designed to test the newly developed LCT in landing tanks across the beaches and to find out whether it would be possible to take a port by direct frontal assault. It would also test naval organization in managing a considerable landing fleet (253 ships and craft), and air organization in gaining air supremacy over the landing area and providing support for the ground troops.  Their mission was to foster German fear of an attack in the West and compel them to strengthen their Channel defenses at the expense of other operational areas. The raid is often largely (and wrongly) attributed to a British effort to deflect Russian and American pressure for an early, and primarily British, cross-Channel invasion. Their secondary purpose was to learn as much as possible about new techniques and equipment and gain experience and knowledge necessary for a future great amphibious assault. As Dieppe was considered a typical point of the German defensive wall, it was hoped that an accurate picture would be obtained as to how they intended to repel any invasion threat. It was determined to test the landing of tanks from amphibious craft, to test the changes made in joint communications, and to obtain information concerning the results of naval gunfire and air support.  The plan called for a raid-in-force by a closely coordinated joint attack of air, sea, and land forces. Planners anticipated that the joint operation would take only 15 hours for successful execution and withdrawal. The raid was originally conceived by Mountbatten and his Combined Operations Staff, and that they visualized it as a British undertaking. The troops to be used would be Commandos and other British who had been given special amphibious training.

There are numerous myths and legends surrounding marine mammals. The Greeks believed that killing a dolphin was as bad as murdering a human. An Amazon legend said that river dolphins came to shore dressed as men to woo pretty girls during fiestas. During the Middle Ages, there were numerous legends surrounding the narwhals' amazing tusk, which was thought to have come from the unicorn.  Marine mammals evolved from their land dwelling ancestors over time by developing adaptations to life in the water. To aid swimming, the body has become streamlined and the number of body projections has been reduced. The ears have shrunk to small holes in size and shape. Mammary glands and sex organs are not part of the external physiology, and posterior (hind) limbs are no longer present.  Mechanisms to prevent heat loss have also been developed. The cylindrical body shape with small appendages reduces the surface area to volume ratio of the body, which reduces heat loss. Marine mammals also have a counter current heat exchange mechanism created by convergent evolution where the heat from the arteries is transferred to the veins as they pass each other before getting to extremities, thus reducing heat loss. Some marine mammals also have a thick layer of fur with a water repellent undercoat and/or a thick layer of blubber that can't be compressed. The blubber provides insulation, a food reserve, and aids with buoyancy. These heat loss adaptations can also lead to overheating for animals that spend time out of the water. To prevent overheating, seals or sea lions will swim close to the surface with their front flippers waving in the air. They also flick sand onto themselves to keep the sun from directly hitting their skin. Blood vessels can also be expanded to act as a sort of radiator.  One of the major behavioral adaptations of marine mammals is their ability to swim and dive. Pinnipeds swim by paddling their flippers while sirenians and cetaceans move their tails or flukes up and down.  Some marine mammals can swim at relatively high speeds. Sea lions swim up to 35 kph and orcas can reach 50 kph . The fastest marine mammal, however, is the common dolphin , which reaches speeds up to 64 kph . While swimming, these animals take very quick breaths. For example, fin whales can empty and refill their huge lungs in less than 2 seconds. During dives marine mammals' larynx and esophagus close automatically when they open their mouths to catch prey. Oxygen is stored in hemoglobin in the blood and in myoglobin in the muscles. The lungs are also collapsible so that air is pushed into the windpipe preventing excess nitrogen from being absorbed into the tissues. Decreasing pressure can cause excess nitrogen to expand in the tissues as animals ascend to shallower depths, which can lead to decompression sickness aka “the bends.” Bradycardia, the reduction of heart rate by 10 to 20%, also takes place to aid with slowing respiration during dives and the blood flow to non-essential body parts. These adaptations allow sea otters to stay submerged for 4 to 5 minutes and dive to depths up to 55 m . Pinnipeds can often stay down for 30 minutes and reach average depths of 150- 250 m . One marine mammal with exceptional diving skills is the Weddell seal , which can stay submerged for at least 73 minutes at a time at depths up to 600 m . The length and depth of whale dives depends on the species. Baleen whales feed on plankton near the surface of the water and have no need to dive deeply so they are rarely seen diving deeper than 100 m . Toothed whales seek larger prey at deeper depths and some can stay down for hours at depths of up to 2,250 m .  Marine mammals are often very social animals. Dolphins travel in pods (schools) and catch rides on the bow waves of boats.

In contrast to his outrageous, rebarbative characterisations, Mayall was quietly-spoken and shy, with a reputation as the chameleon comedian: “fluent, funny, polite, informed” noted one of the comparatively few interviewers he spoke to, but “also evasive, slippery, canny, cautious and a tad self-congratulatory”.  “There’s a quality about me,” Mayall himself once confessed, “that you don’t quite trust”.  Although he became a defining part of the television landscape of the 1980s — including a memorable turn as the rumbustiously randy Squadron Commander Flashheart in Blackadder Goes Forth (“Always treat your kite like you treat your woman ... get inside her five times a day and take her to heaven and back!”) — Mayall always preferred working in the live theatre. His fellow comic actor Simon Fanshawe ascribed to Mayall “a kind of pure energy as a solo performer on stage that, if you are prepared for the ride, is irresistible”.  In April 1998, when he was 40, a near-fatal accident on a quad bike left Mayall in a coma for five days; severe head injuries caused impaired memory, shaky co-ordination and speech problems. “The accident was over Easter and as you know, Jesus our Lord was nailed to the cross on Good Friday,” recounted Mayall in an interview last year. “The day before that is Crap Thursday, and that’s the day Rik Mayall died. And then he was dead on Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday until Bank Holiday Monday.”  But he appeared to have made a complete recovery, and returned to work in blustering form as Richie Twat (pronounced Thwaite) in Guesthouse Paradiso (1999), a film he co-wrote with his friend and long-time comedy partner Adrian Edmondson.  Although his part as Peeves the poltergeist in the first Harry Potter film failed to make the final cut, Mayall remained philosophical. “I’ve looked over the edge,” he remarked, adding that his brush with death had taught him that ending up on the cutting room floor hardly seemed so bad.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.

By Christopher Crockett in Space | November 8, 2012  Black holes are the remnants of very massive stars with gravity so strong that not even light can escape.  Black holes may be among the strangest – and most commonly misunderstood – objects in our universe. The remnants of the most massive stars, they sit at the limit of our understanding of physics. They can contain several times the mass of our sun in a space no larger than a city.  With gravity so intense that not even light can escape their surfaces, black holes can teach us about the absolute extremes in the cosmos and the very structure of space itself.  Artist’s rendition of a black hole drawing gas off a nearby star. Credit: NASA E/PO, Sonoma State University, Aurore Simonnet  Conceptually, black holes aren’t all that complicated. They are nothing more than extremely dense cores of once-massive stars. Most stars, like our sun, end their lives peacefully by gently blowing their outer layers into space. But stars exceeding about eight times the mass of the sun take another, more dramatic, path.  These stars die when they can no longer fuse atomic nuclei in their core. It’s not that they run out of fuel, per se. Rather, once the star has a core of iron, fusing together atoms to make new elements actually costs the star energy. Lacking an energy source, the star can’t hold itself up against the relentless struggle with gravity. The outer layers of the star come crashing down.  As several octillion tons of gas come hurdling down, the star’s core undergoes a drastic change and becomes resilient to further compression. The infalling gas hits the now-hardened core and rebounds. The rapid gas compression sets off one last wave of uncontrolled nuclear fusion. The star, now wildly out of balance, explodes. The resulting supernova can outshine an entire galaxy and can be seen from across the universe.  A supernova remnant, N49, located 160,000 light-years away in the Large Magellenic Cloud—a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. At roughly 5000 years old, the supernova most likely left behind a compact neutron star in its wake. This composite image shows x-rays (purple), infrared (red) and visible (white, yellow) light.  X-ray: NASA/CXC/Caltech/S.Kulkarni et al.; Optical: NASA/STScI/UIUC/Y.H.Chu & R.Williams et al.; IR: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R.Gehrz et al.  In the supernova’s wake, the core remains. This dense soup of subatomic particles has a couple of options at this point. For a star with less mass than 20 suns, the core holds together as a neutron star. But for the real stellar heavyweights, the core transforms into a truly exotic object. A black hole is born.  Stars thrive in a precarious balance. Gravity wants to pull the star together, internal pressure wants to tear it apart. The most drastic changes happen when one of these forces gets the upper hand. Above a core mass of a few suns, there is no known source of pressure that can balance gravity. The stellar remnant collapses upon itself.  Squeezing all that mass into a smaller and smaller volume makes the gravity at the dead star’s surface skyrocket. Ratcheting up the gravity makes it increasingly difficult for anything to escape. Get the gravity high enough – about 30 thousand times what we feel here on Earth – and some truly bizarre side effects pop up.  This computer simulation shows a star being gravitationally torn apart by a nearby black hole.  Long streams of superheated gas mark out the star’s final journey.

But it is important. Just as Cicero went through a phase where he used to begin every speech to the senate with the line "Carthage must be destroyed", so I have to say, far more often than I would like: Radio 4\'s comedy output needs a really big overhaul.  There are programmes that ring their own leper-bells, so you know you can avoid them. An all too typical example is Laura Solon: Talking and Not Talking, which goes out at 11.30pm on Wednesdays. The description given on the BBC\'s iPlayer includes the words "packed with bittersweet character monologues and cuttingly modern sketches", which is another way, as even the most cursorily experienced listener will recognise, of saying "not very funny". It illustrates the inverse formula given by Tolstoy about happy and unhappy families: all funny radio sketch shows are funny in different ways, but all unfunny ones are unfunny in the same way. I mean, how many different ways are there of being unfunny?  With marginally more potential, but not much more success, is DoubleScience (Wednesdays, 6.30pm), "a sitcom about two incompetent science teachers who work at a college that specialises in drama". "Incompetent" could fit the bill, in that one of the science teachers concerned, looking at a new poster of the periodic table, observes that radon sounds like something you\'d put in your washing machine. But never mind the marginal desirability of putting this weak joke in the script at all, how likely is it that a science teacher, however incompetent, would say such a thing?  Here is the sport the show makes about the teachers: they like real ale; they play Dungeons and Dragons; they are unsuccessful with women; they have undesirable living quarters; and they speak in comedy voices, one a bit like Neil from The Young Ones and the other like John Major. There is, for good measure, the proprietor of an Indian restaurant who addresses his clientele as "gentlemens".  By fluke rather than by design, my children and I have listened to the last two of these shows. Last week, the eldest, who until then had been in quite a sunny mood, suddenly lost all her joie de vivre and said, "Is this the one that\'s supposed to be funny but isn\'t?" "Let\'s give it a chance," I said. Thirty laugh-free minutes later, the children were looking defeated and mistrustful.  Also conceptually problematic is The Unbelievable Truth which, thanks to presenter David Mitchell and the calibre of many of the guests (Graeme Garden, Tony Hawks), cannot fail to raise a laugh from time to time; but the very format of the show, which is too boring to write out, means that contestants are too busy paying attention to the others\' flights of fancy to fabricate jokes. Its format is also a regression from the principles of I\'m Sorry, I Haven\'t a Clue, which was billed, you will recall, as "the antidote to panel games".

It is dynastically sort of a continuation to Cenél nGabráin of Dál Riata, "race of Fergus", as "house" an originally Celtic concept to express one of the two rivalling leader clans of early medieval Scotland, whose founding father is king Fergus Mor of Dalriada. This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cenél nGabráin were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld.  Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cenél Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc.  Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan\'s son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.

The royal Stewart line was founded by Robert II, and they were Kings and Queens of Scots from the late 14th century through the union with England in 1707.  Mary I, Queen of Scots was brought up in France, where she adopted the French spelling of the name, Stuart.  Her son, James VI of Scotland, inherited the thrones of England and Ireland upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603.  Except for the period of the Commonwealth, 1649-1660, the Stuarts were monarchs of England, Scotland and Ireland until 1707; then of Great Britain and Ireland, to the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. James VI of Scotland then inherited the realms of Elizabeth I of England, becoming James\xa0I of England and Ireland in the Union of the Crowns. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688, two Stuart queens ruled the isles: Mary II and Anne. Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife.  Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who would brought up a Roman Catholic and would precede his half-sisters; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters.  But neither had any children who survived to adulthood, so under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704, the crown passed to the House of Hanover on the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, to the midpoint of the Early modern period. Monarchs such as James IV were known for sponsoring exponents of the Northern Renaissance such as the poet Robert Henryson, and others.

Kamprad displayed entrepreneurial skills as a boy when he began selling matches to neighbours. In 1943, at age 17, he founded a company called IKEA, the name of which was based on his own initials and on the first letters of the farm (Elmtaryd) and the village (Agunnaryd) where he grew up. He initially sold such items as picture frames, jewelry, and nylon stockings over the telephone; as the business grew, he started distributing catalogs. In 1948 Kamprad began selling inexpensive furniture, and the new merchandise proved to be so popular that in 1951 IKEA began to offer only home furnishings. Two years later he opened a showroom in Almhult, Sweden. IKEA’s low prices angered competitors, and they pressured Swedish suppliers to boycott the company. Kamprad responded by having IKEA design its own merchandise and by contracting with foreign businesses for materials.  In 1956 Kamprad introduced to IKEA’s inventory flat-boxed furniture that was designed to be assembled at home. This proved to be the company’s breakthrough. The new items decreased shipping and labour costs dramatically and allowed customers to easily transport the merchandise home. The compact size of the packaged merchandise also meant that items could be stocked at the sales location instead of in a warehouse, and in 1958 the first IKEA retail outlet opened. IKEA stores followed, first in several countries in western Europe and later in other regions. Over the next 50 years, nearly 300 IKEA stores opened around the world. The distinctive stores—each one highlighted by a vibrant blue and yellow roof—typically had more than 80,000 items in stock and also featured children’s play areas and Swedish restaurants.  In 2000 IKEA began selling merchandise on the Internet, and the company expanded rapidly. By 2003 it was so popular that its catalog had the world’s largest annual print run, and by 2009 the catalog was being issued in more than two dozen languages. IKEA’s phenomenal success made Kamprad one of the richest men in the world in the early 21st century. He wrote (with Bertil Torekull) Historien om IKEA (1998; Leading by Design: The IKEA Story). The book included autobiographical information about Kamprad, notably his involvement with Nazi and fascist groups in the 1940s, for which he publicly apologized.

Photo: IKEA  Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA  Swede Ingvar Kamprad began with two empty hands to become one of the richest people in the world – as the founding\xa0owner of furniture chain store IKEA. Here’s his story, from farm life to flat-packs.  Rural childhood  Ingvar Feodor Kamprad was born on 30 March\xa01926, on a small farm called Elmtaryd near the village of Agunnaryd, in the Swedish province of Småland. To most present-day Swedes, the date and the names, in a famously rural region, resound of harsher times, when Sweden was agrarian and poor. They speak of hard work, frugality and egalitarianism rooted in shared poverty – values which would eventually enter the IKEA ethos.  Humble beginnings  Kamprad began his career at the age of six, selling matches. When just ten, he criss-crossed the neighbourhood on his bicycle, selling Christmas decorations, fish and pencils.  At 17, in 1943, Kamprad’s father rewarded him with a small sum of money for doing well in school, despite being dyslexic. With it, Ingvar founded a business named IKEA, an abbreviation for Ingvar Kamprad from Elmtaryd, Agunnaryd, his boyhood home.  Shaping IKEA’s flat-pack concept  Two years after starting IKEA, Kamprad began using milk trucks to deliver his goods. In 1947, he started selling furniture made by local manufacturers.

Shooting the Moon is a special strategy in which a player tries to take all 13 Hearts and the Queen of Spades.

He’s volunteered his strategy for shooting the moon in Hearts in hopes it’ll help many more of you with your Hearts badges for months and years to come.  Note: you can also follow these instructions by double-browsing instead of playing with a friend.  How to Shoot the Moon in Pogo Hearts  Here is a strategy guide in helping to “Shoot the Moon” in Hearts. This method is played with a friend sat opposite you.  These instructions are not a guarantee but this strategy will help you shoot the moon, if you and your friend are lucky enough to be dealt hands that can support you taking all of the hearts and the Queen of Spades.  Make sure to have your table set to the options below. Also have it set to private so you are not disturbed.  Basic table set-up:  Advanced options:  To begin with you will need to pass 3 cards to the person sat opposite you.  Ideally you should work together and have them pass the highest hearts they have – this can include the Queen of Spades.  For this method to work, you will need to have or be passed the Ace of Hearts, plus either the King or Queen of Hearts. Also having 1 or 2 of the Ace, King or Queen of Spades would be an advantage.  Try to have between 5 – 7 heart cards after the initial pass. If you have anything lower than that, exit and restart. This will ensure you have the maximum possibility of shooting the moon.  Your cards should mainly be highly ranked cards, this will make it easier to keep control of the game.  The player who has the 2 of clubs plays first – play continues clockwise. Try and trump the highest card to take control of the next hand. Play the higher ranked clubs and diamonds to gain control.  Next pass the player opposite you the lower ranked cards – ones in the Clubs and Diamond suits as these will not help you take control of the hands.  If you have the Queen of Spades, play this next. (The robots will not play the King of Spades as the idea of the game is to take the lowest amount of points). This will give you 13 points.  If you don’t have the Queen of Spades, play either the King or Ace of Spades – either robot will play the Queen of Spades, so you will end up taking the 13 points.  Avoid playing the lower hearts once the Queen of Spades is played (broken), as the robots will try to take the tricks to avoid you shooting the moon.  Start with the Ace of Hearts, but make sure the King of Hearts is played – if you don’t already have it. Ideally you need to “flush” out the higher hearts from the robots.  Then play the Queen of Hearts, Jack etc. It should ideally only take 4 or 5 hands to have taken all of the hearts. Once all hearts have been played you will have 26 points.  Keep count!

Since then, the Illinois locations composing this phantom locale have taken on a cinematic life of their own (much to the envy of real life towns looking to profit from film tourism). Yet before there was a Shermer High, there was Glenbrook North High School on Shermer Road in Northbrook.  Not only did it appear in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off , but it was also the old alma mater of John Hughes himself. The famously media-shy Hughes mentioned this fact offhandedly – when Sloane walks toward Shermer (Glenbrook) High’s front steps to meet Bueller (in disguise) – during his commentary for the film’s 1999 DVD release. Though it was at Glenbrook North that Hughes accrued the pivotal experiences which built up Shermer High School in his mind, in Weird Science it’s Niles East High School in Skokie where two Shermer students suffer the torments which drive them to create their own dream girl.  That film’s last scene introduces Shermer High’s newest supermodel gym teacher, and the jaw-dropping reaction from her students. Yet the most memorable interior section of Shermer High may be its library. The main setting for the Breakfast Club , where five students spend a Saturday in detention, was actually the gymnasium of Maine North High School in Des Plaines. Now, much has been made of Shermer students actually showing up for Saturday detention, the rarity of average-looking women on campus and the lack of a dependable opiate connection – or as Dogma drug dealer, Jay describes it: “all the honeys are top shelf, but all the dudes are whiny pussies… except for Judd Nelson. He was fucking harsh. But best of all, there was no one dealing.”  One reason for this might be found in the effect a simple glimpse of panties has on a group of male students gathered within the Shermer High men’s room in Sixteen Candles . I mean, just look at their faces. They’re obviously thinking, “who the hell needs to smoke weed, when you’ve got yourself a sweet pair of polka-dot panties?” Anyway, both Niles North and East High Schools in Skokie, as well as New Trier High School in Winnetka, are all where Samantha Baker (owner of said-panties) goes to school in this first appearance by Shermer High. And while Jay and Silent Bob journey to Shermer in order to plunder the teenage utopia, the makers of the documentary, Don’t You Forget About Me trekked to Illinois in 2008 to rediscover John Hughes. The film reminds us that before his death in August, 2009,  Hughes hadn’t directed a film since 1991. Over the subsequent decade, though, his screenplays had continued to make it to the screen, including the little-seen 1998 film, Reach The Rock – a dark echo of the Shermer High films, where a young man returns home to “Shermerville” haunted by his role in the death of a friend. The setting is the more grown-up detention hall of a jail cell – with school days now long passed for the protagonist, and Shermer High but a distant memory for the viewer.  “The Breakfast Club” had detention 30 years ago today ...“The Breakfast Club” had detention 30 years ago today | WTVR.com  This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated.

The Vic-Wells Ballet changed names numerous times before becoming the Royal Ballet, one of the world\'s leading classical ballet companies. De Valois started a second ballet company in 1946 that is now located in Birmingham and called the Birmingham Royal Ballet.  In addition to her numerous administrative and teaching duties, de Valois choreographed several works, including The Rake\'s Progress (1935), The Prospect Before Us (1940) and a version of Don Quixote (1950). Her talent for launching national dance companies extended beyond Britain. She was instrumental in recommending Celia Franca for the position of founding artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada .

It was released on 16 June 1986 in the United Kingdom by Rough Trade Records and released in the United States on 23 June 1986 through Sire Records.  The album spent twenty two weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two. Across the Atlantic, it reached number 28 in Canada on the RPM 100 album chart  and number 70 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990. It has sold consistently well ever since and has received unanimous critical acclaim, with NME listing it as the greatest album of all time in 2013.   Songwriting  Guitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while the Smiths toured Britain in early 1985, working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks.  The title of the album is from the novel, "Last Exit to Brooklyn" by author Hubert Selby, Jr..  The title of the album could be a reference to the scene in Macbeth where Seyton informs the title character of his wife\'s murder ("The queen, my Lord, is dead").  The title could also refer to a scene in Cymbeline where Cornelius, the doctor, informs Cymbeline, the king, "The queen is dead."  "The Boy with the Thorn in His Side" was, according to Marr, "an effortless piece of music", and was written on tour in the spring of 1985. The song\'s lyrics refer allegorically to the band\'s experience of the music industry that failed to appreciate it. In 2003, Morrissey named this as his favourite Smiths song.   A demo of the music for "Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others" was posted by Marr through Morrissey\'s letterbox in the summer of 1985. Morrissey then completed the song by adding lyrics. Marr has stated that he "preferred the music to the lyrics".  "Frankly, Mr. Shankly", "I Know It\'s Over" and "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" were written by Morrissey and Marr in a "marathon" writing session in the late summer of 1985 at Marr\'s home in Bowdon, Greater Manchester. The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis, head of the Smiths\' record label Rough Trade. Travis has since described it as "a funny lyric" about "Morrissey\'s desire to be somewhere else", acknowledging that a line in the song about "bloody awful poetry" was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey.   "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" features lyrics drawn from "Lonely Planet Boy" by the New York Dolls. According to Marr: "When we first played it, I thought it was the best song I\'d ever heard". The guitar part of "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\' draws on the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye\'s "Hitch Hike", a song that, itself, was an inspiration for the Velvet Underground\'s "There She Goes Again".   The music for "Never Had No One Ever", completed in August 1985, was based on a demo which Marr had recorded in December 1984, itself based on "I Need Somebody" by the Stooges. According to Marr: "The atmosphere of that track pretty much sums up the whole album and what it was like recording it." The lyric to the song reflects Morrissey\'s feeling unsafe and, being from an immigrant family, not at home on the streets of Manchester.   "The Boy with the Thorn in His Side", "Bigmouth Strikes Again" and "Frankly, Mr. Shankly" were debuted live during a tour of Scotland in September and October, during which "The Queen Is Dead" and "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" were soundchecked.

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future.

Its symbol is simply "Lt", that is usually after the amount e.g. "3,82 Lt" . Each litas consists of 100 centas. Coins go as little as 1 centas to 5 litas, while banknotes (bills) go as from 10 litas to 500 litas.\xa0  The litas has been pegged to euro at the rate of 3.4528 LTL= 1 EUR \xa0since February 2002. Euro being the official peg currency makes commercial banks to follow Lithuanian Central Bank mandate (www.lb.lt) to not exceed 0.50 percent margin in commercial transactions. Lithuania has had hopes to join the EU monetary union in 2007 so the Euro would become the currency. SEB/Vilniaus Bankas (www.seb.lt) now claims no worries about converting to Euro and puts the best forecast for 2009. Thus among notable rates of exchange, it is roughly 4 litas to the pound sterling (2011). There is limited possibity to buy Litas outside of Lithuania so you have two main ways to get your spending money:  1. Take your own local currency and change it when you arrive. Go to a bank and you will find that the cashiers will exchange your money without the need for you to enter into any explanation. Just hand over the money and back will come the Lita. Some banks have a little machine inside the door with symbols on so that you just press the \'currency exchange\' button, receive a ticket with a number on and then wait for your turn.  2. The second way to obtain some spending money is take your bank card card to an cash machines (ATM) - be it Visa, Mastercard or any plain debit card bearring Cirrus logo. The machines will offer you a choice of languages when you insert your card. Select the appropriate one and then proceed as you would at home.

Deer can be found around the world. They are native to all continents except for Australia and Antarctica. There are about 100 types of deer, including the whitetail deer, reindeer, elk, moose, mule deer, blacktail deer and caribou.  Male deer are called bucks, bulls, stags or harts. Female deer are called does, cows or hinds. Young deer are called fawns or calfs.  Deer can adapt well to just about any habitat. They prefer to live in "edge" habitats. Edges are human-made or natural habitat breaks, for instance from woods to croplands. They will use the woodlands for cover and shelter and the open land to graze in. In northern latitudes, deer may live in different areas in the summer and winter months. These areas can be as far as 30 miles apart.  Deer are the only animals that have antlers. They are the fastest growing living tissue on earth. Antlers are usually only found on males. In some species, like caribou, you will also find them on females. Moose have the largest antlers. Antlers grow from spring until fall. While growing, antlers are covered with a soft tissue known as velvet. This tissue contains a network of nerves and blood vessels and is very sensitive. In the fall, the velvet is shed and the antlers harden. In the winter, the antlers are shed. Antlers should not be confused with horns. Horns are never shed and continue to grow throughout the animal\'s life. If they are broken, they won\'t grow back.  Deer have a great sense of hearing. They have a lot of muscles attached to their ears which allow them to turn their ears in any direction, without moving their heads. They can hear higher frequencies of sound than humans.  The brown coat of the deer provides great camouflage in the woodlands. By standing still, they can go undetected by a passing predator. Fawns have a reddish-brown color covered with white spots, which help camouflage them and disappear when they are 3-4 months old. In the fall, deer will shed their summer coat and receive a much thicker winter coat.  Deer have their eyes on the sides of their head, giving them a 310 degree view. This wide view does make it hard for deer to focus on a single point. Deer have a good night vision, which is useful in the early morning and near dusk.  Deer have small teeth in the front of the bottom jaw, which they use for tearing and breaking apart food. They have no teeth in the front of the top jaw. Instead they have a hard palate, which is used in much the same way as teeth. In the back of the mouth deer have molars, canines and incisors, which are used for chewing.  Deer are ungulates, which means that they have two-toed hoofs. They have long legs with powerful muscles and are able to run 40 miles per hour and jump 10 feet high. They are also fast swimmers.  Deer have an excellent sense of smell, which allows them to detect predators from a long distance away. Deer lick their nose to keep it moist, which helps odor particles stick to it, improving their sense of smell. The nose also plays a role in communication. Deer produce scents with glands located on their head, legs and hooves. These scents provide information to other deer about their gender, social status, physical condition and whether an area is safe.  Deer usually stay in the same area called a home range. These areas are shared by related females who form matriarchies and that exclude adult males.  The breeding season for deer occurs between October and January. This period is called the "rut". During the "rut" the necks of the male deer will swell to more than double their normal diameter and their antlers will have lost their velvet.

In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent). Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history. Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation. | Question: What percentage of the population of Warsaw was Jewish in 1897?", ['34', '34%', 'around 34%'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-683'), ("Context: The Marx Brothers | Jewish Virtual LibraryThe Marx Brothers | Jewish Virtual Library  • Gummo- Milton, 1892-1977  • Zeppo- Herbert, 1901-1979  All of the boys were encouraged from an early age                                      to play musical instruments. Harpo’s main musical focus was the                                      harp (from which he derived his nickname), Chico was an excellent pianist,                                      and Groucho played the guitar. In 1905, Groucho made his debut as a                                      singer in vaudeville. By 1907 he and Gummo were singing together as                                      part of The Three Nighingales with Mabel O’Donnell. The next year,                                      Harpo became the fourth Nightingale. By 1910, the group expanded to                                      include their mother, Minnie, and their Aunt Hannah; the troupe was                                      renamed The Six Mascots.  Slowly, the group’s act evolved from singing                                      to a comedy with some music. By 1912, Chico had joined the group. Nevertheless,                                      around this time, Gummo left the group to fight in World War I; Zeppo                                      would replace him for their final vaudeville years.  During World War I, the brothers changed their stage                                      name to “The Four Marx Brothers” (including Chico, Harpo,                                      Groucho, and Zeppo). By 1919, they were playing the most famous venue                                      in vaudeville, the Palace Theatre in New York City. They also began                                      to develop their famous on-stage personas. Groucho began to wear his trademark greasepaint moustache and to use a stooped walk, Harpo began                                      to wear a red fright wig, carried a taxi-cab horn and never spoke, Chico                                      started to talk in a fake Italian accent, and Zeppo adopted the schleppy,                                      juvenile role of the straight man.  The Marx Brothers made their next claim to fame, by                                      becoming successful stars on Broadway. Their first musical revue, I’ll                                        Say She Is, debuted in 1924. A year later they followed up with                                      the musical comedy, The Cocoanuts and then in 1928 with Animal                                        Crackers.  The brothers next struck a contract with Paramount                                      Pictures and embarked on their career in films. Their first two films                                      were adaptation of their former Broadway shows: The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930). In 1931, they made a short                                      film, The House That Shadows Built, which was included in Paramount’s                                      twentieth anniversary documentary. In 1932, the brothers filmed Horse                                        Feathers, their most popular film to date, and the film which won                                      them the cover of Time magazine. Their last Paramount film, Duck                                        Soup (1933), is the only Marx Brothers film on the American Film                                      Institute’s “100 years… 100 Movies” list. The                                      team left Paramount due to creative disagreements and financial issues.  The Marx Brothers in action  After                                      Zeppo left the act to become an agent, the three remaining brothers                                      moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Under the leadership of Irving Thalberg,                                      the team changed their formula; stronger plots, more musical numbers,                                      and using the brothers' characters as comic foils to serious romance.                                      The first film that the Marx Brothers shot with MGM was A Night at                                        the Opera (1935); the film was a great success, and for many years                                      considered their best work. It was followed two years later by the even                                      bigger hit A Day at the Races (1937). The Marx Brothers made                                      three more films before leaving MGM, At the Circus (1939), Go                                        West (1940), and The Big Store (1941).  Although the brothers seemed ready to retire, Chico                                      was in dire financial straits and to help settle his gambling debts,                                      the group made another two films, A Night in Casablanca (1946)                                      and Love Happy (1949), both of them released by United Artists.                                      In 1959, they did a television special, The Incredible Jewel Robbery.  Chico and Harpo went on to make nightclub and casino                                      appearances, sometimes together.

So named after American Indian tribes, Indiana was once filled with Algonquin-speaking Miami\xa0and Iroquois\xa0confederations. They first encountered the Sieur de la Salle, who through his French fur empire created the first white settlement west of the Appalachians.

The History Learning Site , 5 Mar 2015. 20 Oct 2016.  Medieval England experienced few revolts but the most serious was the Peasants’ Revolt which took place in June 1381. A violent system of punishments for offenders was usually enough to put off peasants from causing trouble. Most areas in England also had castles in which soldiers were garrisoned, and these were usually enough to guarantee reasonable behaviour among medieval peasants.  An army of peasants from Kent and Essex marched on London. They did something no-one had done before or since – they captured the Tower of London. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the King’s Treasurer were killed. The king, Richard II, was only 14 at the time but despite his youth, he agreed to meet the peasants at a place called Mile End.  What were the peasants angry about and why had they come to London ?  1. After the Black Death , many manors were left short of workers. To encourage those who had survived to stay on their manor, many lords had given the peasants on their estates their freedom and paid them to work on their land. Now, nearly 35 years after the Black Death, many peasants feared that the lords would take back these privileges and they were prepared to fight for them.  2. Many peasants had to work for free on church land, sometimes up to two days in the week. This meant that they could not work on their own land which made it difficult to grow enough food for their families. Peasants wanted to be free of this burden that made the church rich but them poor. They were supported in what they wanted by a priest called John Ball from Kent.  3. There had been a long war with France. Wars cost money and that money usually came from the peasants through the taxes that they paid. In 1380, Richard II introduced a new tax called the Poll Tax. This made everyone who was on the tax register pay 5p. It was the third time in four years that such a tax had been used. By 1381, the peasants had had enough. 5p to them was a great deal of money. If they could not pay in cash, they could pay in kind, such as seeds, tools etc., anything that could be vital to survival in the coming year.  In May 1381, a tax collector arrived at the Essex village of Fobbing to find out why the people there had not paid their poll tax. He was thrown out by the villagers. In June, soldiers arrived to establish law and order. They too were thrown out as the villagers of Fobbing had now organised themselves and many other local villages in Essex had joined them. After doing this, the villagers marched on London to plead with the young king to hear their complaints.  One man had emerged as the leader of the peasants – Wat Tyler from Kent. As the peasants from Kent had marched to London, they had destroyed tax records and tax registers. The buildings which housed government records were burned down. They got into the city of London because the people there had opened the gates to them.  By mid-June the discipline of the peasants was starting to go. Many got drunk in London and looting took place. It is known that foreigners were murdered by the peasants. Wat Tyler had asked for discipline amongst those who looked up to him as their leader. He did not get it.  On June 14th, the king met the rebels at Mile End. At this meeting, Richard II gave the peasants all that they asked for and asked that they go home in peace. Some did. Others returned to the city and murdered the archbishop and Treasurer – their heads were cut off on Tower Hill by the Tower of London. Richard II spent the night in hiding in fear of his life.  On June 15th, he met the rebels again at Smithfield outside of the city’s walls. It is said that this was the idea of the Lord Mayor (Sir William | Question: Who was the leader of the Peasant's Revolt in 1381 who, after killing a poll tax collector, marched on London with supporters and was killed there at Smithfield by the Lord Mayor of London?", ['wat tyler'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2980'), ('Context: The Dingoes  The Dingoes is an Australian country rock band initially active from 1973 to 1979, formed in Melbourne which relocated to the United States from 1976.

The buzz-off for control of the board  If it wasn\'t the top answer then the opposing team were allowed to guess. Whoever had the most popular answer got to take the question for their team (they could pass it if they wanted, but that was a rare occurrence). The rest of the family then took it in turns to guess answers until they got three incorrect guesses (as represented by a cross and a UH-UHHHHH! sound).  The game board  If the opposing team then guessed an answer not yet found they won the money (a pound for every person that replied to that answer). If not, any found money went to the first team.  After the break they played for Double Money. You\'re probably intelligent enough to guess what happened there.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

I was going on memory. I looked it up, and I can only find it as a Germanic root, but it may go back to PIE as well. This is from Wikipedia:  "The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner," and as such is related to the names of several other European regions where Germanic peoples came into contact with indigenous non-Germanic cultures, including: Wallonia (Belgium), Valais (Switzerland), and Wallachia (Romania), as well as the "-wall" of Cornwall and even the "wal-" in the walnut tree. However, it has also been suggested that the prefix "Wall" acknowledges a people who had contact with the Roman empire (see Vlach)."  Damian in Edinburgh \xa0 Tue Nov 06, 2007 9:18 am GMT  ***"The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner,"***  Ironically is indeed the operative word here.   As far as the English, particularly, are concerned, the Welsh people have always been considered more "foreign" than have the other constituent member races of the entire British Isles, including what is now the people of the Republic of Ireland, who, technically, are really foreigners.   Certainly we Scots have not been seen in quite the same light by the English as have the Welsh people as an entity.  I think that several factors are involved in this English perception of the Welsh as being "more foreign" - one being, of course, the survival of the Welsh Language, a Language seen as quite alien to English itself in so many ways.    There are characteristics of Welsh that are more similar to some Continental Languages than there are to English.   Bearing in mind the nature of the Welsh Language, you then have to consider the physical closeness of Wales to the main body of England geographically - ie the Midlands and Southern England generally, the areas most seen as the political powerhouse of England politically and culturally.  Here in Scotland we are considerably further away in distance from much of England (including London and the Home Counties) yet we are not seen as being as "foreign" as the Welsh as we do not have the "advantage" of a separate Language like they have.  Many English people feel a real sense of "difference" when crossing the border out of England and into Wales which they don\'t quite feel when driving out of England into Scotland.   I think that is entirely due to the sudden change from Anglo Saxon place names in England to the "foreign" looking Welsh place names in Wales - not to mention the fact that all road signs immediately become bi-lingual, including road markings ie "Araf" "meaning "Slow" painted on the road surfaces.  Each time I\'ve driven over the English/Welsh border (four times now) I noticed that at first the English word took precedence above the Welsh word, but the further into Wales you go - ie further into the strongholds of the still surviving (and flourishing) Welsh Language the Welsh word takes precedence.  This simply doesn\'t happen when travelling back and forth over the Scottish / English border which I have done countless numbers of times - if I had a quid for each time I\'ve crossed the border I\'d have a bloody good holiday on one of the Greek islands....or take a cruise down the Nile..I\'d love to go and take a peek at the newly resurrected King Tut.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. | Question: The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?', ['distinction'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10042'), ('Context: PPG Paints Arena , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ( Host : Duquesne University )   Intrust Bank Arena , Wichita , Kansas ( Host : Wichita State University )   American Airlines Center , Dallas , Texas ( Host : Big 12 Conference )   Taco Bell Arena , Boise , Idaho ( Host : Boise State University ) | Question: where will the first round of march madness be played ?', ['Wichita State University', 'Boise State University', 'Duquesne University', 'Big 12 Conference'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-3058'), ("Context: Ewan McGregor as Obi - Wan Kenobi : A Jedi Master and mentor of Anakin Skywalker .

Semenya won gold in the women\'s 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final. Semenya also won silver medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics, both in the 800 metres.  Following her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. She was withdrawn from international competition until 6 July 2010 when the IAAF cleared her to return to competition.  In 2010, the British magazine New Statesman included Semenya in a list of "50 People That Matter 2010".   Early life and education  Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in South Africa near Polokwane (back then called Pietersburg), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, "deep in South Africa\'s northern Limpopo province." She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a tomboy as a child.   Semenya attended Nthema Secondary School and now attends the University of Pretoria as a sports science student.   She began running as training for soccer.   Career  2008  In July Semenya participated in the 2008 World Junior Championships, and won the gold in the 800 m at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a time of 2:04.23.   2009  In the African Junior Championships Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.    With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone. The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date. It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by Zelda Pretorius at 1:58.85, and Zola Budd at 2:00.90, respectively.   The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says it was "obliged to investigate" after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m\xa0– "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use."  The IAAF also asked Semenya to undergo a gender test after the win. News that the IAAF requested the test broke three hours before the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions."   In August Semenya won gold in the 800 metres at the World Championships with a time of 1:55.45 in the final, again setting the fastest time of the year.   Gender test  Following her victory at the world championships, questions were raised about her gender.    The IAAF\'s handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticized the organization for its response to the incident.  Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as racist, as well as an affront to Semenya\'s privacy and human rights.   The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted."  The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a "rare medical condition" giving her an unfair competitive advantage. The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.  In an interview with South African magazine YOU Semenya stated, "God made me the way I am and I accept myself." She also took part in a makeover with the magazine.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy. And while his team mate Fangio also won three races, for the fiercely proud Farina his being crowned World Champion only officially confirmed what he considered to be | Question: Nino Farina was the first world champion of what?", ['formula one championship', 'formula one world championship', 'formula 1', 'formula one'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1521')]

In 1542, while just six days old, Mary ascended to the Scottish throne upon the death of her father, King James V. Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis’ death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the country’s monarch.  In 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeth’s death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o’ Field, and Mary’s lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.  In 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.  On February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother’s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Who was Mary Queen of Scots?  Mary was known as Queen of Scots because she was Queen of Scotland. For a short time she was also Queen of France. She might have become Queen of England too. Mary's life was full of romance but sadness too. She became famous across Europe, especially after her execution in 1587, for plotting (it was said) against England's Queen Elizabeth I.  When did she live?  Mary was born in 1542, when Henry VIII was King of England. Her father was King James V of Scotland. Mary became Queen of Scotland as a baby. She was Queen until 1567, when she gave up the crown and left Scotland. She spent many years a prisoner in England, where she was put to death on 8 February 1587.  A sad life  Mary never knew her father, who died soon after her birth. As a little girl, she was sent away from her mother to France. Her first husband died two years after their wedding. Her second husband was murdered. Her third husband ran off with her, then deserted her. The Scots rejected her, and the English locked her up. Mary Queen of Scots' sad life ended when she was beheaded in 1587.  Princess in Scotland  Where was Mary born?  Mary was born at Linlithgow Palace in Scotland on 8 December 1542. Mary's father was King James V of Scotland. Mary's mother, Mary of Guise, was French. Mary was related to the English king, Henry VIII, through her English grandmother, a member of the Tudor family.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in "a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy"). Geneva was John Calvin\'s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the "Confederate Party", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.

St. Michael is the  patron saint of the sea and maritime lands, of ships and boatmen, of horses and horsemen. He was the Angel who hurled Lucifer (the devil) down from Heaven for his treachery.  Michaelmas Day is traditionally the last day of the harvest season.  The harvest season used to begin on 1 August and was called Lammas , meaning 'loaf Mass'. Farmers made loaves of bread from the new wheat crop and gave them to their local                church. The custom ended when Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church, and nowadays we have harvest festivals at the end of the season near Michaelmas Day.  Curfew  Michaelmas used to be a popular day for the winter night curfew to begin - the first hint that winter was on the way. Curfew took the form of a tolling of the church bell, usually one strike for each of the days of the month that had passed in the current year and generally rung at 9pm.  The word curfew may derive from the French word couvre feu, meaning 'cover fire'. Curfew was the time when household fires were supposed to be doused. The bell was tolled every night, apart from Sunday, until Shrove Tuesday .  Chertsey is one of the last places to still ring a Curfew bell at 8pm from Michaelmas Day to Lady Day (29th September to 25th March). Their oldest Curfew bell dates from 1380!  Goose Day  Michaelmas Day is sometimes also called Goose Day. Goose Fairs are still held in some English towns, but geese are no longer sold.                A famous Michaelmas fair is the Nottingham Goose Fair which is now held on or around  3 October.  A Great custom in England was to dine on goose on Michaelmas. One reason for this was said to be that Queen Elizabeth I was eating goose when news of the defeat of the Armada was brought to her. In celebration she said that henceforth she would always eat goose on Michaelmas Day. Others then followed her lead.  Quarter Day  Another suggestion, why goose are eaten, is that, as Michaelmas Day  was a Quarter Day,  rents were due and bills had to be paid.\xa0Tenants seeking delay of payment traditionally bought a goose as a present for their landlord to help seek his indulgence. Geese were supposedly very tasty at this time of year.  Labourers for hire  On the day after Michaelmas, every year agricultural labourers presented themselves, along with their tools, at the nearest market town. There they offered themselves for hire for the coming year. A fair followed the hirings and this was called ' Mop Fair '.

They are spaced three months apart, on religious festivals, usually close to the solstices or equinoxes. They were the four dates on which servants were hired, rents due or leases begun. It used to be said that harvest had to be completed by Michaelmas, almost like the marking of the end of the productive season and the beginning of the new cycle of farming.

Well to start with a Cordwainer is not 'just' a shoemaker and he certainly not a cobler. Consider the difference between a fast food hamburger fry cook, a every day eatery 'cook' and a 'chef'. A 'Chef' is certainly NOT a hamburger fry cook, and he is not 'just' a cook. A 'Chef' is at the level of his profession as is a 'Cordwainer' is in his profession. A rough example is that a rough  shoemaker would make you a pair of shoes and how you wore them would make  them into being a left and a right shoe. A good shoemaker would be able to make you a left and right shoe. But a Cordwainer would make you a really fine fitting individually made pair of shoes out of the finest leather made exactly to fit  your left foot and your right foot.  The use of the finest leathers and the production of fhe finest luxury shoes and boots are the Cordwainer's profession. Note the 'Cordwainer' name embosed in the heal sole of this pair of, $437, handmade shoes at the right. Too expensive for my wallet so like many I was unfamiliar with the name and profession until it was so clearly written in John Hender's will that I could not ignore it while transcribing his will and I had to look it up on the internet to find out what it was. At least I didn't do what some other scribe or transcriber did from or on one of John's children's, Henry's, marriage record, where Cordwainer was made into 'Corn Dealer'.  Traditionally, if not also historically, the professional Cordwainer is said to have made the finest luxury shoes and boots from the finest of Spanish cordovan leather. Though listed as 'archaic, the term, name and title of Cordwainer is still used by a number of traditionalist who still hand make their shoes of the finest leathers. Of the guild governed professions, that of a cordwainer was strictly set out and controled as even today there is a central London district of such and there was a school of training for the Cordwainer. Lookup 'Cordwainer District or Ward London'.  An interesting aside to being able to buy 'ready sized' shoes over the internet with the name of Cordwainer enscribe in the sole of the shoe, is that one of the more traditional features of the Cordwainer profession was to make 'custom shoe' which were 'custom fit'. So if one foot was slightly or even more particularly greatly different from the other your Cordwainer made shoes would fit for the true Cordwainer would personally fit each shoe to each foot and make the two shoes of the pair differntly accordingly. So much for my $437 pair of Cordwainer shoes.  Today, many deffinitions made of a cordwainer and shoemaker one and the same thing. And thus we are back to all chef are cooks but not all cooks are chefs. When speaking of Cobblers and Shoemakers one site states something like this:  'Many peole think that a shoemaker and a cobbler are one and the same. This is NOT so. Shoemakers work only with 'new leather' to make 'new shoes'. A Cobbler works with 'old leather' to repair and sometines 'rebuild' and even re-cut the old shoe's leather to make a totally different shoe. But the cobbler is still working with old materials. While today that distinction seems to be somewhat arbitray, technically and professionally speaking, a shoemaker and a cobbler are separate and have their own 'guild'.  But then that same site goes on to make a 'Shoemaker' the same as a 'Cordwainer'. Talk about missing the point. Leather is of various qualities. The making of ordinary every day shoes out of common but 'new' leather IS NOT the same as making a 'luxury shoe' out of the highest quality and finest leathers, and custom made 'to boot', pun intended.

Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run.

Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites.

However, it has also been suggested that the prefix "Wall" acknowledges a people who had contact with the Roman empire (see Vlach)."  Damian in Edinburgh \xa0 Tue Nov 06, 2007 9:18 am GMT  ***"The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner,"***  Ironically is indeed the operative word here.   As far as the English, particularly, are concerned, the Welsh people have always been considered more "foreign" than have the other constituent member races of the entire British Isles, including what is now the people of the Republic of Ireland, who, technically, are really foreigners.   Certainly we Scots have not been seen in quite the same light by the English as have the Welsh people as an entity.  I think that several factors are involved in this English perception of the Welsh as being "more foreign" - one being, of course, the survival of the Welsh Language, a Language seen as quite alien to English itself in so many ways.    There are characteristics of Welsh that are more similar to some Continental Languages than there are to English.   Bearing in mind the nature of the Welsh Language, you then have to consider the physical closeness of Wales to the main body of England geographically - ie the Midlands and Southern England generally, the areas most seen as the political powerhouse of England politically and culturally.  Here in Scotland we are considerably further away in distance from much of England (including London and the Home Counties) yet we are not seen as being as "foreign" as the Welsh as we do not have the "advantage" of a separate Language like they have.  Many English people feel a real sense of "difference" when crossing the border out of England and into Wales which they don\'t quite feel when driving out of England into Scotland.   I think that is entirely due to the sudden change from Anglo Saxon place names in England to the "foreign" looking Welsh place names in Wales - not to mention the fact that all road signs immediately become bi-lingual, including road markings ie "Araf" "meaning "Slow" painted on the road surfaces.  Each time I\'ve driven over the English/Welsh border (four times now) I noticed that at first the English word took precedence above the Welsh word, but the further into Wales you go - ie further into the strongholds of the still surviving (and flourishing) Welsh Language the Welsh word takes precedence.  This simply doesn\'t happen when travelling back and forth over the Scottish / English border which I have done countless numbers of times - if I had a quid for each time I\'ve crossed the border I\'d have a bloody good holiday on one of the Greek islands....or take a cruise down the Nile..I\'d love to go and take a peek at the newly resurrected King Tut.

The second way to experience Egypt is from the comfort of your own home: online.  Horus, the God of Kings in Ancient Egypt  Horus, the God of Kings  by Jimmy Dunn  From the very earliest of times, the falcon seems to have been worshipped in Egypt as representative of the greatest cosmic powers. Many falcon gods existed throughout Egypt, though over time, a good number of these assimilated to Horus , the most important of the avian deities. Yet, from all his of many forms, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the "true" Horus. Horus is mostly a general term for a great number of falcon deities.  Horus is one of ancient Egypt\'s best known gods , as well as one of its oldest. His name is attested to from at least the beginning of the Dynastic Period , and depictions of falcon deities on earlier artifacts, such as the Narmer Palette, probably represent this same god. The Turin Canon, which provides some of our most important information on Egypt\'s early history, specifically describes the Predynastic rulers of Egypt as "Followers of Horus".  The use of his name was also widespread in personal names throughout Egyptian history, and Hor, as a personal name, survives into our modern era in a number                   of different forms.  Forms of Horus  Horus is a complicated deity, appearing in many different forms and his mythology is one of the most extensive of all Egyptian deities. Indeed, he has so many different aspects that we must limit our discussion to those that are significant. At the same time, a judicious examination of the various Horuses and the sources relating to them supports the possibility that the roles in question are closely interrelated, and so they may be understood as different aspects of the same divine persona.  The original form of Horus was probably that of a sky god, known as "lord of the sky". The Egyptian word " her" (hor, har), from which the god\'s name is derived means "the one on high", or "the distant one", probably in reference to the soaring flight of the hunting falcon, if not a reference to the solar aspect of the god. Mythologically, the god was imagined as a celestial falcon, whose right eye was the sun and left eye the moon. The speckled feathers of his breast were probably considered to be the stars, while his wings were the sky that created the wind. In this form, Horus was apparently worshipped at some of Egypt\'s earliest shrines such as at Nekhen (Heirakonpolis) , where he was assimilated with a number of other local falcon gods. In this capacity, Horus was the patron of the Nekhen monarchy that grew into the historical pharaonic state and hence, the first known national god.  A natural outgrowth of his role as "lord of the sky" was his aspect as a sun god. An ivory comb of the 1st Dynasty king Den depicts a falcon in a boat riding on outstretched wings, suggesting the falcon traversing the sky as the sun god. The early Pyramid Texts specifically refer to him in solar terms as "god of the east", and he  appears in at least three forms in this guise.  As Horakhty (Harakhty), or "Horus of the two horizons", Horus was the god of the rising and setting sun, but more particularly the god of the east and the sunrise. In the Pyramid Texts , the deceased king is said to be reborn in the eastern sky as Horakhty. Eventually, Horakhty became a part of the Heliopolis sun cult and was fused with its solar god as Re-Horakhty .

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."  Pub Date: 12/20/96  Prince Philip Angers Britons on Gun Control - NYTimes.comPrince Philip Angers Britons on Gun Control - The New York Times  The New York Times  World |Prince Philip Angers Britons on Gun Control  Search  Continue reading the main story  Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, spoke out in a broadcast today against pending handgun legislation, using an offhand analogy to cricket, and promptly found himself at the center of the latest round of dismay over the conduct of the British royal family.  In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.  Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become \'\'a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,\'\' the Prince said, \'\'I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.\'\' But then he added, \'\'Look, if a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which | Question: "Who famously said after the \'Dunblane Massacre\', ""If a cricketer for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats""?" ?', ['duke of edinburgh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6259'), ("Context: `` Archie Marries Veronica / Archie Marries Betty '' is an American comic book story by writer Michael Uslan and artists Stan Goldberg and Bob Smith that was originally presented in Archie # 600 -- 606 .

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

I’m sure you’re all familiar with it by now, but if not, BendGate was created from an alleged bending issue with Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. There’s a specific weak point on the inside of the chassis right beneath the volume buttons that allows it to bend very easily with pressure added in the right place. To most, it may seem like a non-issue, but a single video sparked one of the biggest viral moments this year in tech…  Lewis Hilsenteger from Unbox Therapy published the video that I’ve embedded below this article and that’s when it all got worse. In the video, Hilsenteger clearly bends an iPhone 6 Plus on camera and notes the specific weak point mentioned above. Of course, Hilsenteger (who is a friend and music collaborator ) had absolutely no idea that his video would cause the Internet to implode, but he assumed it would gain a decent amount of traction based on reports of the iPhone 6 Plus’ bendable properties that had been published earlier that day. 45 million views later, BendGate became a PR nightmare for Apple, somewhat of a conspiracy theory (which Hilsenteger debunked ), and a chance for mainstream media to show its true colors…  First off, let’s get one thing straight: The iPhone 6 Plus will bend if enough pressure is applied to a certain area. In fact, a lot of phones will bend when extreme pressure is applied. Everything has a weak point.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ('Context: In contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens.

''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

But on the other hand, it’s quite a chore to make a Cassata alla Siciliana and although Fabrizia Lanza sailed through it without breaking a sweat, between using the right pan, mixing up your own almond paste, finding ricotta as good as the ricotta in Sicily, and getting the candied fruit (including the squash, which is the translucent white brick on the platter), it might be classified as one of those things that’s better left to the Sicilians.  (Nevertheless, if you want to give it a go, Saveur printed her Cassata recipe, and it’s also in her book, Coming Home to Sicily . I linked to additional recipes at the end of the post.)  According to Italian food specialist Clifford A. Wright , the word Cassata is derived from the Arabic word quas’at, or qas’at, which refers to a wide bowl. There is actually a special pan to make the cake; it’s a mold with sloped sides and a groove around the bottom so that when Cassata mold is lined with strips of almond paste, and overturned, there’s a rim to create a neat guard against the icing from running down the sides.  I found out what the pan was for when I was making some pine nut praline for an ice cream I was going to churn up for her, made by caramelizing 1 part sugar then stirring in 1 part lightly toasted pine nuts, which get spread on a flat, greased surface, and left to cool. In my haste to find a flat pan in an unfamiliar kitchen, I grabbed one Fabrizia’s nice Cassata pans, as I was eyeing its flat, wide surface, perfect for spreading the praline.  I wasn’t able to find where, globally, you can get one online . But I did find some dynamite metal popsicle molds during my search.  Speaking of kitchen tools, I was wowed by this amazing, single-purpose Italian tool. When I asked Fabrizia where she got it, she replied, “In America.”  So somehow, people in the U.S. are able to roll the almond paste to fit snugly into the pan, but not actually find the right pan.  The first thing Fabrizia did was to make her own almond paste using finely ground almonds. Because I am a crunchy-granola California type, I asked if you could make the cake without the green food coloring.  Fabrizia laughed, but being Sicilian, she explained that Cassata is a cake for fun, festive occasions, and the vibrant green is part of the riot of colors that make the cake what it is meant to be. Although, perhaps bowing to overseas sensibilities, her mother, Anna Tasca Lanza said in one of her books that if you leave the green coloring out, you should pour the icing over the entire cake so that it hides the almond paste.  After cutting spongecake into strips to make a top layer for the cake, she whipped up a seriously good ricotta cream with the fresh sheeps’ milk ricotta we’d watched being made just the day before. Since she had a little extra, she tossed the bowl toward me with a spoon, and I dug right in.  Ladies and gentlemen, or signore e signori, no matter how far you are, if you are not booking a ticket to Sicily to taste sweetened sheeps’ milk ricotta cream, may the rest of your life be filled with neutral-colored almond paste. (ie: No fun at all.)  Because she knows that I love bergamots as much as she does, she doused the spongecake with homemade bergamot syrup, which gave me the idea to return in the winter, when the bergamot and citron trees are bearing fruit, and do some serious candying and syrup-making with her.

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology. Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) . What Arnott called proof through the “hard school of practical production” suggests an axiom that doing it by-hand is a kind of Occam’s razor for purifying and endorsing historical conjecture as common- | Question: To prove his theories of the diaspora of South American peoples, who sailed in a balsa raft called Kon Tiki across the Pacific Ocean in 1947?', ['ra ii', 'thor heyerdahl'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3515'), ("Context: Much of the city's tax base dissipated, leading to problems with funding education, sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits.

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975.

The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation.

While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.   Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.  While the vice president\'s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments.  Origin  The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state\'s combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state\'s favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector\'s state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector\'s second vote would go to a statesman of national character.  Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son\'s chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot.  Roles of the vice president  The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression "only a heartbeat away from the presidency," and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate.  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.    President of the United States Senate  As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney\'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.  Regular duties  As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote.

The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya and, under an agreement dated 8 October 1963, the Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the Colony of Kenya, the Sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would be one sovereign, independent state.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy. And while his team mate Fangio also won three races, for the fiercely proud Farina his being crowned World Champion only officially confirmed what he considered to be | Question: Nino Farina was the first world champion of what?", ['formula one championship', 'formula one world championship', 'formula 1', 'formula one'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1521'), ('Context: 2011 Census - Office for National Statistics - ons.gov.uk2011 Census - Office for National Statistics  2011 Census  Statistical bulletin:2011 Census: Population Estimates for the United Kingdom, March 2011  Estimates of the usually resident population of the UK and its constituent countries, by age and sex.

Censuses were undertaken by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales, National Records of Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. The 2011 Census data for the UK are based on the combined results of these individual censuses, which were all held on 27 March 2011. The 2011 Census outputs for the UK are delivered by the Office for National Statistics.  3. Introduction  First release of 2011 Census statistics for the United Kingdom  The UK population was 63,182,000 in 2011. This is the first population estimate for the UK to be produced from all three 2011 Censuses, which were conducted on 27 March 2011. This release includes estimates of the usually resident population of the UK and its constituent countries, by sex and five-year age band.  This bulletin follows the first release of statistics for England and Wales and for Northern Ireland on 16 July 2012 and for Scotland on 17 December 2012. The availability of 2011 Census population estimates for all four constituent countries now allows for the publication of UK level estimates.  Due to the breadth and depth of census data, results from the 2011 Census are being released in stages. Subsequent releases of UK census data will be available as soon as all constituent country data are available.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ("Context: Jan Evangelista Purkyně or Purkinje ( 1787 -- 1869 ) , a Czech physiologist and professor of anatomy at the University of Breslau , published a thesis in 1823 discussing 9 fingerprint patterns , but he did not mention any possibility of using fingerprints to identify people .

On November 9, 1922, he was named the winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."  The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of matter  (usually metals) when light shines on it. Einstein explained the effect by proposing that light consists of small particles, or quanta, called photons, which carry energy that is proportional to the frequency of light. The electrons in the matter that absorb the energy of the photon get ejected. He published these findings in 1905 in the paper "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light." Einstein\'s observations that the photoelectric effect could be explained only if light behaves like a particle, not a wave, was instrumental in establishing the hypothesis that light can behave both like a wave and a particle.  The photoelectric effect is the basis for photosynthesis. It also forms the basis for a variety of devices such as photodiodes, which are used in light detection within fiber optics, telecommunications networks, solar cells, imaging, and many other applications.  An interesting note: Records show the Nobel Prize Awarding Institution, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, decided to reserve the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, and therefore awarded no Physics prize that year. According to the statutes, a reserved prize can be awarded the year after, and Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for 1921 one year later, in 1922.  Einstein was unable to attend the December 10 Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm. He presented his Nobel speech on July 11, 1923, in Gothenburg.  Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, NJ.

This former thermal station, reputed to have 322 days of sunshine a year, is one of the oldest winter sports stations in the world. Saint Moritz began to develop in 1864 when the first ice skaters and curling enthusiasts came here from Scotland to try out its frozen lake. It’s here that skiing, known for centuries in Nordic countries as a means of locomotion, became, thanks to the hotel professional Johannes Badrutt, a sport and a pastime. With its 350 kilometers of slopes, Saint Moritz is the largest skiable resort in the world. On two occasions, in 1928 and 1948, the station hosted the winter Olympics, and in 1935, was the first to create a ski lift. This ultra trendy winter resort is also known as the birthplace of the bobsled, which Prince Albert of Monaco practices here on his visits to Switzerland.

Did he copy ...Why did Hitler make his moustache like that? Did he copy from Charlie Chaplin? - Quora  Quora  Updated Jul 29, 2014  Hitler\'s moustache was a variation of an early 20th century style called the toothbrush mustache .\xa0 Before the toothbrush mustache became popular in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, the predominant German mustache style was the Kaiser mustache or "kaiserbart," named after German emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II .  Although such a mustache would be the envy of current Brooklyn hipsters, the Kaiser mustache would have been extremely difficult to maintain.\xa0 In order to acquire the standard version of the toothbrush mustache, all a German man would have to do is simply snip off the ends of the Kaiser mustache, thereby saving a lot of time in mustache maintenance.\xa0 A New York Times article from 1907 suggests that the mustache was an American import to Germany and that German men were largely adopting it for convenience\'s sake, because German women of the time tended to prefer the old-style Kaiser mustache.  The notorious Hitler mustache is a variation of the original toothbrush mustache, which makes the mustache even narrower so that it never protrudes beyond the bridge of the nose.\xa0 In addition, the Hitler mustache compensated for the narrower length of the mustache by keeping the facial hair under the nose bushier.\xa0 Before Hitler became famous, his variant of the toothbrush mustache was not particularly popular, often nicknamed as a "Rotzbremse" (German for "snot brake") by Bavarians.\xa0 In fact, Hitler may have adopted his style of mustache because it was unpopular, reasoning that it would make him look more distinctive from the masses. When Hitler\'s friend Ernst Hanfstaengl asked him why he kept such an ugly mustache, Hitler replied, "If it is not the fashion now, it will be later because I wear it."  According to a Vanity Fair article Becoming Hitler , which extensively discusses the Hitler mustache,  Experts disagree on the exact year Hitler began wearing the Toothbrush. Ron Rosenbaum , perhaps the only historian to give the mustache its proper due, fixes its appearance with confidence. "It was Chaplin\'s first, before Hitler\'s," he writes in an essay from The Secret Parts of Fortune . "Chaplin adopted a little black crepe blot beneath the nose for his Mack Sennett silent comedies after 1915, Hitler didn\'t adopt his until late 1919, and there\'s no evidence (though some speculation) that Hitler modeled his \'stache on that other actor\'s."  But some suggest Hitler began wearing it earlier. According to a recently re-discovered essay by Alexander Moritz Frey, who served with Hitler in the First World War, Hitler wore the mustache in the trenches. Because he had been ordered to. The old bushy mustache did not fit under his equipment. In other words, the mustache that defines Hitler was cut in a shape to fit a gas mask. Which is perfect. Because Hitler was the bastard son of the Great War, conceived in the trenches, born in defeat. He inhaled mustard gas and exhaled Zyklon B. In another memoir, dismissed by some as a fraud, Hitler\'s sister-in-law Bridget claims she was the cause of the mustache. Bridget Hitler was Irish and lived in Liverpool, where, according to the memoir, the young Adolf spent a lost winter. Bridget (or whoever) says she often bickered with her brother-in-law. Because he was disagreeable, but mostly because she could not stand his unruly \'stache. In one of the great inadvertent summaries of historical character, she writes that in this, as in everything, he went too far.  Despite the multiple conflicting accounts of when Hitler first wore his distinctive mustache, it is doubtful that he adopted it because of Charlie Chaplin. One simple reason that Charlie Chaplin is probably not the inspiration for Hitler\'s mustache is that self-consciously adopting the mustache of a silent film comedian would have invited people to ridicule Hitler, which would have stopped his rise to power in its tracks.\xa0 Instead, | Question: What notorious leader had a similar style mustache to Charlie Chaplin?', ['hitler'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3943'), ("Context: Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass.

However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Originally, Hofburg Palace was a wintertime imperial residence for the almighty Habsburgs. After the Holy Roman Empire fell and the Austro-Hungarian Empire rose, however, the Emperor of Austria assumed control of the palace. It served as the Emperor of Austria\'s residence until 1918. A glorious edifice it is, the Hofburg Imperial Palace looms large right in the heart of Vienna. The palace complex is quite large, having been modified and added onto consistently after the first building went up in 1279. It\'s almost a small city within itself, offering curious visitors plenty to explore. You can\'t help but notice Hofburg Palace when touring Vienna\'s Old Town, and it begs a visit.  In Vienna, the Hofburg Imperial Palace is often just referred to as die Burg, which translates to "the palace". Boasting some 2,600 rooms, it is quite large, which helps to explain its status within the city. The palace faces the Heldenplatz, which is one of Vienna\'s most historical squares. It was here, for example, where Adolf Hitler announced the annexation of Austria to Germany , which occurred in 1938. The Heldenplatz was originally to become part of the greater Kaiserforum, or imperial forum, which Emperor Francis Joseph had in mind. The forum never saw completion, however. The Hofburg Imperial Palace itself was hardly completed when it first served as the seat of government in 1279. Many notable architects and engineers had a hand in the palace\'s expansions. Among the list of renowned architects were the von Erlachs, who were masterful Baroque designers. Their work is also on display at the Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna, which was the summertime imperial residence of the Habsburgs.  It can be hard to take it all in when enjoying tours of the Hofburg Imperial Palace. Often times, it helps    to focus on a few main areas. The Imperial Apartments    are definitely worth a look. They are lavish examples    of just how ornate European palace rooms can be, rivaling    what you can expect to see at the Palace    of Versailles in France ,    for example. The Schatzkammer, or Imperial    Treasury is also something that visitors to Hofburg Palace    will not want to miss. It can be accessed by a staircase    that leads from the Swiss Court, which is one of the earliest    parts of the palace complex. Inside the Treasury    are some of the most impressive jewels that you will see    anywhere in Europe. Among the sparkling exhibits    is a priceless imperial crown that is encrusted with diamonds,    rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. It dates back to    962! Stolen by Hitler in 1938, the crown would eventually    be returned to Vienna by the American Army.  Austria Map  Next to the Treasury is the Imperial Chapel, and it is here where the famous Vienna Boys\' Choir performs. They sing at Sunday Mass between the months of September and March. To see them, you will have to make reservations at least two months in advance, though standing-room-only spots are available for some 60 people each Sunday. One of the other main parts of Hofburg Palace that you will want to include in your visit is the New Palace Museum. It was the last major addition that was made to the palace, and it was completed not long before the advent of World War I. Among its exhibits are old musical instruments, a statuary, and an armory. The armory offers a rather different appeal than does the room of historical music instruments, and instead of claviers, violas, and lutes, you\'ll instead see swords, crossbows, and suits of armor.  The Hofburg Palace in Vienna is not only home to the Vienna Boys\' Choir, but also the Spanische Reitschule, or Spanish Riding School. Famous in its own right, it is where you can see the talented Lipizzaner stallions, who have been entertaining folks for four centuries with their sleek performances.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

Peter Davison was chosen due to his critically acclaimed role as Tristan Farnon in the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small which had Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner as line producer . [1]  The Fifth Doctor\'s era was notable for a "back to the basics" attitude, in which "silly" humour (and, to an extent, horror) was kept to a minimum, and more scientific accuracy was encouraged by the producer, John Nathan-Turner . It was, at times, a darker and grittier series, in part for seeing the death of one of his companions, Adric . It was also notable for the reintroduction of many of the Time Lord \'s enemies, such as the Master , Cybermen , Omega (a founding-father of Gallifrey ), the Black and White Guardians , and the Silurians .  \xa0 Biography  The Fourth Doctor \'s regeneration into the Fifth was a problematic one, and nearly failed, with the Doctor briefly taking on personality aspects from his four previous incarnations. After recovering in the fictional city Castrovalva (actually an elaborate trap created by his arch-enemy The Master ), he continued his travels with Tegan Jovanka , Nyssa and Adric . Initially his travels centred on getting Tegan back to Heathrow Airport in time for her first day as an airhostess, but the TARDIS repeatedly missed this destination and Tegan eventually decided to stay in the TARDIS. After trips to the future and the past encountering villains such as Monarch and the Mara , the Fifth Doctor was confronted with tragedy when Adric died trying to stop a space freighter from crashing into prehistoric Earth ( Earthshock ).  Following Adric\'s death, the TARDIS accidentally arrived at Heathrow airport ( Time-Flight ). Here the Doctor and Nyssa left Tegan assuming she would want to stay (when in fact she did not any more). The Doctor and Nyssa then travelled together for an unspecified amount of time before the renegade Time Lord Omega , attempting to return to our universe, temporally bonded himself to the Doctor ( Arc of Infinity ). Faced with this threat, the Time Lords were forced to attempt executing the Doctor, but he eventually tracked Omega to Amsterdam where he defeated him and re-encountered Tegan (who having now lost her job, had no second thoughts about rejoining the TARDIS crew).  When the Doctor met a new companion , an alien boy stranded on Earth by the name of Vislor Turlough , he did not know that Turlough had been commissioned by the Black Guardian to kill him. Soon after, Nyssa left to help cure Lazar\'s Disease on the space station Terminus . After meeting the entities known as Eternals racing in yacht-like spacecraft for the prize of " Enlightenment ", Turlough broke free from the Black Guardian\'s influence, and continued to travel with the Doctor and Tegan. Landing in the reign of King John, the crew again encountered The Master, who was using a shape-shifting robot Kamelion to impersonate the King.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring.

She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers.

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy.

In addition to her numerous administrative and teaching duties, de Valois choreographed several works, including The Rake\'s Progress (1935), The Prospect Before Us (1940) and a version of Don Quixote (1950). Her talent for launching national dance companies extended beyond Britain. She was instrumental in recommending Celia Franca for the position of founding artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada . In 1956, de Valois became the founding director of the Turkish State Ballet.  Although she officially retired from her position as artistic director of the Royal Ballet in 1963, de Valois remained on faculty at the Royal Ballet School for a number of years.

Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time.  During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north.  Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp.  Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced.  Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints.  Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life.  Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver.

Her stolen medal was returned  LONDON, England\xa0\xa0\xa0 ●\xa0 London police say a bronze Olympic medal stolen from field hockey player Hannah Macleod has been returned.  Macleod’s medal, together with one earned by rower Alex Partridge, had been snatched Wednesday from the Mahiki nightclub, where the athletes went following a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in honor of Britain’s Olympic team.  Macleod and Partridge had publicly appealed for their return. Her medal was mailed anonymously to the England Hockey head office.  Police say the medal is being retained as part of its investigation but will be returned to the athlete shortly.  Police stressed Friday that the hunt is still on for Partridge’s medal and Macleod’s team jacket.  Police say a 31-year-old man had been arrested in the case and was later released on bail.  Rower Alex Partridge is still waiting for the return of his medal.  Earlier Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod had appealed for the return of their stolen Olympic bronze medals from London 2012.  Partridge said he was devastated when he realised his blazer, which had the medal in an inside pocket, had gone.  The 31-year-old told BBC Sport: “It’s very, very upsetting. It would mean everything to me to get them back.”  Partridge, whose bronze in the men’s eight followed a silver medal at the Beijing Games in 2008, added: “I worked for 12 years of my life to try to achieve something at the Olympic Games and that’s what I’ve got to show for it.  “While we were out and dancing away, I noticed I’d misplaced my blazer. In the morning, I thought one of the other Olympians must have picked it up by accident, but no-one had it.  “I always say to people ‘it’s not about the medal, it’s about the journey’, but I guess you don’t appreciate the value of it until it’s not there.  “It was only when I picked up my 16-month-old daughter from nursery that it really dawned on me. If it doesn’t come back she won’t see everything I worked for, which was a representation of being in the best British Olympic team and possibly the best Olympics ever.”  Macleod, who won her London 2012 bronze medal with the women’s hockey team, believes the theft was pre-meditated after viewing CCTV footage.  “It looked like a very well done job,” Macleod told BBC Radio 5 live.  “The CCTV footage shows a couple who were acting suspiciously and had done a couple of laps of the bar, scoping things out prior to approaching our group.”  \xa0  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news ...Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news | The Guardian  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post  Hannah Macleod's medal, taken from London nightclub while athletes partied, posted anonymously to England Hockey  London 2012 Olympic medalist Hannah MacLeod, whose bronze medal for hockey has been returned.
