Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

Following the prior two stages , shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others . It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died .

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ("Context: The Broncos secured the services of Australian Kangaroos captain Wally Lewis and former BRL coach Wayne Bennett .

Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora 's travels , along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve ( with `` assistance '' from the viewing audience ) relating to riddles , the Spanish language , or counting . Common rituals may involve Dora 's encounters with Swiper , a bipedal , anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall - breaking interaction with the viewer . To stop Swiper , Dora must say `` Swiper no swiping '' three times . However , on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people , the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items . Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program 's antagonists ; the `` Grumpy Old Troll '' dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross , who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer 's help . Known for the constant breaking of the fourth - wall depicted in every episode , the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination , normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way .

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ("Context: `` A '' is the main antagonist of the series . `` A '' is stalking and torturing the Liars in relentless and creative ways and also threatens their friends and family .

She is an only child . Evie attends a school for gifted children ( run by her mother ) and achieves good grades there . Her mother had always told Evie that her father was a secret agent , but on her thirteenth birthday Evie began to develop superhuman abilities and it was revealed that her father is an extraterrestrial from the planet Antareus . Evie 's main power is the ability to freeze time on Earth by touching the tips of her index fingers together , allowing her to maneuver herself or objects to alter the course of events on Earth . When she claps her hands together , time resumes as normal . She can also `` unfreeze '' individuals by touching them while time is frozen . She later gains the power to gleep , which allows her to manifest objects by using the power of her mind .

Troy is a human - looking extraterrestrial , with many special powers , from the planet Antareus . Troy met Donna when his spacecraft crashed on Earth at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s . The two fell in love , were married in 1971 , and two years later Donna gave birth to Evie . Shortly after , in 1974 , Troy was called back to Antareus to fight in a war . Since then , Troy occasionally visits Earth , and stays in touch with his daughter via a special communication device known as the `` cube '' ( see below ) . Troy 's powers seem to be almost limitless : though he lives on Antareus , he can control many things on Earth ( from computers to the weather ) ; he can give and take away Evie 's powers at will ; and also seems to be aware of certain events on Earth . While Troy appears in the show 's opening credits , he rarely makes a physical appearance in the series -- and when he does his face is obscured ( for example , via a surgical mask or shadows ) .

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.  RELATED ARTICLES  Share  3...Fighting for freedom  After the euphoria of spring 1968, and Czechoslovakia’s short-lived break for freedom from the Soviet Union, came deep gloom that summer when Russian tanks rolled in to consign this proud nation to 20 more years of oppression.  The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures. Star exhibits include two views of the River Thames by Canaletto and Haymaking by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  Another of the city’s new attractions is totally different.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell .

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ("Context: The Broncos secured the services of Australian Kangaroos captain Wally Lewis and former BRL coach Wayne Bennett .

For over two years , she has been a guest and ward of Prince Doran , betrothed to his son , but her position has become tenuous with the death of Oberyn Martell , the Prince 's brother . In season 5 , Myrcella is shown at the Water Gardens with her betrothed , with whom she seems to have a good relationship . Unbeknownst to her , she has become a part of Ellaria Sand 's plans for revenge although Prince Doran refuses that the young princess be hurt as part of their revenge against the Lannisters . Myrcella is nearly taken by the Sand Snakes but is rescued by the Prince 's Guard . She later tells her uncle that she now considers Dorne her home and wants to marry Trystane . A while later , Prince Doran allows her to return to the capital with Jaime on the condition that Trystane accompany them , where he will become a member of the Small Council . On the jetty , about to board the ship , she forgives Ellaria Sand , who unexpectedly gives her a kiss on the mouth . On board the ship , Jaime awkwardly attempts to explain the true nature of his relationship with her mother , to which Myrcella responds that she already knows , having `` felt '' it for a long time . Jaime embraces his daughter , only to discover in horror that she is bleeding from a poison imbued orally by Ellaria . She collapses and dies in his arms . In season 6 , her body is returned to King 's Landing and laid to rest in the Great Sept of Baelor . Her funeral is attended only by Jaime and Tommen . | Question: who plays myrcella in game of thrones season 5 ?", ['Nell Tiger Free'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-20172'), ("Context: The series centers around Dora , a 7 ( Later 8 ) year old American girl of Indigenous Mexican heritage , with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to , accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots ( named for his beloved pair of red boots ) . Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora 's travels , along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve ( with `` assistance '' from the viewing audience ) relating to riddles , the Spanish language , or counting . Common rituals may involve Dora 's encounters with Swiper , a bipedal , anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall - breaking interaction with the viewer . To stop Swiper , Dora must say `` Swiper no swiping '' three times . However , on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people , the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items . Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program 's antagonists ; the `` Grumpy Old Troll '' dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross , who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer 's help . Known for the constant breaking of the fourth - wall depicted in every episode , the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination , normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way .

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ("Context: `` A '' is the main antagonist of the series . `` A '' is stalking and torturing the Liars in relentless and creative ways and also threatens their friends and family .

She is an only child . Evie attends a school for gifted children ( run by her mother ) and achieves good grades there . Her mother had always told Evie that her father was a secret agent , but on her thirteenth birthday Evie began to develop superhuman abilities and it was revealed that her father is an extraterrestrial from the planet Antareus . Evie 's main power is the ability to freeze time on Earth by touching the tips of her index fingers together , allowing her to maneuver herself or objects to alter the course of events on Earth . When she claps her hands together , time resumes as normal . She can also `` unfreeze '' individuals by touching them while time is frozen . She later gains the power to gleep , which allows her to manifest objects by using the power of her mind .

Troy is a human - looking extraterrestrial , with many special powers , from the planet Antareus . Troy met Donna when his spacecraft crashed on Earth at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s . The two fell in love , were married in 1971 , and two years later Donna gave birth to Evie . Shortly after , in 1974 , Troy was called back to Antareus to fight in a war . Since then , Troy occasionally visits Earth , and stays in touch with his daughter via a special communication device known as the `` cube '' ( see below ) . Troy 's powers seem to be almost limitless : though he lives on Antareus , he can control many things on Earth ( from computers to the weather ) ; he can give and take away Evie 's powers at will ; and also seems to be aware of certain events on Earth . While Troy appears in the show 's opening credits , he rarely makes a physical appearance in the series -- and when he does his face is obscured ( for example , via a surgical mask or shadows ) .

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.  RELATED ARTICLES  Share  3...Fighting for freedom  After the euphoria of spring 1968, and Czechoslovakia’s short-lived break for freedom from the Soviet Union, came deep gloom that summer when Russian tanks rolled in to consign this proud nation to 20 more years of oppression.  The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures. Star exhibits include two views of the River Thames by Canaletto and Haymaking by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  Another of the city’s new attractions is totally different. The Kafka Museum ( www.kafkamuseum.cz ) celebrates the writer (he was born here) whose name stands for the way the ordinary man is defeated by ‘the system’.  5...Pulling the strings  With his mischievous sense of fun, Mozart would have approved of the National Marionette Theatre’s comic performances of his opera Don Giovanni ( www.mozart.cz ).

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.  The phrase is now used internationally and it’s not surprising it has become the third most known slogan of all time.  \xa0  \xa0  [1] The phrase is a registered trademark of Ronseal’s owner, the Sherwin-Williams Company , across the European Community for products including paints, varnishes and wood preservatives (E3085826)  [3] Source Creative Review February 2012  \xa0  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tinThe Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin - BBC News  BBC News  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin  8 January 2013  Read more about sharing.  Close share panel  Prime Minister David Cameron used a famous advertising slogan to sum up the state of the coalition government at its halfway point, saying "it is a Ronseal deal - it does what it says on the tin". This phrase has entered the British vernacular, says its co-creator Dave Shelton.  David Cameron has said it before. In 2004, he said: "People are crying out for a kind of Ronseal politics - they want it to do what it says on the tin."  People use the phrase every day. On YouTube you can listen to Katie Melua\'s What It Says On The Tin . Google the line and you get millions of results.  In 1994, when my advertising partner Liz Whiston and I came up with the line "Does exactly what it says on the tin" for Ronseal, we never dreamed how it would enter the language.

A:  Quick Answer  In the Greek mythology story of Theseus and the Minotaur, King Minos of Crete ordered the labyrinth to be built as a way of housing a fierce half-man, half-bull creature known as the Minotaur, to whom seven young men and seven young women from Athens would be sacrificed each year. According to the myth, the labyrinth is a massive maze-like structure built by a man named Daedalus at the behest of King Minos; the maze that Daedalus constructed was so incredibly complex that even he could barely make his way through it. The hero Theseus ends up offering himself as a tribute to be sacrificed in the labyrinth, though his intention is to kill the Minotaur or die trying.

The Bodhi tree has played an important part in human history featuring strongly in religious history and mythology in various parts of the world.  The ficus religiosa, Bodhi tree, has large heart shaped leaves. It is one of the most sacred trees in India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it is venerated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The tree under which Siddhartha Gautama gained enlightenment over 2,600 years ago still grows today in North East India.  In Hindu religion, Vishnu is said to have been born under a Bodhi tree and is often depicted sitting on its heart-shaped leaves. The Bodhi tree is often planted in the grounds of temples and, of all the sacred trees of India, it is the most widely worshiped.  The Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka is located in Anuradhapura and is said to be the oldest tree in the world with a known planting date. This fig tree is said to have grown from a branch taken from the original Bodhi tree in India under which Buddha gained enlightenment.

It is the place where Prince Siddhartha Guatama, while meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.  Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it. As a young man, following the ancient traditions of Hinduism, he sought out spiritual teachers. Inquiring of their knowledge, he diligently practiced various yogas and meditations. Seven years passed, the last three in extreme asceticism, yet still he had not achieved his goal of enlightenment.  Impression of Buddha feet, Bodh Gaya \xa0\xa0\xa0  Siddhartha then journeyed toward the ancient sacred forests of Uruvela (modern Gaya in Bihar, in north India) with the intention of finally and completely realizing the infinite. Guided by visionary dreams and following in the footsteps of the Buddhas of three previous ages, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni and Kasyapa (who had each attained enlightenment at the site) Siddhartha sat beneath the Bodhi Tree. Touching the earth, thereby calling it to witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment, he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.  "Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve, but my body will not move from this seat until I have attained Enlightenment, so difficult to obtain in the course of great periods of time".  As Siddhartha sat in deep meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, Mara, the Dark Lord of Death, came to distract him from his endeavor. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama\'s words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Siddhartha\'s wisdom broke through Mara’s illusions. The power of his compassion transformed the demons\' weapons into flowers and Mara and all his forces fled. Three days and nights passed and Siddhartha’s intention was realized.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence.

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ('Context: The liturgy is divided into two main parts : The Liturgy of the Word ( Gathering , Proclaiming and Hearing the Word , Prayers of the People ) and the Liturgy of the Eucharist ( together with the Dismissal ) , but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist .

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."

The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.

A:  Quick Answer  In the Greek mythology story of Theseus and the Minotaur, King Minos of Crete ordered the labyrinth to be built as a way of housing a fierce half-man, half-bull creature known as the Minotaur, to whom seven young men and seven young women from Athens would be sacrificed each year. According to the myth, the labyrinth is a massive maze-like structure built by a man named Daedalus at the behest of King Minos; the maze that Daedalus constructed was so incredibly complex that even he could barely make his way through it. The hero Theseus ends up offering himself as a tribute to be sacrificed in the labyrinth, though his intention is to kill the Minotaur or die trying.

The Bodhi tree has played an important part in human history featuring strongly in religious history and mythology in various parts of the world.  The ficus religiosa, Bodhi tree, has large heart shaped leaves. It is one of the most sacred trees in India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it is venerated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The tree under which Siddhartha Gautama gained enlightenment over 2,600 years ago still grows today in North East India.  In Hindu religion, Vishnu is said to have been born under a Bodhi tree and is often depicted sitting on its heart-shaped leaves. The Bodhi tree is often planted in the grounds of temples and, of all the sacred trees of India, it is the most widely worshiped.  The Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka is located in Anuradhapura and is said to be the oldest tree in the world with a known planting date.

It is the place where Prince Siddhartha Guatama, while meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.  Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it. As a young man, following the ancient traditions of Hinduism, he sought out spiritual teachers. Inquiring of their knowledge, he diligently practiced various yogas and meditations.

Touching the earth, thereby calling it to witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment, he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.  "Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve, but my body will not move from this seat until I have attained Enlightenment, so difficult to obtain in the course of great periods of time".  As Siddhartha sat in deep meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, Mara, the Dark Lord of Death, came to distract him from his endeavor. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama\'s words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Siddhartha\'s wisdom broke through Mara’s illusions. The power of his compassion transformed the demons\' weapons into flowers and Mara and all his forces fled. Three days and nights passed and Siddhartha’s intention was realized.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence.

You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ('Context: The liturgy is divided into two main parts : The Liturgy of the Word ( Gathering , Proclaiming and Hearing the Word , Prayers of the People ) and the Liturgy of the Eucharist ( together with the Dismissal ) , but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist .

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.  Postcards from Paradise is officially out on March 31. For more on Ringo visit ringostarr.com .

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Vanessa has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth when around people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor tends to include bad puns , which irritate Mike and the girls to no end .   Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses more liberal beliefs .

She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons .   Molly Ephraim as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is nowhere near as intelligent as her sisters ( though her penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework might label her as voluntarily dumb ) , but excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house .

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000.

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ("Context: The apparent magnitude ( m ) of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth .

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

What’s Going On? According to Sondheim and Lapine  The painting’s setting is the island of la Grande Jatte, which is located northwest of Paris in the Seine River. In 1884 (when Seurat began working on his painting), the island was a pastoral place where people could go to get away from city life. The musical’s creative artists pulled their characters from the canvas. Here’s a Who’s Who:  The most prominent figure is the woman in profile on the bottom right hand side.

The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000.

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ("Context: The apparent magnitude ( m ) of a celestial object is a number that is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth .

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.  Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become \'\'a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,\'\' the Prince said, \'\'I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.\'\' But then he added, \'\'Look, if a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which | Question: "Who famously said after the \'Dunblane Massacre\', ""If a cricketer for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats""?" ?', ['duke of edinburgh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6259'), ('Context: Breaking news on Wichita, KS, US - breakingnews.comBreaking news on Wichita, KS, US - breakingnews.com  Download the free Breaking News app for faster updates, alerts and live video.  Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R. Mead, an associate of Jesse Chisholm in the early-day trading business.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ("Context: In spite of the facts that Nat King Cole had the # 7 song in 1959 , and the # 1 song in 1961 , and Chuck Berry had a major hit with `` Maybellene '' in 1955 , in the United States in the 1950s legal segregation and discrimination against African Americans was common , especially in the Deep South .

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R. Mead, an associate of Jesse Chisholm in the early-day trading business.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ("Context: In spite of the facts that Nat King Cole had the # 7 song in 1959 , and the # 1 song in 1961 , and Chuck Berry had a major hit with `` Maybellene '' in 1955 , in the United States in the 1950s legal segregation and discrimination against African Americans was common , especially in the Deep South .

At the end of the century the new town was laid out over much of the ground that once belonged to the abbey. Paisley became famous for its paisley shawls in silk and cotton (and later in wool), which were copies of the Asian shawls sent by British soldiers serving in India. A priceless collection is on exhibit in the Paisley Museum and Art Galleries. Later the manufacture of linen thread gave way to that of cotton, and Paisley grew rapidly.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

According to movie scholars and critics, Nollywood industry, which despite its relative young emergence in the global movie market has successfully become an enviable artistic cultural vehicle with which African narrative is communicated to the world, ironically emerged as a child of necessity to fill the gap created by the total collapse of the country’s theatre and stage culture.  According to industry sources, the failure of government in providing adequate security surveillance over life and property in the late 80s’and early 90s’resulted in the very negative manner at which the public viewed public shows, especially as it had to do with cinema, stage and theatrical performances with disenchantment.  Video filmartistes at a film shooting site  Also added to this ugly development “was the fact that there were inadequate television stations across the country with enough entertainment contents to satisfy the yearning needs of the viewing public, a development that led\xa0content providers to seek alternative.”  “Nollywood was a child of necessity” says Professor Ahmed Yerima, theatre artiste and former Artistic Director of The National Troupe of Nigeria. He said: “There were very few television stations and we got to a point where the TV stations that existed needed you, the producer, to get sponsorship for your productions.”  Movie-theatre going culture  But for Obby Patrick Ebewo, Nigerian born and American based film scholar, “The collapse of movie-theatre going culture in the 1980s caused by incessant harassment of innocent citizen by criminals, the country’s economic downturn and various problems affecting celluloid film production, gave rise to video film.”  The implication of this new development, according to Yerima, was that fast thinking and business minded entrepreneurs cashed into the opportunity provided by this yearning need; and aided with the arrival of VHS tapes embarked on a business trial and experimentation that was to transform the continent’s entertainment turf.  Prior to this boom, efforts had been made by some dramatists to evolve a film culture in Nigeria. It is on record that as early as the 1960s’ theatre artistes in the mould of Hubert Ogunde, had recorded his plays on celluloid. Other artistes like Moses Adejumo and Duro Ladipo had equally attempted to reduce the cinematic art of film to a more popular medium for social commentary.  In an effort to trace the emergence of Nollywood and the entire film culture in the country, Ebewo argues that “the current video film industry in Nigeria owes a huge debt to the pioneering efforts of Nigerian theatre, particularly practitioners of the Yoruba Travelling theatre, who branched off from mainstream theatre to experiment with celluloid.”  However, the Nollywood brand today owes its projection and commercial resourcefulness to Kenneth Nnebue, who according to market consensus, pioneered the raving popular media brand with his movie, Living in Bondage, in 1992.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously. Three women were awarded the GC for resistance activities in occupied  territories during WW 2. One of them was Noor Inayat Khan.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb. Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films. A few years later, this kind of thing would be done better with WHERE EAGLES DARE.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Berthing in Nigeria in 1992, this entertainment industry popularly known as Nollywood is acclaimed by industry players to rank as the third largest movie industry in the world after India’s Bollywood and America’s Nollywood. According to movie scholars and critics, Nollywood industry, which despite its relative young emergence in the global movie market has successfully become an enviable artistic cultural vehicle with which African narrative is communicated to the world, ironically emerged as a child of necessity to fill the gap created by the total collapse of the country’s theatre and stage culture.  According to industry sources, the failure of government in providing adequate security surveillance over life and property in the late 80s’and early 90s’resulted in the very negative manner at which the public viewed public shows, especially as it had to do with cinema, stage and theatrical performances with disenchantment.  Video filmartistes at a film shooting site  Also added to this ugly development “was the fact that there were inadequate television stations across the country with enough entertainment contents to satisfy the yearning needs of the viewing public, a development that led\xa0content providers to seek alternative.”  “Nollywood was a child of necessity” says Professor Ahmed Yerima, theatre artiste and former Artistic Director of The National Troupe of Nigeria. He said: “There were very few television stations and we got to a point where the TV stations that existed needed you, the producer, to get sponsorship for your productions.”  Movie-theatre going culture  But for Obby Patrick Ebewo, Nigerian born and American based film scholar, “The collapse of movie-theatre going culture in the 1980s caused by incessant harassment of innocent citizen by criminals, the country’s economic downturn and various problems affecting celluloid film production, gave rise to video film.”  The implication of this new development, according to Yerima, was that fast thinking and business minded entrepreneurs cashed into the opportunity provided by this yearning need; and aided with the arrival of VHS tapes embarked on a business trial and experimentation that was to transform the continent’s entertainment turf.  Prior to this boom, efforts had been made by some dramatists to evolve a film culture in Nigeria. It is on record that as early as the 1960s’ theatre artistes in the mould of Hubert Ogunde, had recorded his plays on celluloid. Other artistes like Moses Adejumo and Duro Ladipo had equally attempted to reduce the cinematic art of film to a more popular medium for social commentary.  In an effort to trace the emergence of Nollywood and the entire film culture in the country, Ebewo argues that “the current video film industry in Nigeria owes a huge debt to the pioneering efforts of Nigerian theatre, particularly practitioners of the Yoruba Travelling theatre, who branched off from mainstream theatre to experiment with celluloid.”  However, the Nollywood brand today owes its projection and commercial resourcefulness to Kenneth Nnebue, who according to market consensus, pioneered the raving popular media brand with his movie, Living in Bondage, in 1992.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously.

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000. Westwood has performed particularly well in European Tour events, having won a total of 18 tournaments, and in 2000 he achieved the European Tour Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s seven year run of victory.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.

He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797.  In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  It is often  first Gothic  novel  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.  Notes by Lesley Young  WALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The) - naxos.comWALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The)  The Castle of Otranto  \xa0  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister. He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797. In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, | Question: 'The Castle of Otranto' often called the first gothic novel, was written in 1764 by whom?", ['horace walpole'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4725'), ("Context: LeBron James and Stephen Curry were named as captains due to being the leading vote getter from the East and West , respectively .

The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK).

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open.

Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen. Everything | Question: Who designed the Volkswagen Beetle?', ['ferdinand porsche'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5487')]

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Location of Coney Island on a map.  Coney Island is a city found in New York , The United States Of America . It is located 40.58 latitude and -73.99 longitude and it is situated at elevation 2 meters above sea level.  Coney Island has a population of 60,000 making it the 23rd biggest city in New York. It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.  Things to Do and See in Coney Island  The Coney Island Museum  For less than a dollar, visitors can get to see artifacts that bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear Coney Island in this quaint museum. Located on the second floor of an historic building on Surf Avenue with a delightful view of classic amusement park rides, the Coney Island museum interprets and preserves the history of the area through a small but fascinating collection of items. Visitors get to see quirky pieces of the collection, such as a hand-carved figure of the Steeplechase Man and Boardwalk rolling chair.  The museum is open every Saturday and Sunday between 12 and 5 pm, right through the year, with opening hours sometimes extended during the summer months. The museum also serves as a tourist information center where visitors can use the bathrooms and receive knowledgeable answers to the questions about the area.

With its legendary casino and countless rows of millionaires' yachts in the harbour, Monaco is a glamorous place that lies at the very heart of the jet-set. It is also unique in that for many of the drivers the race is run on their doorstep, with the same streets they use for a daily trip to the newsagents, transformed into a race track.  Winding through the streets it is a circuit that has remained remarkably unchanged since the first race was staged in 1929. Before the war the circuit was witness to several great battles, with the legendary Tazio Nuvolari often among the winners. When World Championship racing began in 1950 Monaco played host to the second race, just a week after the first round at Silverstone. That race resulted in a massive pile-up on the very first lap and provided Fangio with his first ever championship victory. Since then the race has been plagued by a high attrition rate that has thrown up some unusual victories over the years. The combination of narrow roads, high kerbs and the close proximity of some unforgiving crash barriers, many a great driver has suffered at the hands of a track that quickly punishes the slightest error in judgement.  One memorable race came in 1955, the year that is best remembered for Alberto Ascari's trip into the harbour, a feat that was later emulated by the Australian driver Paul Hawkins. Both men survived their dunking although a number of driver's have not been so lucky. Luigi Fagioli was killed in a sports car race here in 1952 and Lorenzo Bandini was burned to death in 1967. Other driver's have far happier memories of the place. Graham Hill, for years known as 'Mister Monaco', won here five times. A record he held until the arrival of Ayrton Senna.

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil\'s people", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "scharfe Barmherzigkeit" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames." Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews\' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these "envenomed worms" would be forced into labour or expelled "for all time".

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.

The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 . Furthermore , a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10 , 1779 , documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army 's use in battle . | Question: who made the american flag and what year was it ?", ['1777'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-4622'), ("Context: The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-gothic style .

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

It is located 40.58 latitude and -73.99 longitude and it is situated at elevation 2 meters above sea level.  Coney Island has a population of 60,000 making it the 23rd biggest city in New York. It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.  Things to Do and See in Coney Island  The Coney Island Museum  For less than a dollar, visitors can get to see artifacts that bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear Coney Island in this quaint museum. Located on the second floor of an historic building on Surf Avenue with a delightful view of classic amusement park rides, the Coney Island museum interprets and preserves the history of the area through a small but fascinating collection of items. Visitors get to see quirky pieces of the collection, such as a hand-carved figure of the Steeplechase Man and Boardwalk rolling chair.

The Circuit:  Monaco is unique, and to many the annual blast round the streets of the tiny principality represents the jewel in the crown of Formula One. With its legendary casino and countless rows of millionaires' yachts in the harbour, Monaco is a glamorous place that lies at the very heart of the jet-set. It is also unique in that for many of the drivers the race is run on their doorstep, with the same streets they use for a daily trip to the newsagents, transformed into a race track.  Winding through the streets it is a circuit that has remained remarkably unchanged since the first race was staged in 1929. Before the war the circuit was witness to several great battles, with the legendary Tazio Nuvolari often among the winners. When World Championship racing began in 1950 Monaco played host to the second race, just a week after the first round at Silverstone. That race resulted in a massive pile-up on the very first lap and provided Fangio with his first ever championship victory. Since then the race has been plagued by a high attrition rate that has thrown up some unusual victories over the years. The combination of narrow roads, high kerbs and the close proximity of some unforgiving crash barriers, many a great driver has suffered at the hands of a track that quickly punishes the slightest error in judgement.  One memorable race came in 1955, the year that is best remembered for Alberto Ascari's trip into the harbour, a feat that was later emulated by the Australian driver Paul Hawkins. Both men survived their dunking although a number of driver's have not been so lucky. Luigi Fagioli was killed in a sports car race here in 1952 and Lorenzo Bandini was burned to death in 1967. Other driver's have far happier memories of the place. Graham Hill, for years known as 'Mister Monaco', won here five times. A record he held until the arrival of Ayrton Senna.

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 .

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: Brian Ralston  Brian Ralston (born April 12, 1974) is a composer and musician living in Los Angeles.

"It\'s the deadliest thing in the sea," according to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in Washington. "Victims usually experience shock, muscular cramps, numbness, nausea, vomiting, severe backache, frothing at the mouth, constriction of the throat, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, paralysis, delirium, convulsion and, finally, death."  Dozens of people are killed each year by these transparent, grapefruit-size predators. So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  "Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks," said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. "That\'s because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim\'s susceptibility to the creature\'s venom."  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp\'s venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra\'s, only deadlier.  "Even a mild brush can cause intense pain," writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. "The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time."  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp\'s long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  "Stay out of those waters at all costs," advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World\'s Most Dangerous Creatures. "Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don\'t actually come after humans to attack."  Syndicated writer Randall Floyd lives in Augusta.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.  In June 1992, the High Court of Australia overturned the previous concept of terra nullius which stated that, in legal terms, Australia was empty of inhabitants when it was first settled by Europeans | Question: What is Australia's largest island?", ['tasmania'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3945'), ("Context: The Panthers were announced as the league 's 29th franchise in 1993 , and began play in 1995 .

The first Yazoo single, "Only You" b/w "Situation," was a double-sided smash, and their debut, Upstairs at Eric\'s (named after Mute Records\' head Eric Radcliffe) went gold in the U.K. After they finished recording their second album, You and Me Both, Clarke opted out of the group. Yazoo was the template for Erasure , Clarke\'s long-running collaboration with diva Andy Bell , and numerous new bands that blended dance-pop and synthesizers. In 2008, Clarke and Moyet united for a tour of the U.K., Europe, and North America. The concerts were recorded and the result is this two-CD set. Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance. At the end of "State Farm," the funky white-girl rap from You and Me Both that kicks off side two of the set, Moyet laughs with almost girlish delight at the crowd\'s enthusiastic reaction. The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts. There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along. The sound on the set is a bit muddy, but the duo\'s enthusiastic performance more than makes up for the sonic limitations. ~ j. poet  Reconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusicReconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Reconnected: Live  google+  AllMusic Review                             by j. poet  In the early \'80s, Vince Clarke quit Depeche Mode , allegedly dissatisfied with their move toward pop music.

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can\'t wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read "Snow," Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, "felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf."  He has spoken up for others in peril.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: Brian Ralston  Brian Ralston (born April 12, 1974) is a composer and musician living in Los Angeles.

"It\'s the deadliest thing in the sea," according to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in Washington. "Victims usually experience shock, muscular cramps, numbness, nausea, vomiting, severe backache, frothing at the mouth, constriction of the throat, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, paralysis, delirium, convulsion and, finally, death."  Dozens of people are killed each year by these transparent, grapefruit-size predators. So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  "Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks," said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. "That\'s because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim\'s susceptibility to the creature\'s venom."  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp\'s venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra\'s, only deadlier.  "Even a mild brush can cause intense pain," writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. "The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time."  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp\'s long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  "Stay out of those waters at all costs," advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World\'s Most Dangerous Creatures. "Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don\'t actually come after humans to attack."  Syndicated writer Randall Floyd lives in Augusta.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

He soon hooked up with Alison Moyet , an R&B singer with a powerful deep alto, and started recording as Yazoo . (In the U.S., after the blues record label Yazoo sued them, they were known as Yaz.) The first Yazoo single, "Only You" b/w "Situation," was a double-sided smash, and their debut, Upstairs at Eric\'s (named after Mute Records\' head Eric Radcliffe) went gold in the U.K. After they finished recording their second album, You and Me Both, Clarke opted out of the group. Yazoo was the template for Erasure , Clarke\'s long-running collaboration with diva Andy Bell , and numerous new bands that blended dance-pop and synthesizers. In 2008, Clarke and Moyet united for a tour of the U.K., Europe, and North America. The concerts were recorded and the result is this two-CD set. Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance. At the end of "State Farm," the funky white-girl rap from You and Me Both that kicks off side two of the set, Moyet laughs with almost girlish delight at the crowd\'s enthusiastic reaction. The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts.

The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along. The sound on the set is a bit muddy, but the duo\'s enthusiastic performance more than makes up for the sonic limitations. ~ j. poet  Reconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusicReconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Reconnected: Live  google+  AllMusic Review                             by j. poet  In the early \'80s, Vince Clarke quit Depeche Mode , allegedly dissatisfied with their move toward pop music.

The first Yazoo single, "Only You" b/w "Situation," was a double-sided smash, and their debut, Upstairs at Eric\'s (named after Mute Records\' head Eric Radcliffe ) went gold in the U.K. After they finished recording their second album, You and Me Both , Clarke opted out of the group. Yazoo was the template for Erasure , Clarke \'s long-running collaboration with diva Andy Bell , and numerous new bands that blended dance-pop and synthesizers. In 2008, Clarke and Moyet united for a tour of the U.K., Europe, and North America.

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can\'t wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read "Snow," Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, "felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf."  He has spoken up for others in peril.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

The gecko first appeared in 1999 , during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors . The original commercial features the Gecko , voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer , who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters `` This is my final plea : I am a gecko , not to be confused with GEICO , which could save you hundreds on car insurance . So , STOP CALLING ME ! '' , before licking his eye . Later `` wrong number '' ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko . In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood ( which portray him as a representative of the company ) , the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent , because it would be unexpected , according to Martin Agency 's Steve Bassett . In 2010s commercials , the gecko 's accent is more working - class , perhaps in an effort to further `` humanize '' him . `` As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better , we did a few things , '' says Steve Bassett , creative director at The Martin Agency . `` We wanted to make him a little more guy - next - door . And he looks a lot more real than he 's looked before .

When creating the character , screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite . Wasikowska read Carroll 's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role . She also watched Jan Švankmajer 's Alice . She said , `` When we were kids , my mum would pop it in the VCR player . We would be disturbed , and would n't really understand it , but we could n't look away because it was too intriguing . So I had kept that feeling about Alice , a kind of haunting feeling . '' Although facing pressures to conform to society 's expectations , Alice grows into a stronger - willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path ; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls , describing the character as `` stubborn , brave , ( and ) non-girlie '' . Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six - year - old girl .   Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp , The Mad Hatter . Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character . '' The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt ; Depp believes that the character `` was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair , through his fingernails and eyes '' . Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C.

Bonham Carter 's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen . The character hates animals , and chooses to use them as servants and furniture .

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

The location(s) of the Adrenal Glands:  The human body normally* includes two adrenal glands.  They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts.

This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

If you need assistance with writing a research paper on Dante\'s Inferno, Paper Masters can assign one of our professional literary writers to explicate the elements of the Inferno. Below, we give you a sample of how our writer\'s have explained the circles of hell in the Inferno.  Dante’s Inferno is the first part of his epic poem The Divine Comedy , written between 1308 and 1321. The word “Inferno” is Italian for “Hell,” and this part of the work describes the poet’s allegorical journey through the nine circles of Hell. On this journey he is guided by the Roman poet Virgil.  The poem opens with the poet lost in the woods, chased by three beasts, and falling into a deep place. Virgil, who tells Dante that he has been sent by his beloved, deceased Beatrice, rescues him.  The two thus begin their journey through Hell . Each circle is an allegory , frequently representing poetic justice. The first circle of Hell is Limbo, where the unbaptized and virtuous pagans reside. Here Dante meets Homer , Ovid, Cicero and many famous figures from antiquity.  Hell and Dante\'s Inferno  The second circle of Hell is Lust, where the souls of carnal sinners are blackened by an endless wind. In the third circle, Gluttony, a giant worm forces those condemned to lie in a foul mud. These individuals are unaware of their neighbors, indicative of the selfish nature of this sin . The fourth circle, greed, is home to many popes and cardinals, forced to push great weights with their chests.  Wrath, the fifth circle, has sinners fighting each other in the River Styx. Beyond this are the walls of Dis, which separate the deepest pits of Hell, where active (rather than passive) sinners are sent. Heresy, Violence, Fraud and Treachery are the innermost circles of the Inferno.  The City of Dis serves as the gateway to the Nether Hell, separating those guilty of sin by | Question: What Italian author envisioned 9 circles of hell?', ['alighieri', 'dante', 'dante alighieri'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3847')]

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

The gecko first appeared in 1999 , during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors . The original commercial features the Gecko , voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer , who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters `` This is my final plea : I am a gecko , not to be confused with GEICO , which could save you hundreds on car insurance . So , STOP CALLING ME ! '' , before licking his eye . Later `` wrong number '' ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko . In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood ( which portray him as a representative of the company ) , the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent , because it would be unexpected , according to Martin Agency 's Steve Bassett . In 2010s commercials , the gecko 's accent is more working - class , perhaps in an effort to further `` humanize '' him . `` As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better , we did a few things , '' says Steve Bassett , creative director at The Martin Agency . `` We wanted to make him a little more guy - next - door .

When creating the character , screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite . Wasikowska read Carroll 's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role . She also watched Jan Švankmajer 's Alice . She said , `` When we were kids , my mum would pop it in the VCR player . We would be disturbed , and would n't really understand it , but we could n't look away because it was too intriguing . So I had kept that feeling about Alice , a kind of haunting feeling . '' Although facing pressures to conform to society 's expectations , Alice grows into a stronger - willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path ; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls , describing the character as `` stubborn , brave , ( and ) non-girlie '' . Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six - year - old girl .   Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp , The Mad Hatter . Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character .

Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C. Nesbitt character ) reflecting a darker , more dangerous personality . Illusionary dancer David `` Elsewhere '' Bernal doubled for Depp during the `` Futterwacken '' sequence near the end of the film .   Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims , the Red Queen . She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters : the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts . Her first name is a play on the word irascible because she is easily irritated , obstreperous , impatient , and quick to anger . Bonham Carter 's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen . The character hates animals , and chooses to use them as servants and furniture . It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband , the King . The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell , a toddler , stating that , `` The Red Queen is just like a toddler , because she 's got a big head and she 's a tyrant . ''   Anne Hathaway as Mirana of Marmoreal , the White Queen . She was one of few characters that did not require digital manipulation . Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife ; `` Cute but psycho . Things even out . '' According to Hathaway , `` She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen .

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

The location(s) of the Adrenal Glands:  The human body normally* includes two adrenal glands.  They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings. On the first Friday of each month, crowds of locals and visitors head to the First Friday Gallery Hop at Railroad Square, a former lumber yard in downtown Tallahassee that is now home to over 50 eclectic shops, galleries and art studios.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

If you need assistance with writing a research paper on Dante\'s Inferno, Paper Masters can assign one of our professional literary writers to explicate the elements of the Inferno. Below, we give you a sample of how our writer\'s have explained the circles of hell in the Inferno.  Dante’s Inferno is the first part of his epic poem The Divine Comedy , written between 1308 and 1321. The word “Inferno” is Italian for “Hell,” and this part of the work describes the poet’s allegorical journey through the nine circles of Hell. On this journey he is guided by the Roman poet Virgil.  The poem opens with the poet lost in the woods, chased by three beasts, and falling into a deep place. Virgil, who tells Dante that he has been sent by his beloved, deceased Beatrice, rescues him.  The two thus begin their journey through Hell . Each circle is an allegory , frequently representing poetic justice. The first circle of Hell is Limbo, where the unbaptized and virtuous pagans reside. Here Dante meets Homer , Ovid, Cicero and many famous figures from antiquity.  Hell and Dante\'s Inferno  The second circle of Hell is Lust, where the souls of carnal sinners are blackened by an endless wind. In the third circle, Gluttony, a giant worm forces those condemned to lie in a foul mud. These individuals are unaware of their neighbors, indicative of the selfish nature of this sin . The fourth circle, greed, is home to many popes and cardinals, forced to push great weights with their chests.  Wrath, the fifth circle, has sinners fighting each other in the River Styx. Beyond this are the walls of Dis, which separate the deepest pits of Hell, where active (rather than passive) sinners are sent. Heresy, Violence, Fraud and Treachery are the innermost circles of the Inferno.

This is a video from AnswersinGenesis correcting a lot of the common misconceptions about the famous Scopes Monkey Trial.  Check out GreenSlugg.com for more Creation vs. Evolution information.  Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks.

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can\'t wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read "Snow," Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, "felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf."  He has spoken up for others in peril.

New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

The islands comprise the two Indonesian propinsi (or provinsi; provinces) of North Maluku (Maluku Utara) and Maluku . The principal islands of North Maluku are Halmahera , Obi , Morotai , Bacan , and the main islands of the Sula archipelago (Taliabu, Mangole, and Sulabesi); significant smaller islands include Ternate and Tidore . To the south, the province of Maluku encompasses , most notably, the islands of Ceram (Seram), Buru , and Ambon , as well as the Banda , Wetar , Babar , Tanimbar , Kai , and Aru archipelagos. Area 30,462 square miles (78,897 square km). Pop. (2000) 1,981,401; (2010) 2,571,593.  Geography  Most of the Moluccas are mountainous, although the Tanimbar and Aru island groups are low and swampy. Earthquakes are frequent, and several islands, especially Ternate and Banda , have active volcanoes . The climate of the Moluccas is tropical, with rainfall varying from 80 to 150 inches (2,000 to 3,800 mm) annually in various locations. Some of the land has been cleared for cultivation, but other areas remain covered with evergreen rainforest . There are patches of open savanna , and the coasts are often fringed with mangrove swamps. The Moluccas are a transition zone between Asian and Australian fauna and flora, and the animal life and vegetation of the islands include many species that are unique to the region.  The population of the islands is diverse , with the Ambonese, Butonese (people from the island of Buton in Southeast Sulawesi ), and Kai peoples together constituting roughly one-third of the islands’ residents in relatively equal numbers. Most of the remainder of the population consists of scores of smaller groups, many living in sparsely settled inland regions, as well a notable minority of Chinese descent, concentrated primarily in larger towns and urban areas. The principal cities of the Moluccas include Ambon (on the island of Ambon ), in the central region, and Ternate (on the island of Ternate ), in the north.  Similar Topics  Andaman Islands  Dozens of languages are spoken in the Moluccas, although Malay (of which the national language, Indonesian, is a dialect) has for centuries been used as a lingua franca ; in many areas, Malay has eclipsed local languages. Christianity (mostly Protestant ) and Islam are the dominant religions. A small but notable minority practices Hinduism or Buddhism , and some communities in the interior regions follow local religions. Except in northern Halmahera , Morotai , Ternate, Tidore, and several other areas of the northern Moluccas—where West Papuan languages are spoken—all languages spoken in the islands belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.  Most residents are engaged in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Rice, coconuts, and cocoa are widely grown, and fish, forest products, copra , and spices are among the most significant exports. Petroleum is mined in limited quantities, primarily on Ceram.  History  The cloves of the northern Moluccas and the nutmeg of the central islands were traded in Asia long before Europeans heard of the so-called Spice Islands . The Portuguese established themselves on the islands in 1512, beginning many decades of conflict that caused great losses of life. The first major confrontation was between the Portuguese and the reigning sultans of Ternate and Tidore ; later, the Spanish, English, and Dutch wrestled for control of the islands. Eventually, the Dutch emerged victorious, and they earned large profits from their enterprise in the Moluccas.

Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Edith Cresson was born January 27, 1934, in a fashionable Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Her father was a senior civil servant. Raised by a British nanny, she became fluent in the English language. Cresson attended the School of Advanced Commercial Studies, earning a degree in business and later a doctorate in demography.  A successful businesswoman, she added a second career in politics when she met François Mitterrand in 1965. For the next 26 years the future president helped Cresson advance through the ranks of what is now the French Socialist Party, calling her "my little soldier."  After Mitterrand became president in 1981, Cresson served first as minister of agriculture (1981-1983), then as minister of external trade and tourism (1983-1984), as minister of industrial restructuring and external trade (1984-1986), and finally minister of foreign affairs (1988-1990). She resigned from the government on October 3, 1990, to work as a consultant on international development. Meanwhile she was three times elected a deputy to the National Assembly from the Vienne province (1981, 1986, 1988).  Then in May 1991, President Mitterrand asked Cresson to form a new government. Some experts believe Mitterand had grown dissatisfied with the failures of the government of Michel Rocard to gain majorities in the National Assembly.   Others believe the French president foresaw major international trade issues looming as the trans-European Union came into existence, and sought Cresson\'s expertise in trade affairs.  As prime minister, the combative Cresson planned to strengthen France\'s industrial power and to "protect" French and European trade from the inroads of Japanese and American products. In assembling her new cabinet of 29 members she chose a number of holdovers from the government of her predecessor. One, Pierre Brgovoy, was named to head a new superministry combining economic, trade, industrial, and technology affairs. His appointment served to restore trust in the French leadership in financial markets. She also appointed five women, three to posts in labor, development, and youth and sports.  When her appointment to prime minister drew misogynist remarks from some politicians of France\'s center and right parties, Cresson said, "Men are not in any sense irreplaceable except in one\'s private life." Nevertheless, more fair-minded criticism about her ability to command majorities in the National Assembly persisted.  The Cresson government moved aggressively to free what had become a stagnant economy, and on contentious domestic issues, frequently centered around immigrants. Quoted making strident and antagonistic comments about the Japanese "strategy of conquest," Cresson was greatly concerned over what she was convinced to be Japan\'s major threat to European trade and commonwealth. Diplomatically, her outspokenness was creating unease in international circles. Within four months of becoming president, the Cresson government had fallen precipitously in popularity. Subtle and not-so-subtle attacks on her gender continued, including a popular daytime television show featuring two puppet characters, one a sexy and servile female broadly seen as a Cresson parody. In April 1992, Cresson resigned. Since then she has served as Commissioner for Science, Research and Development to the European Commission.  Cresson\'s husband, Jacques, a retired executive of Peugeot, the French automobile and appliance company, remained supportive of his wife, and their relationship has been likened to that of Margaret Thatcher and her husband. Cresson has been compared to the British prime minister for her bluntness, energy, and stubbornness. They have two daughters.

Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can\'t wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read "Snow," Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, "felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf."  He has spoken up for others in peril.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

The Philippines , the Philippine Sea , and the Pacific Ocean are to the north; the Arafura Sea and the island of Timor are to the south.  The islands comprise the two Indonesian propinsi (or provinsi; provinces) of North Maluku (Maluku Utara) and Maluku . The principal islands of North Maluku are Halmahera , Obi , Morotai , Bacan , and the main islands of the Sula archipelago (Taliabu, Mangole, and Sulabesi); significant smaller islands include Ternate and Tidore . To the south, the province of Maluku encompasses , most notably, the islands of Ceram (Seram), Buru , and Ambon , as well as the Banda , Wetar , Babar , Tanimbar , Kai , and Aru archipelagos. Area 30,462 square miles (78,897 square km). Pop. (2000) 1,981,401; (2010) 2,571,593.  Geography  Most of the Moluccas are mountainous, although the Tanimbar and Aru island groups are low and swampy. Earthquakes are frequent, and several islands, especially Ternate and Banda , have active volcanoes . The climate of the Moluccas is tropical, with rainfall varying from 80 to 150 inches (2,000 to 3,800 mm) annually in various locations. Some of the land has been cleared for cultivation, but other areas remain covered with evergreen rainforest . There are patches of open savanna , and the coasts are often fringed with mangrove swamps. The Moluccas are a transition zone between Asian and Australian fauna and flora, and the animal life and vegetation of the islands include many species that are unique to the region.  The population of the islands is diverse , with the Ambonese, Butonese (people from the island of Buton in Southeast Sulawesi ), and Kai peoples together constituting roughly one-third of the islands’ residents in relatively equal numbers. Most of the remainder of the population consists of scores of smaller groups, many living in sparsely settled inland regions, as well a notable minority of Chinese descent, concentrated primarily in larger towns and urban areas. The principal cities of the Moluccas include Ambon (on the island of Ambon ), in the central region, and Ternate (on the island of Ternate ), in the north.  Similar Topics  Andaman Islands  Dozens of languages are spoken in the Moluccas, although Malay (of which the national language, Indonesian, is a dialect) has for centuries been used as a lingua franca ; in many areas, Malay has eclipsed local languages. Christianity (mostly Protestant ) and Islam are the dominant religions. A small but notable minority practices Hinduism or Buddhism , and some communities in the interior regions follow local religions. Except in northern Halmahera , Morotai , Ternate, Tidore, and several other areas of the northern Moluccas—where West Papuan languages are spoken—all languages spoken in the islands belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.  Most residents are engaged in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Rice, coconuts, and cocoa are widely grown, and fish, forest products, copra , and spices are among the most significant exports. Petroleum is mined in limited quantities, primarily on Ceram.  History  The cloves of the northern Moluccas and the nutmeg of the central islands were traded in Asia long before Europeans heard of the so-called Spice Islands . The Portuguese established themselves on the islands in 1512, beginning many decades of conflict that caused great losses of life. The first major confrontation was between the Portuguese and the reigning sultans of Ternate and Tidore ; later, the Spanish, English, and Dutch wrestled for control of the islands. Eventually, the Dutch emerged victorious, and they earned large profits from their enterprise in the Moluccas. By the end of the 18th century, however, the spice trade had greatly diminished, and the islands had become an economic backwater.

The creative musical theatre artists who were inspired by this painting drew the other characters in Act One from figures in the painting.  Looking Closely at Art  It would not be surprising to learn that Sondheim and Lapine used their own version of Visual Thinking Strategies to examine this painting that is 10 feet wide and 6 and a half feet tall.

In fact, it would be excellent to begin a study of this play by engaging students in doing precisely that – looking at an image of “Sunday Afternoon on the Island of la Grande Jatte” and asking them to respond to those questions.  What’s Going On? According to Sondheim and Lapine  The painting’s setting is the island of la Grande Jatte, which is located northwest of Paris in the Seine River. In 1884 (when Seurat began working on his painting), the island was a pastoral place where people could go to get away from city life. The musical’s creative artists pulled their characters from the canvas. Here’s a Who’s Who:  The most prominent figure is the woman in profile on the bottom right hand side.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Edith Cresson was born January 27, 1934, in a fashionable Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Her father was a senior civil servant. Raised by a British nanny, she became fluent in the English language. Cresson attended the School of Advanced Commercial Studies, earning a degree in business and later a doctorate in demography.  A successful businesswoman, she added a second career in politics when she met François Mitterrand in 1965. For the next 26 years the future president helped Cresson advance through the ranks of what is now the French Socialist Party, calling her "my little soldier."  After Mitterrand became president in 1981, Cresson served first as minister of agriculture (1981-1983), then as minister of external trade and tourism (1983-1984), as minister of industrial restructuring and external trade (1984-1986), and finally minister of foreign affairs (1988-1990). She resigned from the government on October 3, 1990, to work as a consultant on international development. Meanwhile she was three times elected a deputy to the National Assembly from the Vienne province (1981, 1986, 1988).  Then in May 1991, President Mitterrand asked Cresson to form a new government. Some experts believe Mitterand had grown dissatisfied with the failures of the government of Michel Rocard to gain majorities in the National Assembly.   Others believe the French president foresaw major international trade issues looming as the trans-European Union came into existence, and sought Cresson\'s expertise in trade affairs.  As prime minister, the combative Cresson planned to strengthen France\'s industrial power and to "protect" French and European trade from the inroads of Japanese and American products. In assembling her new cabinet of 29 members she chose a number of holdovers from the government of her predecessor. One, Pierre Brgovoy, was named to head a new superministry combining economic, trade, industrial, and technology affairs. His appointment served to restore trust in the French leadership in financial markets. She also appointed five women, three to posts in labor, development, and youth and sports.  When her appointment to prime minister drew misogynist remarks from some politicians of France\'s center and right parties, Cresson said, "Men are not in any sense irreplaceable except in one\'s private life." Nevertheless, more fair-minded criticism about her ability to command majorities in the National Assembly persisted.  The Cresson government moved aggressively to free what had become a stagnant economy, and on contentious domestic issues, frequently centered around immigrants. Quoted making strident and antagonistic comments about the Japanese "strategy of conquest," Cresson was greatly concerned over what she was convinced to be Japan\'s major threat to European trade and commonwealth. Diplomatically, her outspokenness was creating unease in international circles. Within four months of becoming president, the Cresson government had fallen precipitously in popularity. Subtle and not-so-subtle attacks on her gender continued, including a popular daytime television show featuring two puppet characters, one a sexy and servile female broadly seen as a Cresson parody. In April 1992, Cresson resigned. Since then she has served as Commissioner for Science, Research and Development to the European Commission.  Cresson\'s husband, Jacques, a retired executive of Peugeot, the French automobile and appliance company, remained supportive of his wife, and their relationship has been likened to that of Margaret Thatcher and her husband. Cresson has been compared to the British prime minister for her bluntness, energy, and stubbornness. They have two daughters.  Further Reading on Edith Cresson  The appointment and career of Cresson was covered in the Washington Post (May 16 and May 18, 1991). See also "An Iron Lady Across the Channel?"

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force.

The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.  Postcards from Paradise is officially out on March 31. For more on Ringo visit ringostarr.com .

Alexander Hamilton  Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation\'s financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and "The New York Post" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

Postcards From Paradise was produced by Ringo and recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles, and, as all his previous solo albums, features a little help from his friends and family. Among the contributors this time are Joe Walsh, Benmont Tench, Dave Stewart, Richard Marx, Peter Frampton, Nathan East, and Glen Ballard. Unlike previous Ringo recordings, however, Postcards includes one song, “Island in the Sun,” written and recorded by Ringo and all the members of his All Starr Band: Steve Lukather, Todd Rundgren, Gregg Rolie, Richard Page, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, who plays percussion, trumpet and steel drums on the track.  As usual, if you’re expecting a “drummy” album featuring crazy fills and odd time signatures, you’d be better off looking elsewhere. What you will get is Ringo having fun and laying down the formula that he’s perfected for the past fifty years, playing exactly what’s right for the song, no more and no less.  The album kicks off with “Rory and the Hurricanes,” a lyrical trip down memory lane going back to Ringo’s first band. On the title track Ringo and Rundgren pay tribute to the drummer’s next band—yup, the one he changed the world with—by creating the lyrics out of the titles of many of the Beatles’ most famous songs. Ringo, who also plays keyboards on this track, lays down the on-the-money groove we’ve all loved for so long, which is made even tastier by the amazing drum sound heard throughout the entire record. (Kudos to engineer Bruce Sugar.) The track “Touch and Go” will also touch a nerve with Beatle fans—you can practically see him bopping his head as he’s playing, as this track comes the closest on the record to a swinging “mop-top” beat.  On “You Bring the Party Down,” co-written with Toto’s Steve Lukather, Ringo goes back and forth between a reggae-like feel and a driving rock beat, adding well-timed timbale overdubs. (Like his past few releases, Ringo lays heavy on his reggae influence throughout, including on the tracks “Island in the Sun,” “Right Side of the Road,” and “Bridges.”) On “Bamboula,” Ringo lets loose on a syncopated New Orleans–inspired snare/tom rhythm, with more overdubbed percussion, while on the track “Confirmation” he plays a laid-back Motown groove. Then on “Let Love Lead,” he channels a Charlie Watts vibe and throws in a few unexpected upbeat cymbal crashes, and after the lead guitar break kicks into a snare/tom groove with a beautiful buzz roll.  Postcards from Paradise is officially out on March 31. For more on Ringo visit ringostarr.com .

He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: CarmenCarmen (;) is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected.

He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai).

Despite the  fact that Buff varieties are now bred in many breeds, the color probably has a  common source.  Oscar Grow believed that Buff in all breeds sprung from  Pomeranian or German stock.  Many British and European authorities would  disagree.  In my opinion the preponderance of evidence supports Mr. Grow.  As established types, Buff seems to have appeared first in  Pomeranian Saddle Back and the related solid Buff Celler Goose (often called  Buff Pomeranian outside Germany).  Other Buff geese can either be linked  directly or indirectly to this population, or at least display characteristics  that would seem to link them to an Eastern Graylag origin.  Only American and  Brecon Buff join the Celler Goose as Buff breeds.  Just as the Celler is really  a Pomeranian, the American Buff is basically a Buff morph of the historic  American Farm Goose.  The Brecon Buff closely resembles Pomeranians and  Americans in general size and type, but has a general refinement that is  unique.  In  Modern Waterfowl Management,  Oscar Grow says, "While  Buff plumage has long featured domestic goose bred in both the United States and  Europe, they have been a rather heterogeneous lot and left much to be desired  from a breeding standpoint."  According to Bruce Lentz, many of them had a  grayish tone and others ranged from pale to dark buff.  The main problem was  that almost all of them were female.  Much to Bruce\'s amusement prominent  breeders for years picked up buff specimens but failed to establish a pure buff  strain.  Bruce considered it a problem that "any chicken farmer worth his salt  could have figured out," but for decades nobody did.  Barbara Soames reports in  Keeping Domestic Geese  that part of the foundation stock for the  American Buff came "from Pomerania in 1900."  There were apparently a number of  imports over the first decade or so of the 20th century.  Bruce said they were  mostly ganders, a few saddle back and others of solid color.  Breeding these  ganders to American hens immediately established buff strains.  In the early  days most American Buff geese had pinkish red bills and legs, the Pomeranian  norm.  Some early American Buff hens sprang from Gray farm geese, but others  came from long established populations of German geese already in the United  States.  These German geese may have been the source of buff genes found in the  general Gray population.  The pinkish red bills and legs are recessive.  Bruce  and Young John Kriner tended to believe all Buffs originated from a single  mutation.  Dale Rice believed that was possible, but also felt it might be a  fairly simple mutation that had the chance of occurring frequently.  As a point of interest, Oscar Grow indicated that American Buff  geese were selected for the orange bill and feet trait because reddish pink had  never been popular in North America.  Bruce Lentz pointed out that such  extremities remained popular in areas of heavy German settlement and that  Americans simply wanted to distinguish their birds from the already established  German types.  Oscar Grow also mentions Saddle Back geese as a sub variety of  the American Buff.  I remember such birds well from my youth and they are still  around now, all too often being called Pomeranians.  With orange bills and legs  they should not be so easily mistaken.  English Buff geese and Buff Saddle Back  geese have been known for sometime but they were never common.  The Brecon Buff geese are at least as a recognized breed newer  than the American Buff geese.  Barbara Soames credits Sir Rhys Llewellyn with  first raising them in 1928.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.

Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: Cheeses of Germany and Austria - How To Cooking Tips ...Cheeses of Germany and Austria - How To Cooking Tips - RecipeTips.com  Cheeses of Germany and Austria  Cheeses of Germany and Austria  Allgauer Emmentaler  Allgauer Emmentaler is a German cow\'s milk cheese that is much like Swiss Emmental.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

They think it\'s all over - it is now!"

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

His works include the musical comedies Kiss Me, Kate, Fifty Million Frenchmen, DuBarry Was a Lady and Anything Goes, as well as songs like "Night and Day", "I Get a Kick out of You", "Well, Did You Evah!" and "I\'ve Got You Under My Skin". He was noted for his sophisticated bawdy lyrics, clever rhymes, and complex forms. He was one of the greatest contributors to the Great American Songbook. Cole Porter is one of the few Tin Pan Alley composers to have written both lyrics and music for his songs.  Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, to a wealthy Baptist family;[1] his maternal grandfather, James Omar "J.O." Cole, was a coal and timber speculator who dominated his daughter\'s family. His mother started Porter in musical training at an early age; he learned the violin at age six, the piano at eight, and he wrote his first operetta (with help from his mother) at 10. Porter\'s mother, Kate, recognized and supported her son\'s talents. She changed his legal birth year from 1891 to 1893 to make him appear more precocious. Porter\'s grandfather.  I Get a Kick Out of You"I Get a Kick out of You" is a song by Cole Porter, which was first sung in the 1934 Broadway musical Anything Goes, and then in the 1936 film version. Originally sung by Ethel Merman, it has been covered by dozens of prominent performers, including Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.  A cover in 1995 won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement with Accompanying Vocal(s) for arranger Rob McConnell.  Alterations to the song  The lyrics were first altered shortly after being written. The last verse originally went as follows:  I get no kick in a plane  I shouldn\'t care for those nights in the air  That the fair Mrs. Lindbergh goes through  But I get a kick out of you.  After the 1932 Lindbergh kidnapping,  Porter changed the second and third lines to:  Flying too high with some guy in the sky  Is my idea of nothing to do  In the 1936 movie version, alternative lyrics in the second verse were provided to replace a reference to the drug cocaine, which was not allowed by Hollywood\'s Production Code of 1934.   The original verse goes as follows:  Some get a kick from cocaine  I\'m sure that if  I took even one sniff  That would bore me terrif  ically, too  Yet, I get a | Question: "Which composer wrote ""Night and Day"", ""I Get a Kick out of You"", ""Well, Did You Evah!"" and ""I\'ve Got You Under My Skin""?" ?', ['cole porter', 'cole albert', 'cole albert porter'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3286'), ("Context: `` You Do n't Own Me '' is a popular song written by Philadelphia songwriters John Madara and David White and recorded by Lesley Gore in 1963 , when Gore was 17 years old .

10/01/2021 00:41:45 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: BagelA bagel ( \'; ), also spelled beigel,  is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: CarmenCarmen (;) is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected.

It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Despite the  fact that Buff varieties are now bred in many breeds, the color probably has a  common source.  Oscar Grow believed that Buff in all breeds sprung from  Pomeranian or German stock.  Many British and European authorities would  disagree.  In my opinion the preponderance of evidence supports Mr. Grow.  As established types, Buff seems to have appeared first in  Pomeranian Saddle Back and the related solid Buff Celler Goose (often called  Buff Pomeranian outside Germany).  Other Buff geese can either be linked  directly or indirectly to this population, or at least display characteristics  that would seem to link them to an Eastern Graylag origin.  Only American and  Brecon Buff join the Celler Goose as Buff breeds.  Just as the Celler is really  a Pomeranian, the American Buff is basically a Buff morph of the historic  American Farm Goose.  The Brecon Buff closely resembles Pomeranians and  Americans in general size and type, but has a general refinement that is  unique.  In  Modern Waterfowl Management,  Oscar Grow says, "While  Buff plumage has long featured domestic goose bred in both the United States and  Europe, they have been a rather heterogeneous lot and left much to be desired  from a breeding standpoint."  According to Bruce Lentz, many of them had a  grayish tone and others ranged from pale to dark buff.  The main problem was  that almost all of them were female.  Much to Bruce\'s amusement prominent  breeders for years picked up buff specimens but failed to establish a pure buff  strain.  Bruce considered it a problem that "any chicken farmer worth his salt  could have figured out," but for decades nobody did.  Barbara Soames reports in  Keeping Domestic Geese  that part of the foundation stock for the  American Buff came "from Pomerania in 1900."  There were apparently a number of  imports over the first decade or so of the 20th century.  Bruce said they were  mostly ganders, a few saddle back and others of solid color.  Breeding these  ganders to American hens immediately established buff strains.  In the early  days most American Buff geese had pinkish red bills and legs, the Pomeranian  norm.  Some early American Buff hens sprang from Gray farm geese, but others  came from long established populations of German geese already in the United  States.  These German geese may have been the source of buff genes found in the  general Gray population.  The pinkish red bills and legs are recessive.  Bruce  and Young John Kriner tended to believe all Buffs originated from a single  mutation.  Dale Rice believed that was possible, but also felt it might be a  fairly simple mutation that had the chance of occurring frequently.  As a point of interest, Oscar Grow indicated that American Buff  geese were selected for the orange bill and feet trait because reddish pink had  never been popular in North America.  Bruce Lentz pointed out that such  extremities remained popular in areas of heavy German settlement and that  Americans simply wanted to distinguish their birds from the already established  German types.  Oscar Grow also mentions Saddle Back geese as a sub variety of  the American Buff.  I remember such birds well from my youth and they are still  around now, all too often being called Pomeranians.  With orange bills and legs  they should not be so easily mistaken.  English Buff geese and Buff Saddle Back  geese have been known for sometime but they were never common.  The Brecon Buff geese are at least as a recognized breed newer  than the American Buff geese.  Barbara Soames credits Sir Rhys Llewellyn with  first raising them in 1928.  Actually, they were already found in their present  form on a Breconshire Hill farm.

Oregon Territory  The Territory of Oregon was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859, when the southwestern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Oregon.  Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), the region was divided between the UK and US in 1846.  When established, the territory encompassed an area that included the current states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces.

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

His mother started Porter in musical training at an early age; he learned the violin at age six, the piano at eight, and he wrote his first operetta (with help from his mother) at 10.

The decade was marked by sweeping social change and the domination of youth culture - baby boomers were growing up and demanded their own fashion style.  Designers responded with a much more liberal, daring approach to fashion, boasting colourful fabrics and bold designs.  The 1960s saw fashion reject the conventions and niceties of previous eras. Clothing broke with social traditions that dictated what could be worn when and by whom. In the past, attire had been divided in to 'formal' and 'casual' wear, and distinct separations were made between the styles of clothing worn by men and women. The 1960s, however, saw the emergence of unisex clothing such as denim jeans, which could be worn by both sexes.  1960s Mod fashion  Mod, short for 'modern', refers to a youth lifestyle that emerged from London during the 1960s, and quickly spread to America, Europe and Australia. Centred around London's thriving pop music, art and fashion scene, the mod lifestyle focused on innovation and the 'new'.  Mod fashion was slim fitting and featured bold geometric shapes. Colour was also a key concern - the conservative greys, browns and pastels of the 1950s were replaced by bright, wild hues. In contrast to fashion trends of the past, these garments were mass-produced and affordable.  Rising hemlines and the mini-skirt  The 1960s saw the appearance of the mini-skirt. Up until that time, skirts and dresses in Australia finished sensibly at the knee. New soaring hemlines created huge controversy when they first appeared, exposing centimetres of thigh never before seen in public.  At the Melbourne Cup in 1965, English model Jean Shrimpton created controversy by wearing a synthetic white shift dress with a hem high above her knees. She did not wear stockings, gloves or a hat. Shrimpton's outfit was considered scandalous, and made headlines around the world. By the end of the decade, however, shift dresses and mini-skirts had become widely accepted.  See Image 1  Mini-skirts represent more than just a fashion landmark of the decade - they have become an icon of the general culture of rebellion that characterised the 1960s. Young people were rejecting the social standards of the past and so too was their fashion. Many devotees of the feminist movement of the 1960s also saw the mini-skirt as a claim to the right of women to proudly display their bodies as they wished.  1960s Fashion icons  Throughout the 1960s, a number of famous people sported distinct fashion styles that were copied all over the world.  British teenage supermodel Leslie Hornby, also known as Twiggy due to her stick-thin figure, was a fashion idol to young girls everywhere. Her short, boyish haircut and leggy, waif-like frame graced the covers of every major fashion magazine.  While 1960s fashion was largely youth-driven, fashion icons also dictated the style of older women. Throughout her career, movie star Audrey Hepburn wore simple, flat shoes, three-quarter length pants, and plain black shift dresses. Her clothing style and her beehive hairdo, would be copied by millions of women worldwide.  See Image 2  Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of US President John F. Kennedy, became widely known for her beauty, grace and elegant style of dress. Her many public appearances popularised pearl necklaces, the pillbox hat (a small hat with a flat top and straight sides) and simple, big-buttoned suits.  1960s 'Hippie' fashion  Towards the end of the 1960s, the hippie movement had arrived in Australia.

The term "cinnamon" also refers to its mid-brown colour. While Cinnamomum verum is sometimes considered to be "true cinnamon", most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from related species, which are also referred to as "cassia" to distinguish them from "true cinnamon".   Cinnamon is the name for perhaps a dozen species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus Cinnamomum in the family Lauraceae. Only a few of them are grown commercially for spice.  Name   The English word "cinnamon", attested in English since the 15th century, derives from the Greek κιννάμωμον kinnámōmon (later kínnamon), via Latin and medieval French intermediate forms. The Greek was borrowed from a Phoenician word, which was akin to the related Hebrew qinnamon.   The name "cassia", first recorded in English around AD 1000, was borrowed via Latin and ultimately derives from Hebrew q\'tsīʿāh, a form of the verb qātsaʿ, "to strip off bark".   Early Modern English also used the names canel and canella, akin to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word cannella, a diminutive of canna, "tube", from the way the bark curls up as it dries.   History   In classical times, four types of cinnamon were distinguished (and often confused):  * True cinnamon , the bark of C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum) from Sri Lanka  * Malabathrum or malobathrum (from Sanskrit तमालपत्रम्,  tamālapattram, literally "dark-tree leaves"), several species including C. tamala from the north of India  * Serichatum, C. cassia from Seres, that is, China  * Cassia (Hebrew קציעה qəṣi`â), the bark of Cinnamomum iners from Arabia and Ethiopia, literally "the peel of the plant" which is scraped off the tree   Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who report it had come from China confuse it with cassia.  Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god; a fine inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of Apollo at Miletus.  Though its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the spice trade, to protect their monopoly as suppliers, cinnamon is native to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Malabar Coast of India, and Burma.  The first Greek reference to kasia is found in a poem by Sappho in the seventh century BC. According to Herodotus, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh, and ladanum, and were guarded by winged serpents. The phoenix was reputed to build its nest from cinnamon and cassia. Herodotus mentions other writers who believed the source of cassia was the home of Dionysos, located somewhere east or south of Greece.  The Greeks used kásia or malabathron to flavour wine, together with absinth wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). While Theophrastus gives a good account of the plants, he describes a curious method for harvesting: worms eat away the wood and leave the bark behind.  Egyptian recipes for kyphi, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia from Hellenistic times onward. The gifts of Hellenistic rulers to temples sometimes included cassia and cinnamon, as well as incense, myrrh, and Indian incense (kostos), so one might conclude that the Greeks used it for similar purposes.  The Hebrew Bible makes specific mention of the spice many times: first when Moses is commanded to use both sweet cinnamon (Hebrew: קִנָּמוֹן, qinnāmôn) and cassia in the holy anointing oil;  in Proverbs where the lover\'s bed is perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon;  and in Song of Solomon, a song describing the beauty of his beloved, cinnamon scents her garments like | Question: Nine tenths of the world\'s Cinnamon is produced on which island nation?

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.

One assumes Palin was attempting to say truth is an endangered species at the White House, which is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue is roughly a plaza in front of the Willard Hotel.  Palin is not the first politician to make this mistake. On Aug. 1, 2008, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, Republican from Texas, wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush, which he addressed to:  “The President  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, D.C. 20500”  I would like to imagine Conaway has spent the last six years wondering why he never received a response.  Out in the hallway of the Omni Shoreham, I talked to conservative women who felt that Palin’s mistake was not a big deal: “She speaks from the heart,” Marlea Knighton of Arizona, said. “The news never misprints?” Linda, an older lady from Virginia, said that anyone criticizing Palin for not knowing where the White House is located is just doing it “because they’re scared of what she says,” because women “who love the Lord” are intimidating to non-believers, like those populating the mainstream media.  Mark Roeske, who operates campaign buses, offered a different take: Conservative women like Palin intimidate feminist women because “they’re women who are not just a vagina,” and so they feel compelled to attack her whenever possible and make her seem stupid.  Gaffe aside, the rest of Palin’s speech was an unremarkable, nonsensical collection of Palinisms haphazardly strung together and delivered in her signature bright-yet-bitter-sounding sing-song style—like a homicidal kindergarten teacher.  “You’re the Americans that the media loves to hate,” she crooned, menacingly. And then, “All you mama grizzlies out there, rear up and charge against the lawless, imperial president and his failed liberal agenda and the lapdogs in the media.” And then, “So, I’m out in the shop with Todd, and he’s winterizing his snow plane.”  Let’s hope Todd has a better sense of direction.

The decade was marked by sweeping social change and the domination of youth culture - baby boomers were growing up and demanded their own fashion style.  Designers responded with a much more liberal, daring approach to fashion, boasting colourful fabrics and bold designs.  The 1960s saw fashion reject the conventions and niceties of previous eras. Clothing broke with social traditions that dictated what could be worn when and by whom. In the past, attire had been divided in to 'formal' and 'casual' wear, and distinct separations were made between the styles of clothing worn by men and women. The 1960s, however, saw the emergence of unisex clothing such as denim jeans, which could be worn by both sexes.  1960s Mod fashion  Mod, short for 'modern', refers to a youth lifestyle that emerged from London during the 1960s, and quickly spread to America, Europe and Australia. Centred around London's thriving pop music, art and fashion scene, the mod lifestyle focused on innovation and the 'new'.  Mod fashion was slim fitting and featured bold geometric shapes. Colour was also a key concern - the conservative greys, browns and pastels of the 1950s were replaced by bright, wild hues. In contrast to fashion trends of the past, these garments were mass-produced and affordable.  Rising hemlines and the mini-skirt  The 1960s saw the appearance of the mini-skirt. Up until that time, skirts and dresses in Australia finished sensibly at the knee. New soaring hemlines created huge controversy when they first appeared, exposing centimetres of thigh never before seen in public.  At the Melbourne Cup in 1965, English model Jean Shrimpton created controversy by wearing a synthetic white shift dress with a hem high above her knees. She did not wear stockings, gloves or a hat. Shrimpton's outfit was considered scandalous, and made headlines around the world. By the end of the decade, however, shift dresses and mini-skirts had become widely accepted.  See Image 1  Mini-skirts represent more than just a fashion landmark of the decade - they have become an icon of the general culture of rebellion that characterised the 1960s. Young people were rejecting the social standards of the past and so too was their fashion. Many devotees of the feminist movement of the 1960s also saw the mini-skirt as a claim to the right of women to proudly display their bodies as they wished.  1960s Fashion icons  Throughout the 1960s, a number of famous people sported distinct fashion styles that were copied all over the world.  British teenage supermodel Leslie Hornby, also known as Twiggy due to her stick-thin figure, was a fashion idol to young girls everywhere. Her short, boyish haircut and leggy, waif-like frame graced the covers of every major fashion magazine.  While 1960s fashion was largely youth-driven, fashion icons also dictated the style of older women. Throughout her career, movie star Audrey Hepburn wore simple, flat shoes, three-quarter length pants, and plain black shift dresses. Her clothing style and her beehive hairdo, would be copied by millions of women worldwide.  See Image 2  Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of US President John F. Kennedy, became widely known for her beauty, grace and elegant style of dress. Her many public appearances popularised pearl necklaces, the pillbox hat (a small hat with a flat top and straight sides) and simple, big-buttoned suits.  1960s 'Hippie' fashion  Towards the end of the 1960s, the hippie movement had arrived in Australia. Many young people had become dissatisfied with the prevailing mainstream social values, considering them to be shallow and materialistic.

The term "cinnamon" also refers to its mid-brown colour. While Cinnamomum verum is sometimes considered to be "true cinnamon", most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from related species, which are also referred to as "cassia" to distinguish them from "true cinnamon".   Cinnamon is the name for perhaps a dozen species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus Cinnamomum in the family Lauraceae. Only a few of them are grown commercially for spice.  Name   The English word "cinnamon", attested in English since the 15th century, derives from the Greek κιννάμωμον kinnámōmon (later kínnamon), via Latin and medieval French intermediate forms. The Greek was borrowed from a Phoenician word, which was akin to the related Hebrew qinnamon.   The name "cassia", first recorded in English around AD 1000, was borrowed via Latin and ultimately derives from Hebrew q\'tsīʿāh, a form of the verb qātsaʿ, "to strip off bark".   Early Modern English also used the names canel and canella, akin to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word cannella, a diminutive of canna, "tube", from the way the bark curls up as it dries.   History   In classical times, four types of cinnamon were distinguished (and often confused):  * True cinnamon , the bark of C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum) from Sri Lanka  * Malabathrum or malobathrum (from Sanskrit तमालपत्रम्,  tamālapattram, literally "dark-tree leaves"), several species including C. tamala from the north of India  * Serichatum, C. cassia from Seres, that is, China  * Cassia (Hebrew קציעה qəṣi`â), the bark of Cinnamomum iners from Arabia and Ethiopia, literally "the peel of the plant" which is scraped off the tree   Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who report it had come from China confuse it with cassia.  Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god; a fine inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of Apollo at Miletus.  Though its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the spice trade, to protect their monopoly as suppliers, cinnamon is native to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Malabar Coast of India, and Burma.  The first Greek reference to kasia is found in a poem by Sappho in the seventh century BC. According to Herodotus, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh, and ladanum, and were guarded by winged serpents. The phoenix was reputed to build its nest from cinnamon and cassia. Herodotus mentions other writers who believed the source of cassia was the home of Dionysos, located somewhere east or south of Greece.  The Greeks used kásia or malabathron to flavour wine, together with absinth wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). While Theophrastus gives a good account of the plants, he describes a curious method for harvesting: worms eat away the wood and leave the bark behind.  Egyptian recipes for kyphi, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia from Hellenistic times onward. The gifts of Hellenistic rulers to temples sometimes included cassia and cinnamon, as well as incense, myrrh, and Indian incense (kostos), so one might conclude that the Greeks used it for similar purposes.  The Hebrew Bible makes specific mention of the spice many times: first when Moses is commanded to use both sweet cinnamon (Hebrew: קִנָּמוֹן, qinnāmôn) and cassia in the holy anointing oil;  in Proverbs where the lover\'s bed is perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon;  and in Song of Solomon, a song describing the beauty of his beloved, cinnamon scents her garments like | Question: Nine tenths of the world\'s Cinnamon is produced on which island nation?

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.

Olivia Nuzzi  09.27.14 12:55 AM ET  Had John McCain been elected president in 2008, Sarah Palin still may not have ever set foot in the White House…because she wouldn’t have been able to find it.  On Friday afternoon, the failed reality-television star and one-time VP nominee materialized in Washington, clad in a leather blazer, to deliver a speech to the crowd at the Values Voter Summit—an annual social-conservative confab held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, a sprawling, gilded maze of a place that is rumored to be haunted by a dead maid.  Maybe she was the one screwing with Palin’s notes, because about halfway through her remarks, Palin said this: “Don’t retreat: You reload with truth, which I know is an endangered species at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue. Anyway, truth.”  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.  One assumes Palin was attempting to say truth is an endangered species at the White House, which is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue is roughly a plaza in front of the Willard Hotel.  Palin is not the first politician to make this mistake. On Aug. 1, 2008, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, Republican from Texas, wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush, which he addressed to:  “The President  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, D.C. 20500”  I would like to imagine Conaway has spent the last six years wondering why he never received a response.  Out in the hallway of the Omni Shoreham, I talked to conservative women who felt that Palin’s mistake was not a big deal: “She speaks from the heart,” Marlea Knighton of Arizona, said. “The news never misprints?” Linda, an older lady from Virginia, said that anyone criticizing Palin for not knowing where the White House is located is just doing it “because they’re scared of what she says,” because women “who love the Lord” are intimidating to non-believers, like those populating the mainstream media.  Mark Roeske, who operates campaign buses, offered a different take: Conservative women like Palin intimidate feminist women because “they’re women who are not just a vagina,” and so they feel compelled to attack her whenever possible and make her seem stupid.  Gaffe aside, the rest of Palin’s speech was an unremarkable, nonsensical collection of Palinisms haphazardly strung together and delivered in her signature bright-yet-bitter-sounding sing-song style—like a homicidal kindergarten teacher.  “You’re the Americans that the media loves to hate,” she crooned, menacingly. And then, “All you mama grizzlies out there, rear up and charge against the lawless, imperial president and his failed liberal agenda and the lapdogs in the media.” And then, “So, I’m out in the shop with Todd, and he’s winterizing his snow plane.”  Let’s hope Todd has a better sense of direction.

They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They\'ve threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn\'t a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like "real" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

He is also the former owner of the Messenger Group.   Early life  Eddy Shah was born in Cambridge. His mother was English and his father was Iranian. Shah was educated at the Scottish co-educational independent boarding school of Gordonstoun, and at both Haywards Heath Grammar School and Haywards Heath Secondary Modern School, at Haywards Heath in Sussex. He then attended a Brighton crammer, where he obtained seven GCE \'O\' Levels.  Shah held various jobs, amongst which was floor manager for Granada\'s television studio. After he was fired from the Manchester Evening News, he decided to launch into newspaper publishing on his own and started with the proceeds of £14,000 from the sale of his first home, in Sale, which he had bought for £4,000. reprinted by TMCnet  Publisher  As the owner of six local newspapers, Shah employed anti-trade union laws introduced by the Thatcher governments to defeat the print unions after national strikes that went on for seven months – despite receiving death threats. He was the first person to invoke Margaret Thatcher\'s anti-union laws to force the unions to the bargaining table. The Wapping dispute followed three years later.  Shah first confronted the trade unions at his Warrington print works and the Manchester news offices in 1983. As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994). After a break from writing, he returned in 2008 with a thriller entitled Second World.  Views on underage sex  In October 2012, he was charged with child sex offences allegedly committed in the 1990s. In December 2012, he denied six counts of rape involving a girl under 16.  The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.  In August 2013, he said that girls who throw themselves at celebrities or who "go out and just have a good time" could themselves be to blame. In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.  Shah\'s comments came directly after a prosecuting barrister was suspended following "inappropriate comments" concerning the rape of a 13-year-old.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat.

Byker Grove was the original idea of late TV executive Andrea Wonfor. In 1987, Andrea approached veteran soap writer Adele Rose. Together they created a single pilot episode featuring kids aged 8–11 at an out-of-school club (transmitted on Tyne Tees TV in 1988). In autumn 1988, Andrea got backing from Anna Home, then Head of drama, BBC TV. Anna gave the green light for a run of a series of six 25-minute episodes on BBC TV. The age of the main characters was raised to 12-16 after support from first producer-director, Matthew Robinson . The first series therefore centred on young teenagers crossing the bridge from childhood to adulthood. Although some of the action took place outside the youth club, the series was unusual among dramas in that the characters were rarely shown in school. One of the major settings was the foster home run by the kindly but strict Lou Gallagher, the longest-running character.  \xa0 Famous people  Byker Grove launched the careers of Anthony McPartlin ("P.J.") and Declan Donnelly ("Duncan") who are otherwise known as Ant & Dec as well as the actress Jill Halfpenny , Donna Air , former CBBC presenter Andrew Hayden-Smith and Emmerdale actors Dale Meeks , Charlie Hardwick and Victoria Hawkins . Also appearing in the series was the now glamour model Francoise Boufhal ("Ellie Baines"). Founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson who, after Byker Grove, became executive producer of EastEnders , Head of Drama BBC Wales and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia . It was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen Mamma Mia , the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham ( This Life , Doctor Who and co-creator of BBC One\'s Life on Mars ). The first writer was Adele Rose - in Series 1 she wrote eps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, her daughter, Carrie Rose, writing ep 5 - and the most prolific was Brian B. Thompson , who wrote 50 episodes over 12 series. Tom Hooper directed four episodes of the show in 1997. [1] Charlie Hunnam now stars in American TV series Sons of Anarchy .  \xa0 Production  \xa0 The Mitre , also known as Benwell Towers, acted as the production offices and the fictional youth club.  Byker Grove was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle . The actual youth club set was in Benwell , which is in the west area of the City, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne & Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the famous architecture that is the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) are used for filming backdrops.  The "youth club" building which is what the viewers see onscreen, known as The Mitre used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 90s) before it was bought by Zenith Television , who film the series. The building housed the actual set, production offices, make up suite and costume department. Currently the property is semi-vacant, and the Zenith North Television signs have been removed outside the building.  The final series started on 7 October 2006 on the CBBC Channel. Richard Deverell , head of CBBC, was interviewed on Newsround about the decision to axe Byker Grove. [2]  The eighteenth and last series of Byker Grove was produced by Tim Holloway, who also produced Casualty from 2000 until 2002.  On 11 March 2008, it was reported that Gallowgate Productions TV, the TV production company owned by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, purchased the rights to Byker Grove after the production company that made it ( Zenith Entertainment ) went into liquidation in 2007.

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva. This step was taken to avoid development of resistance and compromise the | Question: Artemisinin and derivatives are drugs found to act especially well on which disease?', ['falciparum malaria', 'malaria'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3595'), ("Context: James Dornan ( born 1 May 1982 ) is an actor , model , and musician from Northern Ireland .

They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They\'ve threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn\'t a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like "real" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

He is also the former owner of the Messenger Group.   Early life  Eddy Shah was born in Cambridge. His mother was English and his father was Iranian. Shah was educated at the Scottish co-educational independent boarding school of Gordonstoun, and at both Haywards Heath Grammar School and Haywards Heath Secondary Modern School, at Haywards Heath in Sussex. He then attended a Brighton crammer, where he obtained seven GCE \'O\' Levels.  Shah held various jobs, amongst which was floor manager for Granada\'s television studio. After he was fired from the Manchester Evening News, he decided to launch into newspaper publishing on his own and started with the proceeds of £14,000 from the sale of his first home, in Sale, which he had bought for £4,000. reprinted by TMCnet  Publisher  As the owner of six local newspapers, Shah employed anti-trade union laws introduced by the Thatcher governments to defeat the print unions after national strikes that went on for seven months – despite receiving death threats. He was the first person to invoke Margaret Thatcher\'s anti-union laws to force the unions to the bargaining table. The Wapping dispute followed three years later.  Shah first confronted the trade unions at his Warrington print works and the Manchester news offices in 1983. As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994).

The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.

In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).

Byker Grove was the original idea of late TV executive Andrea Wonfor. In 1987, Andrea approached veteran soap writer Adele Rose. Together they created a single pilot episode featuring kids aged 8–11 at an out-of-school club (transmitted on Tyne Tees TV in 1988). In autumn 1988, Andrea got backing from Anna Home, then Head of drama, BBC TV. Anna gave the green light for a run of a series of six 25-minute episodes on BBC TV. The age of the main characters was raised to 12-16 after support from first producer-director, Matthew Robinson . The first series therefore centred on young teenagers crossing the bridge from childhood to adulthood. Although some of the action took place outside the youth club, the series was unusual among dramas in that the characters were rarely shown in school. One of the major settings was the foster home run by the kindly but strict Lou Gallagher, the longest-running character.  \xa0 Famous people  Byker Grove launched the careers of Anthony McPartlin ("P.J.") and Declan Donnelly ("Duncan") who are otherwise known as Ant & Dec as well as the actress Jill Halfpenny , Donna Air , former CBBC presenter Andrew Hayden-Smith and Emmerdale actors Dale Meeks , Charlie Hardwick and Victoria Hawkins . Also appearing in the series was the now glamour model Francoise Boufhal ("Ellie Baines"). Founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson who, after Byker Grove, became executive producer of EastEnders , Head of Drama BBC Wales and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia . It was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen Mamma Mia , the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham ( This Life , Doctor Who and co-creator of BBC One\'s Life on Mars ). The first writer was Adele Rose - in Series 1 she wrote eps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, her daughter, Carrie Rose, writing ep 5 - and the most prolific was Brian B. Thompson , who wrote 50 episodes over 12 series. Tom Hooper directed four episodes of the show in 1997.

Byker Grove was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle . The actual youth club set was in Benwell , which is in the west area of the City, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne & Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the famous architecture that is the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) are used for filming backdrops.  The "youth club" building which is what the viewers see onscreen, known as The Mitre used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 90s) before it was bought by Zenith Television , who film the series. The building housed the actual set, production offices, make up suite and costume department.

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine. However, production and marketing of artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector of the endemic countries increases the chances of resistance to artemisnin. Due to this reason, WHO issued press release in January 2006 to stop the production of artemisinin monotherapies and was implemented in April 2006 at the WHO briefing on Malaria Treatment Guidelines and artemisinin monotherapies in Geneva. This step was taken to avoid development of resistance and compromise the | Question: Artemisinin and derivatives are drugs found to act especially well on which disease?', ['falciparum malaria', 'malaria'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3595'), ("Context: James Dornan ( born 1 May 1982 ) is an actor , model , and musician from Northern Ireland .

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb. Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films. A few years later, this kind of thing would be done better with WHERE EAGLES DARE. It's kind of hard to accept Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris as Norwegians, not surprisingly the Swedish Ulla Jacobsson (Bergman's SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT) is more convincing.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Discovered by space telescopes at some point between 2050 and 2077, Pandora has been the single most interesting thing to happen to the human race in hundreds of years. The news services love to run clips of the wild scenery on Pandora and its bizarre flora and fauna .  To the cultures of Earth , Pandora is mysterious, primal and terrifying. Even from orbit, the scope of florae present on the surface indicates a moon brimming with life. One of the creatures on Pandora is the direhorse , a gray-skinned, hexapodal horse-like animal with bioluminescent qualities that the Na\'vi ride when hunting. The Na\'vi also ride the mountain banshee to hunt from the air, but the hunter can become prey in the presence of the great leonopteryx . In the canopy below, other deadly yet exotic animals roam: vicious packs of viperwolves , thick skinned hammerhead titanotheres and the most fearsome creature of all, the thanator . Other than the richness of varying colors, the trees resemble those of Earth. They have the familiar trunks, branches and leaves, though due to the difference in gravity, many of the shapes appear strange to humans and the proportions are greater because of the lower gravity. The trees and plant life of Pandora have formed electrochemical connections between their roots and effectively act as neurons, creating a moon-wide "brain" that has achieved sentience, which is known to the Na\'vi as Eywa .  Pandora, despite being almost as large as Earth, is only a moon of the gas giant Polyphemus, which has thirteen other moons. However, due to the smaller size, its gravity is 20% less than Earth\'s. Due to Pandora\'s lower gravity, most creatures on Pandora are hexapods (six-legged), although the Na\'vi resemble humans and have only two legs. Creatures roam the air and forest canopy below, similar to Earth\'s animals, but on a scale several times larger. Pandora\'s wildlife also have bioluminescent qualities. Depending on the position of the various moons, Pandora can have two or even three moons in its sky at once. Pandora and the other moons cast large black shadows on Polyphemus.  Pandora looks like a lush paradise by Earth standards during the day, but at night, virtually all life on the moon exhibits bioluminescent qualities in various shades of blue, purple and green. This possibly explains the Na\'vi\'s blue skin color, which most likely provides them better camouflage at night on Pandora.  Contents  Edit  Pandora\'s atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (>18%), xenon (>5.5%), methane, and hydrogen sulfide (>1%) and is about 20% denser than the atmosphere on Earth primarily due to the high percentage of Xenon; a heavy, colourless, odourless, and generally unren active noble gas. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the Pandoran atmosphere makes it extremely poisonous to humans, rendering them unconscious in about 20 seconds and causing death in about 4 minutes when they venture out unprotected by specialized breathing masks. The hydrogen sulfide present is also quite poisonous; concentrations over 1000 ppm (0.1\xa0%) can cause immediate collapse with subsequent loss of breathing, even after inhalation of a single breath.  The increased air resistance within this denser atmosphere has a number of effects:  Lower terminal velocity. Combined with Pandora\'s twenty-percent lower gravity, a freely falling object\'s maximum speed is significantly less than on earth. A Na\'vi who happens to fall from a flying mountain banshee has a good chance of surviving uninjured if they are over a forested area. Even over water, falling spread-eagled can reduce their speed sufficiently to allow an impact with the surface that will not knock them unconscious.

When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

He is also the former owner of the Messenger Group.   Early life  Eddy Shah was born in Cambridge. His mother was English and his father was Iranian. Shah was educated at the Scottish co-educational independent boarding school of Gordonstoun, and at both Haywards Heath Grammar School and Haywards Heath Secondary Modern School, at Haywards Heath in Sussex. He then attended a Brighton crammer, where he obtained seven GCE \'O\' Levels.  Shah held various jobs, amongst which was floor manager for Granada\'s television studio. After he was fired from the Manchester Evening News, he decided to launch into newspaper publishing on his own and started with the proceeds of £14,000 from the sale of his first home, in Sale, which he had bought for £4,000. reprinted by TMCnet  Publisher  As the owner of six local newspapers, Shah employed anti-trade union laws introduced by the Thatcher governments to defeat the print unions after national strikes that went on for seven months – despite receiving death threats. He was the first person to invoke Margaret Thatcher\'s anti-union laws to force the unions to the bargaining table. The Wapping dispute followed three years later.  Shah first confronted the trade unions at his Warrington print works and the Manchester news offices in 1983. As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994). After a break from writing, he returned in 2008 with a thriller entitled Second World.  Views on underage sex  In October 2012, he was charged with child sex offences allegedly committed in the 1990s. In December 2012, he denied six counts of rape involving a girl under 16.  The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.  In August 2013, he said that girls who throw themselves at celebrities or who "go out and just have a good time" could themselves be to blame. In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.  Shah\'s comments came directly after a prosecuting barrister was suspended following "inappropriate comments" concerning the rape of a 13-year-old.   Personal life  Shah is married to actress Jennifer White Shah, whom he first met while he was working for Granada Television.

Chatham also has military connections; several Army barracks were located here, together with 19th century forts which provided a defensive shield for the dockyard. Brompton Barracks, located in the town, remains the headquarters of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The town has important road links and the railway and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area. It is the administrative headquarters of Medway unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping center. The Treasurer of the Navy's accounts of the King's Exchequer for the year of 1544 identifies Deptford as the Dockyard that carried out all the major repairs to the King's Ships that year.  That was soon to change, although Deptford remained a dockyard for over three centuries.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic.

Early life  Born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, Yates  was brought up in a show business family. Her mother was Elaine Smith, a former showgirl, actress and writer of erotic novels, who used the stage name Heller Toren. Until late in her life, Yates believed her biological father to be Jess Yates, who hosted the ITV religious programme Stars on Sunday. Jess Yates and Elaine Smith were married from 1958 to 1975. Jess Yates was sixteen years older than his wife, and their marriage was unconventional.  In an unsettled childhood, Paula attended school at Rowen Primary School, Penrhos College, Ysgol Aberconwy. The Yates family ran the Deganwy Castle Hotel for a time, before moving to a large house in Rowen, Conwy. After the break-up of her parents\' marriage in 1975, Paula lived mostly with her mother, including periods in Malta and Mallorca where she was a pupil at Bellver International College, before returning to Britain.  Career  In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called "Natural Blonde" in the Record Mirror, shortly after posing for Penthouse magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme The Tube. She also appeared alongside friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof \'mockumentary\' on Bananarama.  In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin\'".   After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood.  Yates continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show The Tube. She became most notorious for her "on the bed" interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof.  On 27 October 1995, Yates appeared on the quiz programme Have I Got News for You and clashed with Ian Hislop over comments he had previously made about her breast enlargement surgery.  Yates referred to Hislop as "the sperm of the devil", to which Hislop replied, "Even your insults emanate from the genitals!"  Personal life  Yates met Geldof in the early days of the Boomtown Rats. They became a couple in 1976 when she flew to Paris to surprise him while the band was playing there. Their first daughter, Fifi Trixibelle, was born on 31 March 1983,  named Fifi after Bob\'s aunt Fifi and Trixibelle because Paula wanted a belle in the family.  After ten years together, they married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran acting as Geldof\'s best man.

Yates first met Michael Hutchence in a 1985 interview on Channel 4\'s rock magazine programme The Tube.  During this appearance on The Tube, Yates was reportedly asked to leave Hutchence alone by the road manager of INXS when Paula walked up to him and said, "I\'m going to have that boy." Paula was unmoved and began to show up at INXS gigs everywhere for the next few years...she even brought her daughter (Fifi Geldof).

Olivia Nuzzi  09.27.14 12:55 AM ET  Had John McCain been elected president in 2008, Sarah Palin still may not have ever set foot in the White House…because she wouldn’t have been able to find it.  On Friday afternoon, the failed reality-television star and one-time VP nominee materialized in Washington, clad in a leather blazer, to deliver a speech to the crowd at the Values Voter Summit—an annual social-conservative confab held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, a sprawling, gilded maze of a place that is rumored to be haunted by a dead maid.  Maybe she was the one screwing with Palin’s notes, because about halfway through her remarks, Palin said this: “Don’t retreat: You reload with truth, which I know is an endangered species at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue. Anyway, truth.”  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.  One assumes Palin was attempting to say truth is an endangered species at the White House, which is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue is roughly a plaza in front of the Willard Hotel.  Palin is not the first politician to make this mistake. On Aug. 1, 2008, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, Republican from Texas, wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush, which he addressed to:  “The President  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, D.C. 20500”  I would like to imagine Conaway has spent the last six years wondering why he never received a response.  Out in the hallway of the Omni Shoreham, I talked to conservative women who felt that Palin’s mistake was not a big deal: “She speaks from the heart,” Marlea Knighton of Arizona, said. “The news never misprints?” Linda, an older lady from Virginia, said that anyone criticizing Palin for not knowing where the White House is located is just doing it “because they’re scared of what she says,” because women “who love the Lord” are intimidating to non-believers, like those populating the mainstream media.  Mark Roeske, who operates campaign buses, offered a different take: Conservative women like Palin intimidate feminist women because “they’re women who are not just a vagina,” and so they feel compelled to attack her whenever possible and make her seem stupid.  Gaffe aside, the rest of Palin’s speech was an unremarkable, nonsensical collection of Palinisms haphazardly strung together and delivered in her signature bright-yet-bitter-sounding sing-song style—like a homicidal kindergarten teacher.  “You’re the Americans that the media loves to hate,” she crooned, menacingly. And then, “All you mama grizzlies out there, rear up and charge against the lawless, imperial president and his failed liberal agenda and the lapdogs in the media.” And then, “So, I’m out in the shop with Todd, and he’s winterizing his snow plane.”  Let’s hope Todd has a better sense of direction.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Discovered by space telescopes at some point between 2050 and 2077, Pandora has been the single most interesting thing to happen to the human race in hundreds of years. The news services love to run clips of the wild scenery on Pandora and its bizarre flora and fauna .  To the cultures of Earth , Pandora is mysterious, primal and terrifying. Even from orbit, the scope of florae present on the surface indicates a moon brimming with life. One of the creatures on Pandora is the direhorse , a gray-skinned, hexapodal horse-like animal with bioluminescent qualities that the Na\'vi ride when hunting. The Na\'vi also ride the mountain banshee to hunt from the air, but the hunter can become prey in the presence of the great leonopteryx . In the canopy below, other deadly yet exotic animals roam: vicious packs of viperwolves , thick skinned hammerhead titanotheres and the most fearsome creature of all, the thanator . Other than the richness of varying colors, the trees resemble those of Earth. They have the familiar trunks, branches and leaves, though due to the difference in gravity, many of the shapes appear strange to humans and the proportions are greater because of the lower gravity. The trees and plant life of Pandora have formed electrochemical connections between their roots and effectively act as neurons, creating a moon-wide "brain" that has achieved sentience, which is known to the Na\'vi as Eywa .  Pandora, despite being almost as large as Earth, is only a moon of the gas giant Polyphemus, which has thirteen other moons. However, due to the smaller size, its gravity is 20% less than Earth\'s. Due to Pandora\'s lower gravity, most creatures on Pandora are hexapods (six-legged), although the Na\'vi resemble humans and have only two legs. Creatures roam the air and forest canopy below, similar to Earth\'s animals, but on a scale several times larger. Pandora\'s wildlife also have bioluminescent qualities. Depending on the position of the various moons, Pandora can have two or even three moons in its sky at once. Pandora and the other moons cast large black shadows on Polyphemus.  Pandora looks like a lush paradise by Earth standards during the day, but at night, virtually all life on the moon exhibits bioluminescent qualities in various shades of blue, purple and green. This possibly explains the Na\'vi\'s blue skin color, which most likely provides them better camouflage at night on Pandora.  Contents  Edit  Pandora\'s atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide (>18%), xenon (>5.5%), methane, and hydrogen sulfide (>1%) and is about 20% denser than the atmosphere on Earth primarily due to the high percentage of Xenon; a heavy, colourless, odourless, and generally unren active noble gas. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the Pandoran atmosphere makes it extremely poisonous to humans, rendering them unconscious in about 20 seconds and causing death in about 4 minutes when they venture out unprotected by specialized breathing masks. The hydrogen sulfide present is also quite poisonous; concentrations over 1000 ppm (0.1\xa0%) can cause immediate collapse with subsequent loss of breathing, even after inhalation of a single breath.

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

He is also the former owner of the Messenger Group.   Early life  Eddy Shah was born in Cambridge. His mother was English and his father was Iranian. Shah was educated at the Scottish co-educational independent boarding school of Gordonstoun, and at both Haywards Heath Grammar School and Haywards Heath Secondary Modern School, at Haywards Heath in Sussex. He then attended a Brighton crammer, where he obtained seven GCE \'O\' Levels.  Shah held various jobs, amongst which was floor manager for Granada\'s television studio. After he was fired from the Manchester Evening News, he decided to launch into newspaper publishing on his own and started with the proceeds of £14,000 from the sale of his first home, in Sale, which he had bought for £4,000. reprinted by TMCnet  Publisher  As the owner of six local newspapers, Shah employed anti-trade union laws introduced by the Thatcher governments to defeat the print unions after national strikes that went on for seven months – despite receiving death threats. He was the first person to invoke Margaret Thatcher\'s anti-union laws to force the unions to the bargaining table. The Wapping dispute followed three years later.  Shah first confronted the trade unions at his Warrington print works and the Manchester news offices in 1983. As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994). After a break from writing, he returned in 2008 with a thriller entitled Second World.  Views on underage sex  In October 2012, he was charged with child sex offences allegedly committed in the 1990s. In December 2012, he denied six counts of rape involving a girl under 16.  The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.  In August 2013, he said that girls who throw themselves at celebrities or who "go out and just have a good time" could themselves be to blame. In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.  Shah\'s comments came directly after a prosecuting barrister was suspended following "inappropriate comments" concerning the rape of a 13-year-old.

Chatham also has military connections; several Army barracks were located here, together with 19th century forts which provided a defensive shield for the dockyard. Brompton Barracks, located in the town, remains the headquarters of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The town has important road links and the railway and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area. It is the administrative headquarters of Medway unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping center. The Treasurer of the Navy's accounts of the King's Exchequer for the year of 1544 identifies Deptford as the Dockyard that carried out all the major repairs to the King's Ships that year.  That was soon to change, although Deptford remained a dockyard for over three centuries.

Chatham was established as a royal dockyard by Elizabeth I in 1567. She herself visited the yard in 1573. By the late 17th century it was the largest refitting dockyard and very important during the Dutch wars.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.  Sanguinarine is used in some tooth-pastes and mouth rinses for its anti-plaque activity, but is no longer considered safe for prolonged use.

Early life  Born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, Yates  was brought up in a show business family. Her mother was Elaine Smith, a former showgirl, actress and writer of erotic novels, who used the stage name Heller Toren. Until late in her life, Yates believed her biological father to be Jess Yates, who hosted the ITV religious programme Stars on Sunday. Jess Yates and Elaine Smith were married from 1958 to 1975. Jess Yates was sixteen years older than his wife, and their marriage was unconventional.  In an unsettled childhood, Paula attended school at Rowen Primary School, Penrhos College, Ysgol Aberconwy. The Yates family ran the Deganwy Castle Hotel for a time, before moving to a large house in Rowen, Conwy. After the break-up of her parents\' marriage in 1975, Paula lived mostly with her mother, including periods in Malta and Mallorca where she was a pupil at Bellver International College, before returning to Britain.  Career  In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called "Natural Blonde" in the Record Mirror, shortly after posing for Penthouse magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme The Tube. She also appeared alongside friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof \'mockumentary\' on Bananarama.  In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin\'".   After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood.  Yates continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show The Tube. She became most notorious for her "on the bed" interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof.  On 27 October 1995, Yates appeared on the quiz programme Have I Got News for You and clashed with Ian Hislop over comments he had previously made about her breast enlargement surgery.  Yates referred to Hislop as "the sperm of the devil", to which Hislop replied, "Even your insults emanate from the genitals!"  Personal life  Yates met Geldof in the early days of the Boomtown Rats. They became a couple in 1976 when she flew to Paris to surprise him while the band was playing there. Their first daughter, Fifi Trixibelle, was born on 31 March 1983,  named Fifi after Bob\'s aunt Fifi and Trixibelle because Paula wanted a belle in the family.  After ten years together, they married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran acting as Geldof\'s best man. The couple then had two more daughters, Peaches Geldof  on 13 March 1989, and Pixie Geldof on 17 September 1990.  Yates first met Michael Hutchence in a 1985 interview on Channel 4\'s rock magazine programme The Tube.  During this appearance on The Tube, Yates was reportedly asked to leave Hutchence alone by the road manager of INXS when Paula walked up to him and said, "I\'m going to have that boy." Paula was unmoved and began to show up at INXS gigs everywhere for the next few years...she even brought her daughter (Fifi Geldof).  Yates maintained irregular contact with Hutchence during the intervening nine years and their affair had been underway long before the Big Breakfast interview.  In February 1995, Yates left Geldof.  Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996. Yates\'s daughter with Hutchence, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence (known as \'Tiger\') was born on 22 July 1996.   On 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in a hotel room in Sydney. Paula Yates wrote in her police statement that Michael Hutchence was "frightened and couldn\'t stand a minute more without his baby."

Olivia Nuzzi  09.27.14 12:55 AM ET  Had John McCain been elected president in 2008, Sarah Palin still may not have ever set foot in the White House…because she wouldn’t have been able to find it.  On Friday afternoon, the failed reality-television star and one-time VP nominee materialized in Washington, clad in a leather blazer, to deliver a speech to the crowd at the Values Voter Summit—an annual social-conservative confab held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, a sprawling, gilded maze of a place that is rumored to be haunted by a dead maid.  Maybe she was the one screwing with Palin’s notes, because about halfway through her remarks, Palin said this: “Don’t retreat: You reload with truth, which I know is an endangered species at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue. Anyway, truth.”  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue.  One assumes Palin was attempting to say truth is an endangered species at the White House, which is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue is roughly a plaza in front of the Willard Hotel.  Palin is not the first politician to make this mistake. On Aug. 1, 2008, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, Republican from Texas, wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush, which he addressed to:  “The President  1400 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, D.C. 20500”  I would like to imagine Conaway has spent the last six years wondering why he never received a response.  Out in the hallway of the Omni Shoreham, I talked to conservative women who felt that Palin’s mistake was not a big deal: “She speaks from the heart,” Marlea Knighton of Arizona, said. “The news never misprints?” Linda, an older lady from Virginia, said that anyone criticizing Palin for not knowing where the White House is located is just doing it “because they’re scared of what she says,” because women “who love the Lord” are intimidating to non-believers, like those populating the mainstream media.  Mark Roeske, who operates campaign buses, offered a different take: Conservative women like Palin intimidate feminist women because “they’re women who are not just a vagina,” and so they feel compelled to attack her whenever possible and make her seem stupid.  Gaffe aside, the rest of Palin’s speech was an unremarkable, nonsensical collection of Palinisms haphazardly strung together and delivered in her signature bright-yet-bitter-sounding sing-song style—like a homicidal kindergarten teacher.  “You’re the Americans that the media loves to hate,” she crooned, menacingly. And then, “All you mama grizzlies out there, rear up and charge against the lawless, imperial president and his failed liberal agenda and the lapdogs in the media.” And then, “So, I’m out in the shop with Todd, and he’s winterizing his snow plane.”  Let’s hope Todd has a better sense of direction.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."

On the day of the race he was a 100-1 outsider but the day before he had a 500-1 chance! In fact so bad were his chances that neither his owner or trainer actually attended Aintree on the day to see him race – and if the trainer and the owner don’t believe in you then who is going to?  The general consensus of Foinavon’s poor status was summed up by Daily Express tipster Charles Benson who said at the time: ‘Not the boldest of jumpers, he can be safely ignored, even in a race noted for shocks.’ You can imagine the payouts for those who were crazy (or inspired) enough to bet on him – coming home a winner by fifteen lengths, his success paid out a record 444-1 on the Tote.  Foinavon’s win was a prime example of how the Grand National can throw at you exactly what wasn’t expected. Things had been pretty plain sailing for more than the first half of the race with more than thirty of the forty-four runners getting past the second Becher’s (an accident blackspot if ever there was one). The next fence, the smallest on the course at just four foot six, is where things went wrong for the majority of the competitors, with all of them going down bar Foinavon most notably because he was so far behind the rest of the field.  The pile-up and mayhem was due to the fact that a blinkered Popham Down, who was riderless since the first fence, refused the jump and instead stopped dead to rights in front of the fence meaning that all the subsequent horses ended up crashing into each other. In fact most of the runners ended up flinging their jockey’s over the fence instead. In the words of Lord Oaksey (then rider John Lawrence) Popham Down had: ‘cut down the leaders like a row of thistles.’  Ridden by John Buckingham, Foinavon had, prior to the pandemonium been a hundred yards behind the leaders and upon seeing the chaos ahead, managed to steer wide to the outside and through a gap between loose horses cleared the fence at the first attempt. This gave him a clear hundred yard advantage of the seventeen jockeys that had managed to re-mount and remain in pursuit. All to no avail though – destiny had taken over and Foinavon won comfortably from Honey End, the 15-2 favourite and Red Alligator, who won the race the following year, finished third.  While some condemned the 1967 race as being a farce, the nature of the race – sensational, exciting and injury-free – instilled a newfound respect and demand to ‘save the National’, which was much needed given that at the time Aintree was under threat of sale for building development.  Perhaps unsurprisingly Foinavon did not go on to win another National, but he did have another freak win when at Uttoexeter in October 1968 he trailed home alone after another loose horse brought down the race leader and caused the only other runner to be carried out. Dubbed ‘the National’s luckiest winner ’ Foinavon remains legendary at Aintree with the four foot six fence after Becher’s Brook, where the pile-up of horses occurred following Popham Down’s cut through, named after him.  Only recently has author David Owen managed to eloquently sum up that great day and indeed the story of Foinavon’s life in his new book Foinavon: The Story of the Grand National’s Biggest Upset. It is published by Wisden Sports Writing and has received rave reviews for it’s original, detailed and insightful view of race.

Reuters/Jim Young +  By Martyn Herman | WHISTLER  WHISTLER Amy Williams roared to Britain\'s first Olympic gold medal in an individual winter event since 1980 in the women\'s skeleton on Friday but had an anxious wait before Canada had an appeal against her helmet rejected.  The Canadians, whose own gold medal hope Mellisa Hollingsworth finished a tearful fifth, followed an earlier failed U.S. appeal against Williams\'s helmet which they said had illegal aerodynamic features.  Maybe the hosts were just bamboozled by the speed of Williams who had never won a World Cup race despite a silver medal the 2009 world championships.  The ice cool Queen of Speed smashed the women\'s course record on Thursday to hold the midway lead and went even faster in heat three with a new record of 53.68 to widen the gap to the chasing pack led by favorite Hollingsworth.  With a healthy 0.52-second cushion going into her fourth and final slide, Williams kept it clean through the 16 unforgiving curves to match the feat of Briton Robin Cousins who won the men\'s figure skating title in Lake Placid 30 years ago.  SPORTING HEROINE  "It\'s amazing, I feel like I\'m in a little bubble and not sure if it\'s real or not," the curly-haired Williams told Reuters as fans, some dressed as St George, waved Union Jacks in the grandstand and toasted their new sporting heroine.  "I knew I had to just keep it together. I can\'t remember what I did on the last run, half of the track is just a blur."  Hollingsworth\'s gold medal dream ended in despair when she crunched into a wall in the middle of her final run meaning Germany\'s Kerstin Szymkowiak took the silver, 0.56 seconds behind Williams, and compatriot Anja Huber the bronze.  "It is just really hard," Hollingsworth, this season\'s World Cup winner, said, tears streaking her red cheeks.  "I feel like I have let my entire country down. It could have happened anywhere, at a World Cup ... but it happened at the Olympic Games."  Williams, on a sled she calls Arthur, was unstoppable in all four runs, leading from start to finish, to become Britain\'s first gold medalist in a sliding sport since Anthony Nash and Robin Dixon in the two-man bobsleigh in 1964.  Former rower Steve Redgrave, Britain\'s most decorated Olympian, greeted Williams after her final slide to glory.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy.

They called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the name, whose precise origin is contested, nevertheless indicates the chief source of their inspiration. Disenchanted with contemporary academic painting—most of them were colleagues at the Royal Academy of Art and famously disparaged the Academy’s founding president, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), as “Sir Sloshua”—the Brotherhood instead emulated the art of late medieval and early Renaissance Europe until the time of Raphael, an art characterized by minute description of detail, a luminous palette of bright colors that recalls the tempera paint used by medieval artists, and subject matter of a noble, religious, or moralizing nature. In mid-nineteenth-century England, a period marked by political upheaval, mass industrialization, and social ills, the Brotherhood at its inception strove to transmit a message of artistic renewal and moral reform by imbuing their art with seriousness, sincerity, and truth to nature.  At London’s Royal Academy and Free Exhibition shows of 1849, several paintings were exhibited with the cryptic initials “P.R.B.” along with the artists’ signatures; among these were Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother, Slain in a Skirmish between the Colonna and Orsini Factions (private collection) by William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Isabella (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) by John Everett Millais (1829–1896), and the Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate, London) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). These canvases, though diverse in subject, embodied the Brotherhood’s initial aims in their keen observation of the natural world and depiction of subjects that lead the viewer to contemplate moral issues of justice, piety, familial relationships, and the struggle of purity against corruption.  Hunt’s work illustrates a passage from a popular Victorian novel, set in fourteenth-century Rome, by Bulwer Lytton, and is characterized by a careful description of the outdoor setting. Millais’ Isabella is based on John Keats’ retelling of a story from Boccaccio’s Decameron; the artist re-creates in sumptuous detail the tastes and textures of a medieval banquet, from the creased tablecloth strewn with nutshells to guests at the grandly arrayed gathering. In his portrayal of the life of the Virgin, Rossetti employs an archaizing style and symbolic elements associated with early Renaissance painting: the lily , representing purity, the dove of the Holy Spirit, and the cruciform trellis. Other founding members of the Brotherhood—James Collinson (1825–1881; he resigned after converting to Catholicism in 1850), William Michael Rossetti (1829–1919), Frederic George Stephens (1827–1907), and the sculptor Thomas Woolner (1825–1892)—exhibited less frequently than its three prolific leading members.  The works of the Pre-Raphaelites met with critical opposition to their pietism, archaizing compositions, intensely sharp focus—which, with an absence of shadows, flattened the depicted forms—and the stark coloration they achieved by painting on a wet white ground. They had, however, several important champions.

Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) .

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result.

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

The ESZ catalalogue of modern Italian composers active since the 1970s is extensive.  ESZ also publishes the bulletin “ESZ News” with information on the activities and performances of its composers.  Until 1999 ESZ published "Il Fronimo", the guitar magazine founded by Ruggero Chiesa in 1972, and "La Cartellina", a magazine on choral and pedagogical music, founded by Roberto Goitre in 1977 and subsequently headed by Giovanni Acciai.

On the day of the race he was a 100-1 outsider but the day before he had a 500-1 chance! In fact so bad were his chances that neither his owner or trainer actually attended Aintree on the day to see him race – and if the trainer and the owner don’t believe in you then who is going to?  The general consensus of Foinavon’s poor status was summed up by Daily Express tipster Charles Benson who said at the time: ‘Not the boldest of jumpers, he can be safely ignored, even in a race noted for shocks.’ You can imagine the payouts for those who were crazy (or inspired) enough to bet on him – coming home a winner by fifteen lengths, his success paid out a record 444-1 on the Tote.  Foinavon’s win was a prime example of how the Grand National can throw at you exactly what wasn’t expected. Things had been pretty plain sailing for more than the first half of the race with more than thirty of the forty-four runners getting past the second Becher’s (an accident blackspot if ever there was one). The next fence, the smallest on the course at just four foot six, is where things went wrong for the majority of the competitors, with all of them going down bar Foinavon most notably because he was so far behind the rest of the field.  The pile-up and mayhem was due to the fact that a blinkered Popham Down, who was riderless since the first fence, refused the jump and instead stopped dead to rights in front of the fence meaning that all the subsequent horses ended up crashing into each other. In fact most of the runners ended up flinging their jockey’s over the fence instead. In the words of Lord Oaksey (then rider John Lawrence) Popham Down had: ‘cut down the leaders like a row of thistles.’  Ridden by John Buckingham, Foinavon had, prior to the pandemonium been a hundred yards behind the leaders and upon seeing the chaos ahead, managed to steer wide to the outside and through a gap between loose horses cleared the fence at the first attempt. This gave him a clear hundred yard advantage of the seventeen jockeys that had managed to re-mount and remain in pursuit. All to no avail though – destiny had taken over and Foinavon won comfortably from Honey End, the 15-2 favourite and Red Alligator, who won the race the following year, finished third.  While some condemned the 1967 race as being a farce, the nature of the race – sensational, exciting and injury-free – instilled a newfound respect and demand to ‘save the National’, which was much needed given that at the time Aintree was under threat of sale for building development.  Perhaps unsurprisingly Foinavon did not go on to win another National, but he did have another freak win when at Uttoexeter in October 1968 he trailed home alone after another loose horse brought down the race leader and caused the only other runner to be carried out. Dubbed ‘the National’s luckiest winner ’ Foinavon remains legendary at Aintree with the four foot six fence after Becher’s Brook, where the pile-up of horses occurred following Popham Down’s cut through, named after him.  Only recently has author David Owen managed to eloquently sum up that great day and indeed the story of Foinavon’s life in his new book Foinavon: The Story of the Grand National’s Biggest Upset. It is published by Wisden Sports Writing and has received rave reviews for it’s original, detailed and insightful view of race.

Reuters/Jim Young +  By Martyn Herman | WHISTLER  WHISTLER Amy Williams roared to Britain\'s first Olympic gold medal in an individual winter event since 1980 in the women\'s skeleton on Friday but had an anxious wait before Canada had an appeal against her helmet rejected.  The Canadians, whose own gold medal hope Mellisa Hollingsworth finished a tearful fifth, followed an earlier failed U.S. appeal against Williams\'s helmet which they said had illegal aerodynamic features.  Maybe the hosts were just bamboozled by the speed of Williams who had never won a World Cup race despite a silver medal the 2009 world championships.  The ice cool Queen of Speed smashed the women\'s course record on Thursday to hold the midway lead and went even faster in heat three with a new record of 53.68 to widen the gap to the chasing pack led by favorite Hollingsworth.  With a healthy 0.52-second cushion going into her fourth and final slide, Williams kept it clean through the 16 unforgiving curves to match the feat of Briton Robin Cousins who won the men\'s figure skating title in Lake Placid 30 years ago.  SPORTING HEROINE  "It\'s amazing, I feel like I\'m in a little bubble and not sure if it\'s real or not," the curly-haired Williams told Reuters as fans, some dressed as St George, waved Union Jacks in the grandstand and toasted their new sporting heroine.  "I knew I had to just keep it together. I can\'t remember what I did on the last run, half of the track is just a blur."  Hollingsworth\'s gold medal dream ended in despair when she crunched into a wall in the middle of her final run meaning Germany\'s Kerstin Szymkowiak took the silver, 0.56 seconds behind Williams, and compatriot Anja Huber the bronze.  "It is just really hard," Hollingsworth, this season\'s World Cup winner, said, tears streaking her red cheeks.  "I feel like I have let my entire country down. It could have happened anywhere, at a World Cup ... but it happened at the Olympic Games."  Williams, on a sled she calls Arthur, was unstoppable in all four runs, leading from start to finish, to become Britain\'s first gold medalist in a sliding sport since Anthony Nash and Robin Dixon in the two-man bobsleigh in 1964.  Former rower Steve Redgrave, Britain\'s most decorated Olympian, greeted Williams after her final slide to glory.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy.

They called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the name, whose precise origin is contested, nevertheless indicates the chief source of their inspiration. Disenchanted with contemporary academic painting—most of them were colleagues at the Royal Academy of Art and famously disparaged the Academy’s founding president, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), as “Sir Sloshua”—the Brotherhood instead emulated the art of late medieval and early Renaissance Europe until the time of Raphael, an art characterized by minute description of detail, a luminous palette of bright colors that recalls the tempera paint used by medieval artists, and subject matter of a noble, religious, or moralizing nature. In mid-nineteenth-century England, a period marked by political upheaval, mass industrialization, and social ills, the Brotherhood at its inception strove to transmit a message of artistic renewal and moral reform by imbuing their art with seriousness, sincerity, and truth to nature.  At London’s Royal Academy and Free Exhibition shows of 1849, several paintings were exhibited with the cryptic initials “P.R.B.” along with the artists’ signatures; among these were Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother, Slain in a Skirmish between the Colonna and Orsini Factions (private collection) by William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Isabella (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) by John Everett Millais (1829–1896), and the Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate, London) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). These canvases, though diverse in subject, embodied the Brotherhood’s initial aims in their keen observation of the natural world and depiction of subjects that lead the viewer to contemplate moral issues of justice, piety, familial relationships, and the struggle of purity against corruption.  Hunt’s work illustrates a passage from a popular Victorian novel, set in fourteenth-century Rome, by Bulwer Lytton, and is characterized by a careful description of the outdoor setting. Millais’ Isabella is based on John Keats’ retelling of a story from Boccaccio’s Decameron; the artist re-creates in sumptuous detail the tastes and textures of a medieval banquet, from the creased tablecloth strewn with nutshells to guests at the grandly arrayed gathering. In his portrayal of the life of the Virgin, Rossetti employs an archaizing style and symbolic elements associated with early Renaissance painting: the lily , representing purity, the dove of the Holy Spirit, and the cruciform trellis. Other founding members of the Brotherhood—James Collinson (1825–1881; he resigned after converting to Catholicism in 1850), William Michael Rossetti (1829–1919), Frederic George Stephens (1827–1907), and the sculptor Thomas Woolner (1825–1892)—exhibited less frequently than its three prolific leading members.  The works of the Pre-Raphaelites met with critical opposition to their pietism, archaizing compositions, intensely sharp focus—which, with an absence of shadows, flattened the depicted forms—and the stark coloration they achieved by painting on a wet white ground. They had, however, several important champions.

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology. Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result.

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ("Context: The temperature range in which food - borne bacteria can grow is known as the danger zone .

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.  All four of us went for a ride on the Luas from Milltown to Sandyford and back. During the journey we chatted about the trams as opposed to the buses.

He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797.  In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  It is often  first Gothic  novel  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.  Notes by Lesley Young  WALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The) - naxos.comWALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The)  The Castle of Otranto  \xa0  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister. He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797. In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, | Question: 'The Castle of Otranto' often called the first gothic novel, was written in 1764 by whom?", ['horace walpole'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4725'), ('Context: Who\'s Buried Where in Britain?

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

10/01/2021 00:45:37 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: BagelA bagel ( \'; ), also spelled beigel,  is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ("Context: The temperature range in which food - borne bacteria can grow is known as the danger zone .

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.  All four of us went for a ride on the Luas from Milltown to Sandyford and back. During the journey we chatted about the trams as opposed to the buses.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.

On a red field, a white equilateral cross whose arms are one sixth longer than their width.  The relationship between the span of the cross and the width of the flag has not been established, but in practice the ratio is about 2:3 or 7:10.  The relative dimensions of the cross are defined in Article 1 of Federal Order #111 on the arms of the Helvetic Confederation (12 December 1889).  Unlike most flags of the world, the Swiss flag is square. This was an issue when Switzerland joined the UN in 2002, as all the flags displayed on UN Plaza should have the same size. The UN first had a rectangular flag, but the Swiss mission protested. Eventually the UN accepted a Swiss square flag. But, in order to have a flag that is not too small, the flag displayed on UN Plaza has the same area of a rectangular flag.

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

The novel proved to critics that “Du Maurier is in a class by herself” (New York Times); her “masterful treatment” of her tale“made Rebecca a classic book” (Steinbrunner & Penzler, 136). “‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.’ The opening line of perhaps the greatest romantic suspense novel ever written has become as familiar to readers as ‘Call me Ishmael’ from Moby-Dick” (Penzler, Crown, 26).

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa.

As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields.

Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.

However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.

(eêroeis)  Erinyes, Apulian red-figure krater C4th B.C., Badische Landesmuseum  THE ERINYES (Furies) were three goddesses of vengeance and retribution who punished men for crimes against the natural order. They were particularly concerned with homicide, unfilial conduct, offenses against the gods, and perjury. A victim seeking justice could call down the curse of the Erinys upon the criminal. The most powerful of these was the curse of the parent upon the child--for the Erinyes were born of just such a crime, being sprung from the blood of Ouranos (Uranus) , when he was castrated by his son Kronos (Cronus) .  The wrath of the Erinyes manifested itself in a number of ways. The most severe of these was the tormenting madness inflicted upon a patricide or matricide. Murderers might suffer illness or disease; and a nation harbouring such a criminal, could suffer dearth, and with it hunger and disease. The wrath of the Erinyes could only be placated with the rite ritual purification and the completion of some task assigned for atonement.  The goddesses were also servants of Haides and Persephone in the underworld where they oversaw the torture of criminals consigned  to the Dungeons of the Damned.  The Erinyes were similar to if not the same as the Poinai (Poenae) (Retaliations), Arai (Arae) (Curses), Praxidikai (Praxidicae) (Exacters of Justice) and Maniai (Maniae) (Madnesses).  They were depicted as ugly, winged women with hair, arms and waists entwined with poisonous serpents. The sisters wielded whips and were clothed either in the long black robes of mourners, or the short-length skirts and boots of huntress- maidens.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation.

They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have, according to the Sunday Mercury, sold more than 100 million records.  When MTV dawned in the early 1980s, it changed the face of popular music forever, and the British rock group Duran Duran was the first act to take full advantage of its possibilities. The five-member band of young, sculpted faces often adorned with make-up and expensive clothes, saw in the music video the perfect vehicle for propelling them beyond obscurity and their musical abilities to fame, fortune, and good times. Combining the sounds of 1970s British punk and the more upbeat, danceable rhythms of disco, Duran Duran began producing clean, sparkling (if not critically acclaimed), pop tunes. But what set them apart immediately were their videos: somewhat surreal escapist fantasies that took the self-styled playboys to such far-flung locales as Sri Lanka and Antigua. Screaming, record-buying, television-watching teen-age girls everywhere ate it up-and nobody could have predicted it better than the band members themselves. "Video to us is like stereo was to Pink Floyd," said Duran Duran keyboa rdist Nick Rhodes. "It was new, it was just happening. And we saw we could do a lot with it." But, with more than 25 years together and more than 70 million albums sold, the group has proven its significance well beyond the video screen.  While the conservative rock press liked to downplay the success of Duran Duran because of their obvious vanity and lack of attention to "serious" music, it should be noted that some of rock and roll\'s most time-honored heroes, such as Elvis Presley and even a few members of the Beatles, were never accused of being serious musicians. Success in pop music has always depended upon image at least as much as the music itself. And "serious music" is not necessarily for everyone as Rolling Stone\'s James Henke realized when he referred to Duran Duran\'s eager fans as "young girls who were glued to their television sets watching MTV every waking hour. These girls had little use for the Clash\'s left-wing politics, or the ranting and raving of that weird-looking Elvis Costello. But Duran Duran, now they were something else. Five extremely good-looking young men. Dream dates."  Duran Duran began coming together in 1978 (some sources say 1977) in the Midlands city of Birmingham, where Rhodes and guitarist John Taylor started performing with a variety of bandmates. The group, which takes its name from a character in the 1968 film Barbarella, became complete in 1980 when Simon Le Bon, a drop-out drama student, showed up one day in pink, leopard-skin leotards and said he wanted to sing in the band. Le Bon joined Rhodes, John Taylor (who switched to b ass), drummer Roger Taylor, and guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related), and the quintet began performing in Birmingham, most frequently at a club called Rum Runners which had become established as the home of England\'s burgeoning New Roma ntic scene. "Donning the foppish clothes of the movement and playing a slick, if superficial, brand of dance-pop, the band was tailor-made for the style obsessed New Romantics," said the Encyclopedia of Rock.  Duran Duran quickly became the headliners of that movement, playing at large clubs and festivals throughout England, and in early 1981 they released their first single, "Planet Earth," which went to number 12 on the United Kingdom charts. Later that year their first album, Duran Duran, went to number three on the album charts and | Question: From which 1968 film did English band Duran Duran take their name?', ['barbarella'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-743'), ('Context: CouscousCouscous (Arabic: الكسكس Kuskus - Berber: ⵙⵉⴽⵙⵓ Seksu) is a North African dish of small steamed balls of semolina, usually served with a stew spooned on top. Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints.

On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

An exceptional copy in scarce original dust jacket, with original Book Society belly band.

The novel proved to critics that “Du Maurier is in a class by herself” (New York Times); her “masterful treatment” of her tale“made Rebecca a classic book” (Steinbrunner & Penzler, 136). “‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.’ The opening line of perhaps the greatest romantic suspense novel ever written has become as familiar to readers as ‘Call me Ishmael’ from Moby-Dick” (Penzler, Crown, 26).

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era.

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.

However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

(eêroeis)  Erinyes, Apulian red-figure krater C4th B.C., Badische Landesmuseum  THE ERINYES (Furies) were three goddesses of vengeance and retribution who punished men for crimes against the natural order. They were particularly concerned with homicide, unfilial conduct, offenses against the gods, and perjury. A victim seeking justice could call down the curse of the Erinys upon the criminal. The most powerful of these was the curse of the parent upon the child--for the Erinyes were born of just such a crime, being sprung from the blood of Ouranos (Uranus) , when he was castrated by his son Kronos (Cronus) .  The wrath of the Erinyes manifested itself in a number of ways. The most severe of these was the tormenting madness inflicted upon a patricide or matricide. Murderers might suffer illness or disease; and a nation harbouring such a criminal, could suffer dearth, and with it hunger and disease. The wrath of the Erinyes could only be placated with the rite ritual purification and the completion of some task assigned for atonement.  The goddesses were also servants of Haides and Persephone in the underworld where they oversaw the torture of criminals consigned  to the Dungeons of the Damned.  The Erinyes were similar to if not the same as the Poinai (Poenae) (Retaliations), Arai (Arae) (Curses), Praxidikai (Praxidicae) (Exacters of Justice) and Maniai (Maniae) (Madnesses).  They were depicted as ugly, winged women with hair, arms and waists entwined with poisonous serpents. The sisters wielded whips and were clothed either in the long black robes of mourners, or the short-length skirts and boots of huntress- maidens.

They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have, according to the Sunday Mercury, sold more than 100 million records.  When MTV dawned in the early 1980s, it changed the face of popular music forever, and the British rock group Duran Duran was the first act to take full advantage of its possibilities. The five-member band of young, sculpted faces often adorned with make-up and expensive clothes, saw in the music video the perfect vehicle for propelling them beyond obscurity and their musical abilities to fame, fortune, and good times. Combining the sounds of 1970s British punk and the more upbeat, danceable rhythms of disco, Duran Duran began producing clean, sparkling (if not critically acclaimed), pop tunes. But what set them apart immediately were their videos: somewhat surreal escapist fantasies that took the self-styled playboys to such far-flung locales as Sri Lanka and Antigua. Screaming, record-buying, television-watching teen-age girls everywhere ate it up-and nobody could have predicted it better than the band members themselves. "Video to us is like stereo was to Pink Floyd," said Duran Duran keyboa rdist Nick Rhodes. "It was new, it was just happening. And we saw we could do a lot with it." But, with more than 25 years together and more than 70 million albums sold, the group has proven its significance well beyond the video screen.  While the conservative rock press liked to downplay the success of Duran Duran because of their obvious vanity and lack of attention to "serious" music, it should be noted that some of rock and roll\'s most time-honored heroes, such as Elvis Presley and even a few members of the Beatles, were never accused of being serious musicians. Success in pop music has always depended upon image at least as much as the music itself. And "serious music" is not necessarily for everyone as Rolling Stone\'s James Henke realized when he referred to Duran Duran\'s eager fans as "young girls who were glued to their television sets watching MTV every waking hour. These girls had little use for the Clash\'s left-wing politics, or the ranting and raving of that weird-looking Elvis Costello. But Duran Duran, now they were something else. Five extremely good-looking young men. Dream dates."  Duran Duran began coming together in 1978 (some sources say 1977) in the Midlands city of Birmingham, where Rhodes and guitarist John Taylor started performing with a variety of bandmates. The group, which takes its name from a character in the 1968 film Barbarella, became complete in 1980 when Simon Le Bon, a drop-out drama student, showed up one day in pink, leopard-skin leotards and said he wanted to sing in the band. Le Bon joined Rhodes, John Taylor (who switched to b ass), drummer Roger Taylor, and guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related), and the quintet began performing in Birmingham, most frequently at a club called Rum Runners which had become established as the home of England\'s burgeoning New Roma ntic scene. "Donning the foppish clothes of the movement and playing a slick, if superficial, brand of dance-pop, the band was tailor-made for the style obsessed New Romantics," said the Encyclopedia of Rock.  Duran Duran quickly became the headliners of that movement, playing at large clubs and festivals throughout England, and in early 1981 they released their first single, "Planet Earth," which went to number 12 on the United Kingdom charts. Later that year their first album, Duran Duran, went to number three on the album charts and | Question: From which 1968 film did English band Duran Duran take their name?', ['barbarella'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-743'), ('Context: CouscousCouscous (Arabic: الكسكس Kuskus - Berber: ⵙⵉⴽⵙⵓ Seksu) is a North African dish of small steamed balls of semolina, usually served with a stew spooned on top. Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.  Since the majority of consumers said that their favourite sweets were either strawberry or blackcurrant flavoured, Fox\'s has also created a new product | Question: What animal is traditionally seen in the branding of Fox\'s Glacier Mints?', ['polar bear'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2327'), ('Context: The United States Solicitor General is the fourth - highest - ranking official in the U.S. Department of Justice .

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

But for one magical Valentine\'s evening, ice dancing was the only thing that anyone in Britain cared about. Robin Scott-Elliot remembers Torvill and Dean\'s perfect dance in Sarajevo  Tuesday 14 July 2009 23:01 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  The girl was the same height as the wall that enclosed the arena. She held a bouquet in one hand and with the other picked furiously at something stuck on the ice, desperate to ensure the surface was perfect for the two competitors waiting their turn. Out of sight, they watched and a country watched with them, millions upon millions waiting, united in a universal anxiety. Perfection was not to be long delayed.  Satisfied with her precise labours, the girl made for the small gate that led off the ice. Jayne Torvill smiled down at her as she scrambled off, her skates now a clumsy hindrance. Alongside Torvill, Christopher Dean stared ahead, inscrutable, his face a mask of calm, his long slender neck, accentuated by his collarless top, giving him the serene air of a swan on the summer water.  The ice was Dean\'s natural habitat, and, at last, the girl banished contentedly into the depths of the Zetra stadium, he led his partner on to the rink.  The gate was closed behind them and they skated briskly to the centre, the brilliance of the ice and the whitewashed wall blurring the spectators and highlighting Torvill and Dean, each clad in billowing tops of darkening purple, he in black trousers and black skates, she in a short dress, also purple, and white skates. It was the evening of Valentine\'s Day, 1984, and in Sarajevo, the host city of the XIV Winter Olympics, two Britons were on the brink of passing forever into sporting greatness.  "My whole family went round to my granny\'s – we always went there for special events like royal weddings. I remember being very nervous – there was so much expectation. And it was just perfect."  Fran, aged 14 in 1984  Whatever the standing of ice dancing as an Olympic sport – a debate for another time, and it would be far from alone in the dock – the simple truth is that on that night in the former Yugoslavia, Torvill and Dean executed an achievement of immense worth. Sport may become, as the Olympic movement demands, relentlessly faster, higher, stronger, but grace spans ages, through a Bradman drive to a Cruyff turn and on to a Federer forehand. Torvill and Dean, artists on ice, reached the rare ground of sporting perfection. What is more, under an almost intolerable weight of expectation, they captured a nation.  Twenty-four million people watched the BBC (the corporation was so fearful of the host broadcaster cutting away during the routine that they covered it with just their own single hand-held camera), a figure that astonishes almost as much as the string of sixes that was to be strung across the screen once the pair\'s finale had left them laid out on the ice. It was double the number who watched the 2008 Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea and nearly 5 million more than viewed England\'s 1990 World Cup semi-final against Germany.

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

But for one magical Valentine\'s evening, ice dancing was the only thing that anyone in Britain cared about. Robin Scott-Elliot remembers Torvill and Dean\'s perfect dance in Sarajevo  Tuesday 14 July 2009 23:01 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  The girl was the same height as the wall that enclosed the arena. She held a bouquet in one hand and with the other picked furiously at something stuck on the ice, desperate to ensure the surface was perfect for the two competitors waiting their turn. Out of sight, they watched and a country watched with them, millions upon millions waiting, united in a universal anxiety. Perfection was not to be long delayed.  Satisfied with her precise labours, the girl made for the small gate that led off the ice. Jayne Torvill smiled down at her as she scrambled off, her skates now a clumsy hindrance. Alongside Torvill, Christopher Dean stared ahead, inscrutable, his face a mask of calm, his long slender neck, accentuated by his collarless top, giving him the serene air of a swan on the summer water.  The ice was Dean\'s natural habitat, and, at last, the girl banished contentedly into the depths of the Zetra stadium, he led his partner on to the rink.  The gate was closed behind them and they skated briskly to the centre, the brilliance of the ice and the whitewashed wall blurring the spectators and highlighting Torvill and Dean, each clad in billowing tops of darkening purple, he in black trousers and black skates, she in a short dress, also purple, and white skates. It was the evening of Valentine\'s Day, 1984, and in Sarajevo, the host city of the XIV Winter Olympics, two Britons were on the brink of passing forever into sporting greatness.  "My whole family went round to my granny\'s – we always went there for special events like royal weddings. I remember being very nervous – there was so much expectation. And it was just perfect."  Fran, aged 14 in 1984  Whatever the standing of ice dancing as an Olympic sport – a debate for another time, and it would be far from alone in the dock – the simple truth is that on that night in the former Yugoslavia, Torvill and Dean executed an achievement of immense worth. Sport may become, as the Olympic movement demands, relentlessly faster, higher, stronger, but grace spans ages, through a Bradman drive to a Cruyff turn and on to a Federer forehand. Torvill and Dean, artists on ice, reached the rare ground of sporting perfection. What is more, under an almost intolerable weight of expectation, they captured a nation.  Twenty-four million people watched the BBC (the corporation was so fearful of the host broadcaster cutting away during the routine that they covered it with just their own single hand-held camera), a figure that astonishes almost as much as the string of sixes that was to be strung across the screen once the pair\'s finale had left them laid out on the ice. It was double the number who watched the 2008 Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea and nearly 5 million more than viewed England\'s 1990 World Cup semi-final against Germany.

We ...\xa0  David Bowie’s weirdest album could also be his first No. 1. Bowie would have loved that.  David Bowie in the video for “Blackstar.”  In the spring of 1983, as David Bowie’s 15th studio album Let’s Dance began its charmed climb up the charts, the album’s producer, Chic bandleader Nile Rodgers, was receiving regular phone calls from his friend and client. “David might not want me to say this,” Rodgers told Rolling Stone in 1989 , for the magazine’s feature on the greatest albums of the ’80s, “but for the first few weeks, even he was surprised. He’s a big artist and a rock-and-roll demigod, but there was still a garage-band guy in there who couldn’t believe his record was selling. I’d be lying in bed, and the phone would ring: ‘Hello, Nile? This is David. Look what’s happening—did you see Billboard this week? Wow, unbelievable!’”  There are two things I have always loved about this possibly apocryphal Bowie story, which now seems especially poignant as we say farewell to the Thin White Duke a.k.a. Ziggy Stardust a.k.a. Aladdin Sane a.k.a. the Man Who Fell to Earth a.k.a. the man in Bret McKenzie’s dream . One, that Bowie, after already setting the agenda for much of the 1970s—helping to invent glam and new wave and arguably punk, and selling plenty of records and concert tickets—still underestimated his own popular reach. And two, that Bowie read Billboard avidly and not-so-secretly coveted hit records.  Advertisement  In that spirit, if you are an American mourning David Bowie today, may I make a suggestion? By Thursday, go buy a copy of Blackstar (stylized as★), his 25th—and final—studio album. It may seem morbid and a little crass, particularly for an artist of Bowie’s legend, which stands quite apart from any sales yardstick. But besides the fact that Blackstar is a great album that scored almost universal raves even before we knew it would be Bowie’s last , we also stand a chance to give Bowie his first-ever chart-topping U.S. album—posthumously, and with a disc widely agreed to be his freest, least compromising, and strangest. That sounds like just the kind of irony that would have delighted David Bowie.  Understanding why David Bowie had no No. 1 albums while he was alive means appreciating how truly bizarre and left-field his bursts of popularity were, even at his peak. Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  Bowie’s chart history, at least in America, is like him: episodic and strange.  While Nile Rodgers is correct to remember Let’s Dance as Bowie’s global best-seller (more than seven million sold worldwide, including platinum sales in the U.S.), it wasn’t Bowie’s first deliberate grasp at the brass ring—or at the sound of black America. Bowie’s hit periods were in fact rather bunchy, tightly centered around the moments Bowie decided to try popularity on, like one of his personae. Unlike with, say, Lou Reed, whose chart history does a poor job of reflecting the man’s true impact , Bowie’s chart history, with all its gaps, actually reflects him rather well. If the legend of Bowie is that of the so-called chameleon—the identity-surfer who wrote the blueprint for such future album-to-album reinventors as Prince , Madonna , and Lady Gaga —this approach allowed him to traffic in hit-record–making without much damaging his reputation.  Prior to ’75, Bowie didn’t often place high on the U.S. charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, he’d only scraped the Top 40 once, with the No. 15 hit “ Space Oddity ”—and that song had to be released twice , in 1969 and 1972, to finally catch on with U.S. radio programmers and | Question: Which pop legend recently topped the album charts with The Next Day ?

Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, China, Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The kanji that make up Japan\'s name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun".  Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan\'s land area. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions. The population of 126\xa0million is the world\'s tenth largest. Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan\'s total population. Approximately 9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo,  the capital city of Japan, which is the sixth largest city proper in the OECD and the fourth leading global city in the world.  The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world\'s largest metropolitan area with over 35 million residents and the world\'s largest urban agglomeration economy.  Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan\'s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.  Japan is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power.    The country has the world\'s third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world\'s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world\'s fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world\'s eighth largest military budget,  used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population enjoys the highest life expectancy, the third lowest infant mortality in the world,    and ranked first in the number of Nobel laureates of any country in Asia.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013.

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel\'s periodical, the Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation. The deluxe illustrated edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871, included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou.  The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne\'s greatest works, along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth. The description of Nemo\'s ship, called the Nautilus, was considered ahead of its time, as it accurately describes features on submarines, which at the time were very primitive vessels. Thus, the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories, unlike some of Verne\'s other works, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels.  Title  The title refers to the distance traveled while under the sea and not to a depth, as 20,000 leagues is over six times the diameter, and nearly three times the circumference of the Earth.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the "reserve army of labour"). This process exerts a downward pressure on wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class. | Question: What impact does workers working harder have on productivity of a business?', ['less workers are required', 'raises the productivity of each worker,'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-7182'), ('Context: Portrait of the Artist as a Young DogPortrait of the Artist as a Young Dog is a collection of short prose stories written by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, first published by Dent on 4 April 1940.   The first paperback copy appeared in 1948, published by the British Publishers Guild.  Background  All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer\'s native Swansea in South Wales. Written over a number of years, the often comic stories show glimpses of his life, from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post.  Thomas claimed, in a letter to Vernon Watkins, that he had "kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons". He claimed also, somewhat dubiously, that the title was not a parody of James Joyce\'s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, although the general influence of Joyce\'s Dubliners was freely acknowledged. In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins: "I\'ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas."  Reception  Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well. Ferris, reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said: "the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more". Critic Jacob Korg later commented that "taken as a group, [the stories] seem to trace the child\'s emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering, pathos, and dignity".  The book has been described as showing Thomas\' "waggish humor at its best, his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display".  Apart from Under Milk Wood, the book is "probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts". It has been suggested that few writers "have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious".   Adaptations  The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas\' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014.   Contents  * "The Peaches"  * "A Visit to Grandpa\'s"  * "Patricia, Edith and Arnold"  * "The Fight"  * "Extraordinary Little Cough"  * "Just Like Little Dogs"  * "Where Tawe Flows"  * "Who Do You Wish Was with Us?"  * "Old Garbo"  * "One Warm Saturday"  Under Milk WoodUnder Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("bugger all" backwards).  They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.  Origins and development  When Thomas was staying at New Quay, Cardiganshire, in West Wales, one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for BBC Wales on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

The Second World War was far from over, yet those countries were looking for ways and means to reconstruct their systems of education once peace was restored. Very quickly, the project gained momentum and soon took on a universal note. New governments, including that of the United States, decided to join in.  Upon the proposal of CAME, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945. Scarcely had the war ended when the conference opened. It gathered together the representatives of forty-four countries who decided to create an organization that would embody a genuine culture of peace. In their eyes, the new organization must establish the “intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind” and, in so doing, prevent the outbreak of another world war.  At the end of the conference, thirty-seven countries founded the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Constitution of UNESCO , signed on 16 November 1945, came into force on 4 November 1946 after ratification by twenty countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Lebanon, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. The first session of the General Conference of UNESCO was held in Paris from 19 November to 10 December 1946 with the participation of representatives from 30 governments entitled to vote.  The political divisions of the Second World War\xa0marked the composition of the founding Member States of UNESCO. It was not until 1951 that Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany became Members, and Spain was accepted\xa0in 1953. Other major historical factors, such as the Cold War, the decolonization process and the dissolution of the USSR, also left their trace on UNESCO. The USSR joined UNESCO in 1954 and was replaced by the Russian Federation in 1992 alongside 12 former Soviet republics. Nineteen African states became Members in the 1960s.  As a consequence of its entry into the United Nations, the People's Republic of China has been the only legitimate representative of China at UNESCO since 1971.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, China, Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The kanji that make up Japan\'s name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun".  Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan\'s land area. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions. The population of 126\xa0million is the world\'s tenth largest. Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan\'s total population. Approximately 9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo,  the capital city of Japan, which is the sixth largest city proper in the OECD and the fourth leading global city in the world.  The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world\'s largest metropolitan area with over 35 million residents and the world\'s largest urban agglomeration economy.  Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan\'s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.  Japan is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power.    The country has the world\'s third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world\'s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world\'s fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world\'s eighth largest military budget,  used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population enjoys the highest life expectancy, the third lowest infant mortality in the world,    and ranked first in the number of Nobel laureates of any country in Asia.  Japan is ranked first in the Country Brand Index,[http://www.futurebrand.com/news/futurebrand-launches-the-country-brand-index-2014-15 FutureBrand | News | FutureBrand launches the Country Brand Index 2014–15] ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report 2015–2016   and is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ("Context: To celebrate the show 's 50th anniversary , episodes had been broadcast every day during the week 6 -- 10 December 2010 under the advertisement banner `` Four Funerals and a Wedding '' .

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel\'s periodical, the Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation. The deluxe illustrated edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871, included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou.  The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne\'s greatest works, along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth. The description of Nemo\'s ship, called the Nautilus, was considered ahead of its time, as it accurately describes features on submarines, which at the time were very primitive vessels. Thus, the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories, unlike some of Verne\'s other works, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels.  Title  The title refers to the distance traveled while under the sea and not to a depth, as 20,000 leagues is over six times the diameter, and nearly three times the circumference of the Earth.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the "reserve army of labour"). This process exerts a downward pressure on wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class. | Question: What impact does workers working harder have on productivity of a business?', ['less workers are required', 'raises the productivity of each worker,'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-7182'), ('Context: Portrait of the Artist as a Young DogPortrait of the Artist as a Young Dog is a collection of short prose stories written by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, first published by Dent on 4 April 1940.   The first paperback copy appeared in 1948, published by the British Publishers Guild.  Background  All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer\'s native Swansea in South Wales. Written over a number of years, the often comic stories show glimpses of his life, from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post.  Thomas claimed, in a letter to Vernon Watkins, that he had "kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons". He claimed also, somewhat dubiously, that the title was not a parody of James Joyce\'s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, although the general influence of Joyce\'s Dubliners was freely acknowledged. In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins: "I\'ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas."  Reception  Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well. Ferris, reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said: "the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more". Critic Jacob Korg later commented that "taken as a group, [the stories] seem to trace the child\'s emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering, pathos, and dignity".  The book has been described as showing Thomas\' "waggish humor at its best, his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display".  Apart from Under Milk Wood, the book is "probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts". It has been suggested that few writers "have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious".   Adaptations  The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas\' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014.   Contents  * "The Peaches"  * "A Visit to Grandpa\'s"  * "Patricia, Edith and Arnold"  * "The Fight"  * "Extraordinary Little Cough"  * "Just Like Little Dogs"  * "Where Tawe Flows"  * "Who Do You Wish Was with Us?"  * "Old Garbo"  * "One Warm Saturday"  Under Milk WoodUnder Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("bugger all" backwards).  They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.  Origins and development  When Thomas was staying at New Quay, Cardiganshire, in West Wales, one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for BBC Wales on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Ejiofor noted this , calling Mordo `` a very complex character that , really , I do n't think can be nailed down either way '' .

Ejiofor described Mordo 's relationship with the Ancient One as `` long and intense '' , while noting a `` growing respect '' between the character and Strange , until `` things get complicated '' . Derrickson felt Mordo was a fundamentalist , saying `` When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code , the process of breaking out of that is a violent one .

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.  In June 1992, the High Court of Australia overturned the previous concept of terra nullius which stated that, in legal terms, Australia was empty of inhabitants when it was first settled by Europeans | Question: What is Australia's largest island?", ['tasmania'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3945'), ("Context: `` As Good as I Once Was '' is a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Toby Keith that reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart .

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

The Second World War was far from over, yet those countries were looking for ways and means to reconstruct their systems of education once peace was restored. Very quickly, the project gained momentum and soon took on a universal note. New governments, including that of the United States, decided to join in.  Upon the proposal of CAME, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945. Scarcely had the war ended when the conference opened. It gathered together the representatives of forty-four countries who decided to create an organization that would embody a genuine culture of peace. In their eyes, the new organization must establish the “intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind” and, in so doing, prevent the outbreak of another world war.  At the end of the conference, thirty-seven countries founded the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Constitution of UNESCO , signed on 16 November 1945, came into force on 4 November 1946 after ratification by twenty countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Lebanon, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. The first session of the General Conference of UNESCO was held in Paris from 19 November to 10 December 1946 with the participation of representatives from 30 governments entitled to vote.  The political divisions of the Second World War\xa0marked the composition of the founding Member States of UNESCO. It was not until 1951 that Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany became Members, and Spain was accepted\xa0in 1953. Other major historical factors, such as the Cold War, the decolonization process and the dissolution of the USSR, also left their trace on UNESCO.

As a consequence of its entry into the United Nations, the People's Republic of China has been the only legitimate representative of China at UNESCO since 1971.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database. There is no transcript for a trial of a Sweeney Todd, nor for that matter any similar crimes.

I find it incredible that Maurice is no longer alive'\xa0  Olga Craig  12:01AM BST 13 Jul 2008  Robin Gibb, co-creator of the most gloriously shallow pop ever, now wears several deeply serious hats: guardian of British heritage, confidante of world leaders, and 21st century Mozart. He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside. 'I didn't want to, I was nervous about seeing it again,' he says self-consciously, fiddling with | Question: Although mostly associated with Manchester in which other part of the UK were the Gibb Brothers born?", ['isle of man'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5573'), ('Context: The ferric chloride test is used to determine the presence of phenols in a given sample or compound ( for instance natural phenols in a plant extract ) .

The Cartier Racing Awards honour the champions of European horseracing and will be announced before an invited audience of 300 on the evening of Tuesday, November 11, 2014.  European horseracing’s equivalent of the Oscars are delivered through a tried and tested combination of points earned by horses in Pattern races throughout 2014 (40%), combined at the end of season with the opinions of a panel of racing journalists (30%) and votes from readers of Racing Post and The Daily Telegraph plus Channel 4 Racing viewers (30%).  Channel 4 Racing joined The Daily Telegraph and Racing Post as media partners of the Cartier Racing Awards towards the end of the last year.  The Cartier Awards were established in 1991 to reward excellence in horseracing. In addition to the eight equine awards, the Cartier/Daily Telegraph Award of Merit goes to the person or persons who, in the opinion of the special 17-strong Cartier Jury, has/have done the most for European racing and/or breeding either over their lifetime or within the past 12 months.  Brilliant miler Kingman (208) currently heads the standings for Cartier Horse Of Year and Cartier Three-Year-Old Colt, but his shock retirement with a throat infection has brought doubt to the outcome of both categories.  Dual Derby winner Australia (164) would overhaul the John Gosden-trained colt on points if victorious on QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot on October 18, with connections considering either the 10-furlong Group One QIPCO Champion Stakes or the mile Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes Sponsored By QIPCO.  The Grey Gatsby (124), who gained a thrilling victory over Australia in the Group One QIPCO Irish Champion Stakes, is also set to line up in the British equivalent for owner Frank Gillespie and trainer Kevin Ryan, along with Cirrus Des Aigles (124) and Noble Mission (90). Cirrus Des Aigles, Corine Barande-Barbe’s stable star who captured the Ascot highlight when collecting the Cartier Older Horse Award in 2011, is set to make his first start since winning the Group One Investec Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs in the Group Two Qatar Prix Dollar at Longchamp this Saturday (October 4).  QIPCO British Champions Day could also have a major bearing on the Cartier Stayer category, with Group One Gold Cup victor Leading Light (80), Group One Palmerstown House Estate Irish St Leger winner Brown Panther (72) and Estimate (24), successful in the Group Two Socialites Electric Cigarettes Doncaster Cup, under consideration for the Group One QIPCO British Champions Long Distance Cup  This weekend’s Group One Qatar Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe is set to play a crucial role in crowning the Cartier Three-Year-Old Filly, with both dual Group One winner Taghrooda (112) and unbeaten dual Classic heroine Avenir Certain (80) on course for the autumn middle distance feature at Longchamp on Sunday, October 5. Kingston Hill (56) and Ectot (24) could make late bids for Cartier Three-Year-Old Colt, while Treve (36), a stunning winner of the French race 12 months ago, will be aiming to bounce back to her best following a lacklustre campaign so far.  A glittering two-day card in Paris also includes the Group One QNB Prix de l’Abbaye de Longchamp on Sunday, which is set to feature the Edward Lynam-trained Sole Power (72) and Stepper Point (42), from the stable of William Muir, who are among the leading contenders for Cartier Sprinter Award.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

A British Series, Life on Mars, has both. In it, Sam Tyler “is a detective who is involved in a car accident and wakes to find himself transported back to 1973 a world dominated by Ford Cortinas, sheep-skin jackets and very hard coppers.” It begins in the present – 2006 – when Simm is working in Manchester, and, during an investigation, gets hit by a car. When wakes up, he is in 1973, and everything is, as one can imagine, very different.  Tyler, played by John Simm, gets into many disagreements with his superior, Gene Hunt, played by Philip Glenister. The interaction between the two is what makes this series interesting, as well as Tyler’s attempts to use his knowledge of police work to resolve cases in a time distant from his own. At the same time, Tyler tries desperately to get back to the future. At the end of the second season – the series only has two seasons, or 16 one-hour episodes, there is a resolution.  Ashes to Ashes is a sort of sequel. It starts in 2008, and Alex (Alexandra) Drake, a hostage negotiator, is shot, and wakes up in 1981, and runs into Gene Hunt, together with two of the other officers from Life on Mars, Ray Carling and Chris Skelton. She is aware of the Sam Tyler case, and knows who they are. She, like Tyler, has to integrate a police force working with what are, to her, retrograde techniques, and also tries to get back home to her daughter Molly.  These two series – a total of 40 one-hour episodes – have their high and low points, but succeed largely because of the acting. Simm and Glenister are wonderful together, and the Gene Hunt character – an irascible, cynical, old-time copper – is simply excellent. In Ashes to Ashes, Glenister again stands out, though Keeley Hawes as Alex Drake is also quite good. The second series gives more importance to three secondary characters, Carling and Skelton, who played second fiddle to Hunt and Tyler in Life on Mars, and Sharon “Shaz” Granger, a young policewoman.  Oftentimes, TV series end in disappointing ways. This was the case with, say, The Sopranos, or Lost. But the ending to Life on Mars makes sense, and the finale of Ashes to Ashes is nothing short of brilliant. It’s one of the best hours of television I’ve ever seen. If you plan to watch these series, by all means do not read anything on the web about them; the spoilers would certainly ruin the endings, especially that of Ashes to Ashes.  It’s worth noting that there was a very misguided US adaptation of Life on Mars, which had an ending that was, to say the least, ridiculous. I’d stay away from it. I watched a couple of episodes, but the actors didn’t have the same charisma as Simm and Glenister.  You can get both of these series from Amazon US or UK. If you’re in the US, you’ll need a multi-zone DVD player for Ashes to Ashes, which has not been released in a US version (region 1). While there are some lulls in these two series, the overall acting, and the broader story of Ashes to Ashes, make them something worth watching. I’ll go back and watch them again in a few years. They are fun, enjoyable, well written, and well acted.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

("Anthony and Cleopatra" by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1885)  smithsonian.com  March 31, 2007  The struggle with her teenage brother over the throne of Egypt was not going as well as Cleopatra VII had hoped. In 49 B.C., Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII—also her husband and, by the terms of their father\'s will, her co-ruler—had driven his sister from the palace at Alexandria after Cleopatra attempted to make herself the sole sovereign. The queen, then in her early twenties, fled to Syria and returned with a mercenary army, setting up camp just outside the capital.  Related Books  Rehabilitating Cleopatra  Meanwhile, pursuing a military rival who had fled to Egypt, the Roman general Julius Caesar arrived at Alexandria in the summer of 48 B.C., and found himself drawn into the Egyptian family feud. For decades Egypt had been a subservient ally to Rome, and preserving the stability of the Nile Valley, with its great agricultural wealth, was in Rome\'s economic interest. Caesar took up residence at Alexandria\'s royal palace and summoned the warring siblings for a peace conference, which he planned to arbitrate. But Ptolemy XIII\'s forces barred the return of the king\'s sister to Alexandria. Aware that Caesar\'s diplomatic intervention could help her regain the throne, Cleopatra hatched a scheme to sneak herself into the palace for an audience with Caesar. She persuaded her servant Apollodoros to wrap her in a carpet (or, according to some sources, a sack used for storing bedclothes), which he then presented to the 52-year old Roman.  The image of young Cleopatra tumbling out of an unfurled carpet has been dramatized in nearly every film about her, from the silent era to a 1999 TV miniseries, but it was also a key scene in the real Cleopatra\'s staging of her own life. "She was clearly using all her talents from the moment she arrived on the world stage before Caesar," says Egyptologist Joann Fletcher, author of a forthcoming biography, Cleopatra the Great.  Cleopatra and Ceasar by Jean-Léon Gérôme portrays the scene in which Cleopatra emerges from the carpet—probably somewhat disheveled, but dressed in her best finery—and begs Caesar for aid, the gesture that won over Rome\'s future dictator-for-life. With his help Cleopatra regained Egypt\'s throne.

Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow.

Violet Kray, 72, died of cancer last week.  It was the first time the Krays, 49, had been seen in public since being sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in 1969.  Security was tight for the funeral service in east London.  Criminal twins  The brothers arrived separately - both were handcuffed to a prison guard and flanked by police officers.  Ronnie Kray was brought from Broadmoor Hospital for the criminally insane in Berkshire where he has spent the last four years.  His brother travelled from Parkhurst Prison in the Isle of Wight where he is still held as a maximum security Category "A" prisoner.  The service was attended by a number of celebrities and underworld figures known to the twins from the days when they ran one of London\'s biggest criminal operations.  Among them was actress Diana Dors who arrived wearing a black dress and sunglasses and carrying a bouquet.

There is little doubt that Stevenson would have liked solemnly to don the black cap and sentence them to the end he believed they richly deserved  -  dangling, necks broken, from a rope after a 9am walk to the gallows at Wandsworth or Pentonville.

Japanese Cuisine  While almost everyone knows about Japanese Sushi and or Sashimi - which of course is raw fish of all types served with rice, wasabi, and seaweed in the Nigiri style or in rolls, which wrap fish and vegetables inside the seaweed.  Sushi is now so popular that some countries have created there own versions - a roll featuring avocado and imitation crab instead of raw fish. While its most eager fans would have no problem eating it every day, in Japan sushi is hardly an everyday affair.  In fact, Japanese cuisine offers so much more than just the raw fish, teriyaki and tempura too.  Besides sushi the Japanese cuisine offers a great variety of dishes and regional specialties. Some of the most popular Japanese dishes we recommend you should try at least once while in Japan are listed below.  Teppanyaki - "Teppanyaki" is a style of cooking in which the chef prepares various seafoods, cuts of beef, chicken and fresh vegetables in front of the customer and cooks by grilling on a large steel hot plate called a "Teppan".  Okonomiyaki - The word comes from two Japanese words meaning, "What you like" and "cooked." This is Japan\'s take on the pancake - a savory dish of seafood, meat, and vegetables in a thick dough.  Yakitori - It is made from several bite-sized pieces of chicken meat, or chicken skewered on a bamboo skewer and barbecued, usually over charcoal.  Yakiniku – refers to a Japanese style of cooking bit-size meat and vegetables, on a grill over flame of wood charcoals.  Shabu-Shabu - a Japanese variation of hot pot. The dish is related to sukiyaki in style, where both use thinly sliced meat and vegetables, and usually served with dipping sauces.  Chanko-Nabe - is a Japanese stew commonly eaten in vast quantity by sumo wrestlers as part of a weight gain diet. It contains a dashi or chicken broth soup base with sake to add flavor.  Of course there are many Japanese chain and local restaurants throughout Japan where you can sample these unique Japanese cuisine. On the other hand there are also exclusive Japanese restaurants that most only hear about. These unique restaurants offer the very best in Japanese cuisine; service and location and are only available by reservation.  grouptable.com | BangaloreBE SOCIAL!LIKE US & GET UPDATES ON LATEST DEALS  Japanese Cuisine  Most people associate Sushi and Sashimi to Japanese food. However, there is more to Japanese cuisine than just raw fish and seaweed rolls. Japanese dishes focus on the use of seasonal ingredients, quality produce and of course, immaculate presentation. Rice and Udon noodles are part of the staple diet. Besides this, common ingredients in Japanese dishes include seaweed, tofu and seafood.  The cuisine differs from one region to another and has influences from both China and the West. The most popular dishes in Japanese restaurants usually belong to either the Kanto or the Kansai styles. The Kanto region, which lies on the eastern coast of the main island, has food with strong flavours, characterised by the heavy use of dark soy. On the other hand, Kansai Japanese food relies on delicate flavours and only uses mild seasoning.  Here is a list of some of the popular dishes that can be found on the Japanese buffet or meals in most restaurants.  Teriyaki:  This dish uses a technique of marinating the meat in Teriyaki sauce (which combines soy sauce, mirin and sugar) before grilling or broiling it. Versions of this dish, which use chicken, beef or vegetables, can be found on most Japanese restaurant menus.  Tempura:  It is a dish involving precision as the right temperature of the oil and the perfect consistency of the batter are required for a light and crispy tempura. Often Squid, prawn, baby corn or mushroom tempura can be found on the menu of the best Japanese restaurants. The dish is usually served with a dipping sauce flavoured with daikon radish.

I find it incredible that Maurice is no longer alive'\xa0  Olga Craig  12:01AM BST 13 Jul 2008  Robin Gibb, co-creator of the most gloriously shallow pop ever, now wears several deeply serious hats: guardian of British heritage, confidante of world leaders, and 21st century Mozart. He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside.

The Cartier Racing Awards honour the champions of European horseracing and will be announced before an invited audience of 300 on the evening of Tuesday, November 11, 2014.  European horseracing’s equivalent of the Oscars are delivered through a tried and tested combination of points earned by horses in Pattern races throughout 2014 (40%), combined at the end of season with the opinions of a panel of racing journalists (30%) and votes from readers of Racing Post and The Daily Telegraph plus Channel 4 Racing viewers (30%).  Channel 4 Racing joined The Daily Telegraph and Racing Post as media partners of the Cartier Racing Awards towards the end of the last year.  The Cartier Awards were established in 1991 to reward excellence in horseracing. In addition to the eight equine awards, the Cartier/Daily Telegraph Award of Merit goes to the person or persons who, in the opinion of the special 17-strong Cartier Jury, has/have done the most for European racing and/or breeding either over their lifetime or within the past 12 months.  Brilliant miler Kingman (208) currently heads the standings for Cartier Horse Of Year and Cartier Three-Year-Old Colt, but his shock retirement with a throat infection has brought doubt to the outcome of both categories.  Dual Derby winner Australia (164) would overhaul the John Gosden-trained colt on points if victorious on QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot on October 18, with connections considering either the 10-furlong Group One QIPCO Champion Stakes or the mile Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes Sponsored By QIPCO.  The Grey Gatsby (124), who gained a thrilling victory over Australia in the Group One QIPCO Irish Champion Stakes, is also set to line up in the British equivalent for owner Frank Gillespie and trainer Kevin Ryan, along with Cirrus Des Aigles (124) and Noble Mission (90). Cirrus Des Aigles, Corine Barande-Barbe’s stable star who captured the Ascot highlight when collecting the Cartier Older Horse Award in 2011, is set to make his first start since winning the Group One Investec Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs in the Group Two Qatar Prix Dollar at Longchamp this Saturday (October 4).

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

A British Series, Life on Mars, has both. In it, Sam Tyler “is a detective who is involved in a car accident and wakes to find himself transported back to 1973 a world dominated by Ford Cortinas, sheep-skin jackets and very hard coppers.” It begins in the present – 2006 – when Simm is working in Manchester, and, during an investigation, gets hit by a car. When wakes up, he is in 1973, and everything is, as one can imagine, very different.  Tyler, played by John Simm, gets into many disagreements with his superior, Gene Hunt, played by Philip Glenister. The interaction between the two is what makes this series interesting, as well as Tyler’s attempts to use his knowledge of police work to resolve cases in a time distant from his own. At the same time, Tyler tries desperately to get back to the future. At the end of the second season – the series only has two seasons, or 16 one-hour episodes, there is a resolution.  Ashes to Ashes is a sort of sequel. It starts in 2008, and Alex (Alexandra) Drake, a hostage negotiator, is shot, and wakes up in 1981, and runs into Gene Hunt, together with two of the other officers from Life on Mars, Ray Carling and Chris Skelton. She is aware of the Sam Tyler case, and knows who they are. She, like Tyler, has to integrate a police force working with what are, to her, retrograde techniques, and also tries to get back home to her daughter Molly.  These two series – a total of 40 one-hour episodes – have their high and low points, but succeed largely because of the acting. Simm and Glenister are wonderful together, and the Gene Hunt character – an irascible, cynical, old-time copper – is simply excellent. In Ashes to Ashes, Glenister again stands out, though Keeley Hawes as Alex Drake is also quite good. The second series gives more importance to three secondary characters, Carling and Skelton, who played second fiddle to Hunt and Tyler in Life on Mars, and Sharon “Shaz” Granger, a young policewoman.  Oftentimes, TV series end in disappointing ways. This was the case with, say, The Sopranos, or Lost. But the ending to Life on Mars makes sense, and the finale of Ashes to Ashes is nothing short of brilliant. It’s one of the best hours of television I’ve ever seen. If you plan to watch these series, by all means do not read anything on the web about them; the spoilers would certainly ruin the endings, especially that of Ashes to Ashes.  It’s worth noting that there was a very misguided US adaptation of Life on Mars, which had an ending that was, to say the least, ridiculous. I’d stay away from it. I watched a couple of episodes, but the actors didn’t have the same charisma as Simm and Glenister.  You can get both of these series from Amazon US or UK. If you’re in the US, you’ll need a multi-zone DVD player for Ashes to Ashes, which has not been released in a US version (region 1). While there are some lulls in these two series, the overall acting, and the broader story of Ashes to Ashes, make them something worth watching. I’ll go back and watch them again in a few years. They are fun, enjoyable, well written, and well acted.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

("Anthony and Cleopatra" by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1885)  smithsonian.com  March 31, 2007  The struggle with her teenage brother over the throne of Egypt was not going as well as Cleopatra VII had hoped. In 49 B.C., Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII—also her husband and, by the terms of their father\'s will, her co-ruler—had driven his sister from the palace at Alexandria after Cleopatra attempted to make herself the sole sovereign. The queen, then in her early twenties, fled to Syria and returned with a mercenary army, setting up camp just outside the capital.  Related Books  Rehabilitating Cleopatra  Meanwhile, pursuing a military rival who had fled to Egypt, the Roman general Julius Caesar arrived at Alexandria in the summer of 48 B.C., and found himself drawn into the Egyptian family feud. For decades Egypt had been a subservient ally to Rome, and preserving the stability of the Nile Valley, with its great agricultural wealth, was in Rome\'s economic interest. Caesar took up residence at Alexandria\'s royal palace and summoned the warring siblings for a peace conference, which he planned to arbitrate. But Ptolemy XIII\'s forces barred the return of the king\'s sister to Alexandria. Aware that Caesar\'s diplomatic intervention could help her regain the throne, Cleopatra hatched a scheme to sneak herself into the palace for an audience with Caesar. She persuaded her servant Apollodoros to wrap her in a carpet (or, according to some sources, a sack used for storing bedclothes), which he then presented to the 52-year old Roman.  The image of young Cleopatra tumbling out of an unfurled carpet has been dramatized in nearly every film about her, from the silent era to a 1999 TV miniseries, but it was also a key scene in the real Cleopatra\'s staging of her own life. "She was clearly using all her talents from the moment she arrived on the world stage before Caesar," says Egyptologist Joann Fletcher, author of a forthcoming biography, Cleopatra the Great.  Cleopatra and Ceasar by Jean-Léon Gérôme portrays the scene in which Cleopatra emerges from the carpet—probably somewhat disheveled, but dressed in her best finery—and begs Caesar for aid, the gesture that won over Rome\'s future dictator-for-life. With his help Cleopatra regained Egypt\'s throne.

Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.

Japanese Cuisine  While almost everyone knows about Japanese Sushi and or Sashimi - which of course is raw fish of all types served with rice, wasabi, and seaweed in the Nigiri style or in rolls, which wrap fish and vegetables inside the seaweed.

Yakitori - It is made from several bite-sized pieces of chicken meat, or chicken skewered on a bamboo skewer and barbecued, usually over charcoal.  Yakiniku – refers to a Japanese style of cooking bit-size meat and vegetables, on a grill over flame of wood charcoals.  Shabu-Shabu - a Japanese variation of hot pot.

Rice and Udon noodles are part of the staple diet. Besides this, common ingredients in Japanese dishes include seaweed, tofu and seafood.  The cuisine differs from one region to another and has influences from both China and the West. The most popular dishes in Japanese restaurants usually belong to either the Kanto or the Kansai styles.

Here is a list of some of the popular dishes that can be found on the Japanese buffet or meals in most restaurants.  Teriyaki:  This dish uses a technique of marinating the meat in Teriyaki sauce (which combines soy sauce, mirin and sugar) before grilling or broiling it. Versions of this dish, which use chicken, beef or vegetables, can be found on most Japanese restaurant menus.  Tempura:  It is a dish involving precision as the right temperature of the oil and the perfect consistency of the batter are required for a light and crispy tempura.

However , it was revived in the early 20th century by the Maratha ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur , Shahu Maharaj . In 1902 , Shahu reserved 50 per cent civil service posts in Kolhapur state for all communities other than Brahmins , Prabhus and Parsi . He also sponsored religious ceremonies that did not need a brahmin priest to officiate . By the 1920s , the samaj had established strong roots among the rural masses in Western Maharashtra and Vidarbha and took a strong economic overtone in its message . At that time the organization styled itself the representative of the Bahujan samaj . It also defined the brahmins , merchants and moneylenders as the oppressors of the masses . The Samaj also conducted activities in Satara District , Kolhapur State and other places in this area that were designed to harass Brahmins , and to drive them from their positions as priests , government officials , money - lenders , and teachers in the rural areas . Prior to 1920s , the samaj opposed the Indian national movement because it was a movement led by the elites . Later followers of the Samaj during 20th century included educationalist Bhaurao Patil and Maratha leaders such as Keshavrao Jedhe , Nana Patil , Khanderao Bagal and Madhavrao Bagal .

Achilles was a famous Greek warrior whose mother was one of the immortals, but he was not. His mother sought to protect her son by dipping him in the River Styx, which was believed to have magical powers. She held her infant son by his heel. Consequently, the only part of his body that was vulnerable was his heel. As fate would have it, at the battle of Troy, an enemy warrior, Paris, shot an arrow into Achilles heel and killed him. The phrase “Achilles heel” has come into common usage to describe someone’s personal weakness or vulnerability.\xa0  AchillesIn Greek mythology, Achilles (; , Akhilleus,) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer\'s Iliad. His mother was the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons.  Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term Achilles\' heel has come to mean a person\'s point of weakness.  Etymology   Achilles\' name can be analyzed as a combination of  (\') "grief" and  (\') "a people, tribe, nation." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles\' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of  \' ("glory", usually glory in war).  Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy,  following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.  R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name.   The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.  It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".  Birth   Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.   There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in Argonautica (iv.760) Zeus\' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread.

The riper the grapes, the sweeter they are and thus the higher amount of natural sugar in their juice. The more sugar in the juice, the greater the amount of natural alcohol in the wine. It is the natural alcohol level in the wine, prior to fermentation and prior to performing cellar techniques, that determines the wine\'s quality category.  There are four categories of German wine.  These are identified below.  Deutscher Tafelwein (German Table Wine)  Table wines are those wines made from grapes that have reached the first level of ripeness. By law, these wines must meet the following criteria.  They must contain a natural alcohol content of 6% if originated from the Baden wine region and 5% if originated from all other German wine regions.  They must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the five Tafelwein regions.  They must have a total alcohol content (as defined on the label) ranging between 8.5 - 15%.  Deutscher Landwein (German Country Wine)  Landwein is a superier table wine. By law, these wines must meet the following criteria.  They must contain a natural alcohol content of .5% higher than the Tafelwein.  They must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the 19 Landwein regions.  They must be labeled as "Trocken" or "Halbtrocken" on their label.  Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA)  Literally translated, this is a quality wine from one of the 13 German wine regions. They are usually made in one of two ways: (1) grapes at different ripeness levels are used to produce the wine; or (2) grapes from different vineyards are used to produce the wine. Here in the USA, they may be marketed as "Estate Wines."  According to German law, these wines must meet the following criteria.  They must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the 13 wine regions. The region must be identified on the label .  They must have a total alcohol content (as defined on the label) of at least 7%.  Qualitätswein mit Prädikat (QmP) or Prädikatswein  These identify Germany\'s premium quality wines. They are made from fully ripened grapes and must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the 13 wine regions. These wines are completely natural - the winemaker may not add any additional ingredients (such as sugar or yeast) to the grape juice. Additionally, these wines must have a total alcohol content (as defined on the label) of 7% (or 5% for Beerenauslese and Eiswein varieties).  There are 6 attributes (Prädikate) that define the QmP wines. These attributes are based mainly on ripeness levels of the grapes at the time of harvest. They are listed here in ascending order of grape ripeness levels. This information must be identified on the wine\'s label .  Kabinett - Wines made with fully ripened grapes. These grapes are picked several days after those used for QbA wines. These wines are the lightest of the QmP wines. They contain a low level of alcohol and are excellent with or without food.  Spätlese - This means "Late Harvest" and identifies those wines made with riper grapes. These grapes are picked 12-14 days after those used for Kabinett wines. Spätlese wines are more intense in flavor but are not necessarily sweeter. They pair well with rich, flavorful foods or are excellent on their own as well.  Auslese - Wines made from specially selected, very ripe grapes. These wines are intense in aroma and taste and are usually sweet.  Beerenauslese (BA) - Wines made from specially selected, overripe grapes (by law these grapes must be picked by hand, not mechanically). These are rare wines because the grapes can only achieve this ripeness level if weather conditions permit.

A major factor in this rejection of the tradition of Mosaic authorship was the development of the documentary hypothesis , which understood the Pentateuch as a composite work made up of four `` sources , '' or documents , compiled over centuries in a process that was not concluded until long after Moses ' death . The documentary hypothesis aroused understandable opposition from traditional scholars . One of the most significant was David Zvi Hoffmann ( 1843 - 1921 ) , who attempted to defend Mosaic authorship by demonstrating that the sources identified by the documentary hypothesis were , in fact , pre-exilic ; if this were proven , he believed , then the hypothesis itself was dis - proven . The most he would concede to the proponents of the hypothesis was that Moses may have written various scrolls over his career and that these may have been collated and united before his death . Another important Jewish scholar , and one still active , is David Weiss Halivni ( b. 1927 ) : he has developed a theory of Chate'u Yisrael , literally , `` Israel has sinned '' , which states that the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours and neglected the Torah of Moses , with the result that it became `` blemished and maculated ; '' only on the return from Babylon did the people once again accept the Torah , which was then recompiled and edited by Ezra as evidenced in Ezra -- Nehemiah and Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah . He further states that while the text of the Torah was corrupted , oral tradition was preserved intact , which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details . Menachem Mendel Kasher ( 1895 - 1983 ) , taking a different approach , accepted the documentary hypothesis but adapted it to the Mosaic tradition , pointing to certain traditions of the Oral Torah which show Moses quoting Genesis prior to the epiphany at Sinai ; based on a number of Bible verses and rabbinic statements , he therefore suggested that Moses made use of documents authored by the Patriarchs when redacting that book .

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force.

The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city. The nickname became more commonplace in the years that followed.

Nicknames can help establish the identity of a city. They can also spread pride among its citizens.  New Orleans, Louisiana probably has more nicknames than any other American city. One web site lists more than twenty nicknames. The most famous is “The Big Easy.” It describes the gentle, slow and easy-going way of life in New Orleans.  Bourbon Street in New Orleans  So how did the city get this nickname? In the early 1900s there was a dance hall in New Orleans called “The Big Easy.” But the nickname did not become famous until the early 1970s. That was when a Louisiana newspaper writer began calling New Orleans by this name. She compared the easy-going way of life there to the hurried pace of life in New York City.  In 1970, James Conaway wrote a crime novel called “The Big Easy.” The story was set in New Orleans. In 1987, that book was made into a film which made the nickname even more popular.  New Orleans has other nicknames. One of them is “The Crescent City.” During the 19th century, new neighborhoods expanded out from what is now known as the French Quarter. These areas followed the great curve of the Mississippi River, giving New Orleans the shape of a crescent.  Port of New Orleans  Another nickname is “The Birthplace of Jazz,” because that kind of music started in New Orleans.

Cocktails often contain at least one type of flavoring or liquor, as well as sauces, fruit juices, milk, honey, spices, cream, etc.  The cocktail has been around for quite some time.  The word was first printed in 1803, in ï¿½The Farmerï¿½s Cabinet.ï¿½  A few years later, in 1806, it was again recognized in print when its definition was described in Balance and Columbian Repository.  Sazerac, a cognac-based drink known to be one of the earliest cocktails, dates back to the 1850s.  Cocktails became popular in the prohibition era when mixing drinks was used as an acceptable way to hide the strong taste of bootleg spirits.  Speakeasy bartenders would often mix the spirits with both non-alcoholic and alcoholic ingredients to create a tasty drink.  Even after prohibition ended, cocktails still remained a bar staple.  The skills and recipes created in illegal bars soon spread, and the 1930ï¿½s saw the drink becoming a trendy choice among bar patrons.  Prior to the 1970s, most cocktails were created using rum, gin, and whiskey.  Vodka was also used, but not as often.  After that time, vodka became a more popular ingredient and even replaced the other liquors in well-known drinks.  Today, cocktails are more popular than ever and come in a wide array of flavors, ranging from fruity to potent.

Beer evolves itself, which I think is fair. Although you still have to beware of alcohol, because you never know what could happen to your head.

However , it was revived in the early 20th century by the Maratha ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur , Shahu Maharaj . In 1902 , Shahu reserved 50 per cent civil service posts in Kolhapur state for all communities other than Brahmins , Prabhus and Parsi . He also sponsored religious ceremonies that did not need a brahmin priest to officiate . By the 1920s , the samaj had established strong roots among the rural masses in Western Maharashtra and Vidarbha and took a strong economic overtone in its message . At that time the organization styled itself the representative of the Bahujan samaj . It also defined the brahmins , merchants and moneylenders as the oppressors of the masses . The Samaj also conducted activities in Satara District , Kolhapur State and other places in this area that were designed to harass Brahmins , and to drive them from their positions as priests , government officials , money - lenders , and teachers in the rural areas . Prior to 1920s , the samaj opposed the Indian national movement because it was a movement led by the elites . Later followers of the Samaj during 20th century included educationalist Bhaurao Patil and Maratha leaders such as Keshavrao Jedhe , Nana Patil , Khanderao Bagal and Madhavrao Bagal .

It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died .

Achilles was a famous Greek warrior whose mother was one of the immortals, but he was not. His mother sought to protect her son by dipping him in the River Styx, which was believed to have magical powers. She held her infant son by his heel. Consequently, the only part of his body that was vulnerable was his heel. As fate would have it, at the battle of Troy, an enemy warrior, Paris, shot an arrow into Achilles heel and killed him. The phrase “Achilles heel” has come into common usage to describe someone’s personal weakness or vulnerability.\xa0  AchillesIn Greek mythology, Achilles (; , Akhilleus,) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer\'s Iliad. His mother was the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons.  Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term Achilles\' heel has come to mean a person\'s point of weakness.  Etymology   Achilles\' name can be analyzed as a combination of  (\') "grief" and  (\') "a people, tribe, nation." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles\' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of  \' ("glory", usually glory in war).  Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy,  following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.  R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name.   The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.  It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".  Birth   Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.   There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in Argonautica (iv.760) Zeus\' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941.

The riper the grapes, the sweeter they are and thus the higher amount of natural sugar in their juice. The more sugar in the juice, the greater the amount of natural alcohol in the wine. It is the natural alcohol level in the wine, prior to fermentation and prior to performing cellar techniques, that determines the wine\'s quality category.  There are four categories of German wine.  These are identified below.  Deutscher Tafelwein (German Table Wine)  Table wines are those wines made from grapes that have reached the first level of ripeness. By law, these wines must meet the following criteria.  They must contain a natural alcohol content of 6% if originated from the Baden wine region and 5% if originated from all other German wine regions.  They must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the five Tafelwein regions.  They must have a total alcohol content (as defined on the label) ranging between 8.5 - 15%.  Deutscher Landwein (German Country Wine)  Landwein is a superier table wine. By law, these wines must meet the following criteria.  They must contain a natural alcohol content of .5% higher than the Tafelwein.  They must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the 19 Landwein regions.  They must be labeled as "Trocken" or "Halbtrocken" on their label.  Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA)  Literally translated, this is a quality wine from one of the 13 German wine regions. They are usually made in one of two ways: (1) grapes at different ripeness levels are used to produce the wine; or (2) grapes from different vineyards are used to produce the wine. Here in the USA, they may be marketed as "Estate Wines."  According to German law, these wines must meet the following criteria.  They must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the 13 wine regions. The region must be identified on the label .  They must have a total alcohol content (as defined on the label) of at least 7%.  Qualitätswein mit Prädikat (QmP) or Prädikatswein  These identify Germany\'s premium quality wines. They are made from fully ripened grapes and must be produced exclusively from German grapes grown in one of the 13 wine regions. These wines are completely natural - the winemaker may not add any additional ingredients (such as sugar or yeast) to the grape juice. Additionally, these wines must have a total alcohol content (as defined on the label) of 7% (or 5% for Beerenauslese and Eiswein varieties).  There are 6 attributes (Prädikate) that define the QmP wines. These attributes are based mainly on ripeness levels of the grapes at the time of harvest. They are listed here in ascending order of grape ripeness levels. This information must be identified on the wine\'s label .  Kabinett - Wines made with fully ripened grapes.

A major factor in this rejection of the tradition of Mosaic authorship was the development of the documentary hypothesis , which understood the Pentateuch as a composite work made up of four `` sources , '' or documents , compiled over centuries in a process that was not concluded until long after Moses ' death . The documentary hypothesis aroused understandable opposition from traditional scholars . One of the most significant was David Zvi Hoffmann ( 1843 - 1921 ) , who attempted to defend Mosaic authorship by demonstrating that the sources identified by the documentary hypothesis were , in fact , pre-exilic ; if this were proven , he believed , then the hypothesis itself was dis - proven . The most he would concede to the proponents of the hypothesis was that Moses may have written various scrolls over his career and that these may have been collated and united before his death . Another important Jewish scholar , and one still active , is David Weiss Halivni ( b. 1927 ) : he has developed a theory of Chate'u Yisrael , literally , `` Israel has sinned '' , which states that the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours and neglected the Torah of Moses , with the result that it became `` blemished and maculated ; '' only on the return from Babylon did the people once again accept the Torah , which was then recompiled and edited by Ezra as evidenced in Ezra -- Nehemiah and Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah . He further states that while the text of the Torah was corrupted , oral tradition was preserved intact , which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details . Menachem Mendel Kasher ( 1895 - 1983 ) , taking a different approach , accepted the documentary hypothesis but adapted it to the Mosaic tradition , pointing to certain traditions of the Oral Torah which show Moses quoting Genesis prior to the epiphany at Sinai ; based on a number of Bible verses and rabbinic statements , he therefore suggested that Moses made use of documents authored by the Patriarchs when redacting that book . This view is supported by some rabbinical sources and medieval commentaries which recognize that the Torah incorporates written texts and divine messages from before and after the time of Moses . | Question: who wrote the first five books of moses ?", ['many authors over many centuries'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-7700'), ("Context: Sandra Day O'Connor ( born March 26 , 1930 ) is a retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , having served from her appointment in 1981 by Ronald Reagan until 2006 .

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.

The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city. The nickname became more commonplace in the years that followed.

One web site lists more than twenty nicknames. The most famous is “The Big Easy.” It describes the gentle, slow and easy-going way of life in New Orleans.  Bourbon Street in New Orleans  So how did the city get this nickname? In the early 1900s there was a dance hall in New Orleans called “The Big Easy.” But the nickname did not become famous until the early 1970s. That was when a Louisiana newspaper writer began calling New Orleans by this name. She compared the easy-going way of life there to the hurried pace of life in New York City.  In 1970, James Conaway wrote a crime novel called “The Big Easy.” The story was set in New Orleans. In 1987, that book was made into a film which made the nickname even more popular.  New Orleans has other nicknames. One of them is “The Crescent City.” During the 19th century, new neighborhoods expanded out from what is now known as the French Quarter. These areas followed the great curve of the Mississippi River, giving New Orleans the shape of a crescent.

Cocktails often contain at least one type of flavoring or liquor, as well as sauces, fruit juices, milk, honey, spices, cream, etc.  The cocktail has been around for quite some time.  The word was first printed in 1803, in ï¿½The Farmerï¿½s Cabinet.ï¿½  A few years later, in 1806, it was again recognized in print when its definition was described in Balance and Columbian Repository.  Sazerac, a cognac-based drink known to be one of the earliest cocktails, dates back to the 1850s.  Cocktails became popular in the prohibition era when mixing drinks was used as an acceptable way to hide the strong taste of bootleg spirits.  Speakeasy bartenders would often mix the spirits with both non-alcoholic and alcoholic ingredients to create a tasty drink.  Even after prohibition ended, cocktails still remained a bar staple.  The skills and recipes created in illegal bars soon spread, and the 1930ï¿½s saw the drink becoming a trendy choice among bar patrons.  Prior to the 1970s, most cocktails were created using rum, gin, and whiskey.  Vodka was also used, but not as often.  After that time, vodka became a more popular ingredient and even replaced the other liquors in well-known drinks.  Today, cocktails are more popular than ever and come in a wide array of flavors, ranging from fruity to potent.

This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

Mammy Two Shoes (sometimes Mrs. Two Shoes) is a recurring character in MGM \'s Tom and Jerry cartoons. She is a heavy-set middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters.  As a partially seen character , she was famous for never showing her face (except very briefly in Saturday Evening Puss ). Mammy\'s appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. It was later revealed that her character was greatly inspired by Oscar -winning black actress and singer Hattie McDaniel , best known for playing "Mammy" in MGM and David O. Selznick \'s 1939 film Gone with the Wind .  A character very similar to Mammy Two Shoes had earlier been portrayed in the Disney Silly Symphonies shorts Three Orphan Kittens and More Kittens , as well as the Pluto short Pantry Pirate and the Figaro short Figaro and Cleo . A similar character Aunt Petunia the Mammy actually shows her face which resembles blackface in The Little Audrey Cartoon Series .  Contents  7 References  \xa0 Theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoons  \xa0 Mammy Two Shoes, in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , whose full face was shown for the first time.  Mammy first appeared in Puss Gets the Boot , the first Tom and Jerry cartoon (except Tom was called "Jasper"). She always referred to Tom as his given name Thomas and almost always used "is" in conjunction with a pronoun ("is you" and "I is"). The character went on to make many appearances through the entire series until 1952 and her last appearance in the short, Push-Button Kitty . William Hanna and Joseph Barbera initially portrayed Mammy as the maid of the house, with the real owners unknown to us. Later, Hanna and Barbera seemed to suggest, through dialogue and occasional behavior, that the house was Mammy\'s own.  Mammy was originally voiced by well-known African-American character actress Lillian Randolph . In the 1960s, the MGM animation studio , by then under the supervision of Chuck Jones , created censored versions of the Tom & Jerry cartoons featuring Mammy for television. These versions used rotoscoping techniques to replace Mammy on-screen with a similarly stocky white woman (in most shorts) or a thin white woman (in Saturday Evening Puss); Randolph\'s voice on the soundtracks was replaced by an Irish-accented (or, in Puss, generic young adult) voice performed by white actress June Foray . [1]  The original versions of the cartoons were reinstated when Turner Broadcasting acquired ownership of the Tom & Jerry property. But in 1992, the cartoons featuring Mammy were edited again; this time, to replace Lillian Randolph\'s voice with that of Thea Vidale , who re-recorded the dialogue to remove Mammy\'s use of potentially offensive dialect . These re-recorded versions of the cartoons are aired to this day on Turner\'s Cartoon Network -related cable channels, and have at times turned up on DVD as well. However, some European TV showings of these cartoons, especially the UK, retain Randolph\'s original voice. The Region 2 Complete Collectors Edition DVD boxset has Vidale\'s voice on the first DVD and Randolph in a number of the episodes after that (such as A Mouse in the House and Mouse Cleaning ).  \xa0 Replacement characters for Mammy  From 1954\'s Pet Peeve , Mammy disappeared from Tom and Jerry; the owners of the animals\' house became a young, white, middle-class couple named Joan and George , and starting with 1955\'s The Flying Sorceress , the audience was able to see these owners\' heads.

His breakthrough came in 1982 when he co-wrote and co-starred in BBC Television’s The Young Ones, a situation comedy featuring a group of revolting students on the breadline, squeezing spots, baring bottoms and sharing a filthy flat.  Arms flailing and eyes bulging, Mayall’s character, the angst-ridden loud-mouthed student Rick, chimed with the programme’s unpredictable “alternative” quality. The show tore up the established rules of comedy; the resulting 35 minutes of rampaging, violent slapstick struck some as having more in common with Warner Bros cartoons than with traditional sitcoms.  Related Articles  22 Jan 2009  Mayall in The Young Ones with Adrian Edmonson, Nigel Planer and Christopher Ryan (BBC)  Mayall wrote The Young Ones with his then girlfriend Lise Meyer and another emerging alternative comedy star Ben Elton. Although it found a cult audience straight away — mostly students, teenagers and twentysomethings — others were slow to catch on and it was only when the series was repeated that it began to build a sizeable audience.  In contrast to his outrageous, rebarbative characterisations, Mayall was quietly-spoken and shy, with a reputation as the chameleon comedian: “fluent, funny, polite, informed” noted one of the comparatively few interviewers he spoke to, but “also evasive, slippery, canny, cautious and a tad self-congratulatory”.  “There’s a quality about me,” Mayall himself once confessed, “that you don’t quite trust”.  Although he became a defining part of the television landscape of the 1980s — including a memorable turn as the rumbustiously randy Squadron Commander Flashheart in Blackadder Goes Forth (“Always treat your kite like you treat your woman ... get inside her five times a day and take her to heaven and back!”) — Mayall always preferred working in the live theatre. His fellow comic actor Simon Fanshawe ascribed to Mayall “a kind of pure energy as a solo performer on stage that, if you are prepared for the ride, is irresistible”.  In April 1998, when he was 40, a near-fatal accident on a quad bike left Mayall in a coma for five days; severe head injuries caused impaired memory, shaky co-ordination and speech problems. “The accident was over Easter and as you know, Jesus our Lord was nailed to the cross on Good Friday,” recounted Mayall in an interview last year. “The day before that is Crap Thursday, and that’s the day Rik Mayall died. And then he was dead on Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday until Bank Holiday Monday.”  But he appeared to have made a complete recovery, and returned to work in blustering form as Richie Twat (pronounced Thwaite) in Guesthouse Paradiso (1999), a film he co-wrote with his friend and long-time comedy partner Adrian Edmondson.  Although his part as Peeves the poltergeist in the first Harry Potter film failed to make the final cut, Mayall remained philosophical. “I’ve looked over the edge,” he remarked, adding that his brush with death had taught him that ending up on the cutting room floor hardly seemed so bad.  Rik Mayall: 'one of the funniest performers ever' (JIMMY GASTON)  Richard Michael Mayall was born on March 7 1958 at Matching Tye, a village near Harlow, Essex, but brought up in Droitwich, Worcestershire.

The first paperback copy appeared in 1948, published by the British Publishers Guild.  Background  All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer\'s native Swansea in South Wales. Written over a number of years, the often comic stories show glimpses of his life, from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post.  Thomas claimed, in a letter to Vernon Watkins, that he had "kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons". He claimed also, somewhat dubiously, that the title was not a parody of James Joyce\'s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, although the general influence of Joyce\'s Dubliners was freely acknowledged. In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins: "I\'ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas."  Reception  Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well. Ferris, reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said: "the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more". Critic Jacob Korg later commented that "taken as a group, [the stories] seem to trace the child\'s emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering, pathos, and dignity".  The book has been described as showing Thomas\' "waggish humor at its best, his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display".  Apart from Under Milk Wood, the book is "probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts". It has been suggested that few writers "have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious".   Adaptations  The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas\' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014.   Contents  * "The Peaches"  * "A Visit to Grandpa\'s"  * "Patricia, Edith and Arnold"  * "The Fight"  * "Extraordinary Little Cough"  * "Just Like Little Dogs"  * "Where Tawe Flows"  * "Who Do You Wish Was with Us?"  * "Old Garbo"  * "One Warm Saturday"  Under Milk WoodUnder Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("bugger all" backwards).  They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.  Origins and development  When Thomas was staying at New Quay, Cardiganshire, in West Wales, one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for BBC Wales on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

From my research, I believe a young  music enthusiast from the Monterey area, who had attended the Monterey Jazz  Festival thought it would be great to present a Pop music festival similar to the  Jazz festival. As he started his quest, one of the first acts he contacted was the Mama\'s & the Papa\'s.  When Lou Adler and John Phillips found that the young man simply didn\'t have the resources to effectively produce and promote this type of event, they stepped in to help and eventually bought the young man out.  1967  Look Closely, This photo shows the spot where Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Hendrix supposedly scratched this himself the night of his performance. It is from this exact same stage where the Monterey Summer of Love Festival - 45 Years Later will take place!  An aerial view of the packed arena at The Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday June 17th, 1967. Its amazing that this little arena still looks almost exactly like it did 45 years ago.  The \'67 festival started on a Friday evening and ended late on Sunday night. In between, Music History was made.  Sunday, June 18  With two huge singles behind them, the Airplane was one of the  major attractions of the festival.  The Who  Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of "My Generation", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction". The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died 6 months later in a plane crash at the age of 26.  Ravi Shankar  Ravi Shankar was another artist who was introduced to America at the Monterey festival. The Raga Dhun (Dadra and Fast Teental) (which was later miscredited as "Raga Bhimpalasi") an excerpt from Shankar\'s four-hour performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, concluded the Monterey Pop film, introducing the artist to a new generation of music fans.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'

Published on Nov 8, 2014  This video is about Mitochondrial Eve  The idea that a African Woman, “Mitochondrial Eve", is the woman from whom all people on earth inherit their DNA  Is proven to be a scientific  fact.  In the field of human genetics, the name Mitochondrial Eve refers to the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living anatomically modern humans,  She is from Africa, & is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago.  This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend.  The dating for "Eve" was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis and a boost to the theory of the origin and dispersion of modern humans from Africa.  The biblical connotation was very clear from the start.  1 January 1987 in Nature, in which their findings clearly showed that all current human mtDNA originated from a single population from Africa.  mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or matrilineally.  The Human MRCA studies, confirm that All humans alive today share a surprisingly recent common African ancestor, This is true, even for people born on different continents.  Category  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through ...Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  by John Taylor  Background:  In human genetics, Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans. This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend, in an unbroken line, on their mother’s side, and through the mothers of those mothers, and so on, back until all lines converge on one woman, who is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago. Because all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) generally (but see paternal mtDNA transmission) is passed from mother to offspring without recombination, all mtDNA in every living person is directly descended from hers by definition, differing only by the mutations that over generations have occurred in the germ cell mtDNA since the conception of the original “Mitochondrial Eve”.  Mitochondrial Eve is named after mitochondria and the biblical Eve. Unlike her biblical namesake, she was not the only living human female of her time. However, her female contemporaries, excluding her mother, failed to produce a direct unbroken female line to any living person in the present day.  Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived between 99,000 and 200,000 years ago, most likely in East Africa, when Homo sapiens sapiens (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species.  Origin of the name:  Cann, Stoneking and Wilson did not use the term “Mitochondrial Eve” or even the name “Eve” in their original paper; it appears to be a catchy term popularised by the media.

The star of the books Angels and Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2004) and The Lost Symbol (2009), Langdon is a dashing scholar and professor of religious symbology at Harvard University, whose love of antiquities draws him into myterious and deadly adventures. In Angels and Demons he tangles with a secret society known as the Illuminati, and in The Da Vinci Code he investigates a murder in the Louvre and discovers mysterious clues leading to the Catholic Church, Jesus and Mary Magdalene , and Leonardo Da Vinci .  Langdon was played by actor Tom Hanks in the 2006 film of The Da Vinci Code; his colleague, the French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, was played by Audrey Tautou . Hanks reprised the role in the 2009 film of Angels and Demons, this time with actress Ayelet Zurer as his brainy female sidekick.  Extra credit:  In The DaVinci Code, Robert Langdon is described as looking like “ Harrison Ford in Harris tweed”… According to Angels and Demons, Langdon was “a varsity diver in prep school and in college”… In real life there is no professorship of religious symbology at Harvard; Brown invented the position for his tales.

Advertisement  Advertisement  Robert Langdon: the Inferno characterRobert Langdon: the Inferno character  Leave a comment Inferno's Personalities By Florence Inferno  Robert Langdon is a fictional character created by American author Dan Brown for his novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), and the bestseller Inferno (2013). Langdon is a Harvard University professor of Religious Iconology and Symbology.  Character development  Dan Brown created the character as a fictional alter ego of himself, or of “the man he wishes he could be.” Brown was born June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire. Likewise, the fictional Langdon is described as also having been born on June 22 in Exeter, and having attending the same school as Brown did, Phillips Exeter Academy.  Brown named the character after John Langdon, a professor of typography at Drexel University who is known for his creation of ambigrams, typographical designs that can be read in multiple ways; for example, right side up and upside down. An example of Langdon’s ambigrams appeared on the cover of the first edition of Angels & Demons.  Storyline  Little background detail is provided by Brown. In The Da Vinci Code, Langdon wears a turtleneck, a Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers, and does this to all events, ranging from lectures to social events. A frequently referred to accessory is his Mickey Mouse watch, a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. He drives an automatic Saab 900S.  Langdon was a diver at Phillips Exeter Academy in prep school and played water polo at Princeton University, where he went for college. He suffers from claustrophobia, the fear of enclosed spaces, stemming from the time he fell into a well when he was 7 years old. His father died when he was 12, and his new mentor father-figure became Peter Solomon, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  Known for his brilliant problem-solving mind and his genius, Langdon has an eidetic memory and an understanding of semiotics. As a professor at Harvard University, he teaches Religious Iconology and the fictional field of Symbology. The fast-paced thriller Angels & Demons follows Langdon’s attempts to protect the Vatican from the Illuminati, a secret society formed during the Renaissance that was opposed to the Roman Catholic Church.  Brown brought back Langdon in The Da Vinci Code, a thriller that centres on art history, Christianity’s origins, and arcane theories. Attempting to solve the murder of the Louvre’s curator, Langdon encounters mysterious organizations (Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion), discusses the hidden messages in Leonardo da Vinci | Question: Who played 'Robert Langdon' in 'The Da Vinci Code'?", ['tom hanks'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7421'), ('Context: Wrigley FieldWrigley Field is a baseball park on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States, which is the home of the Chicago Cubs, one of the city\'s two Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises.  Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a FlyThe phrase and title There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly—alternatively, I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, or There Was an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly, or I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly—is a children\'s rhyme and song of a kind known as cumulative. The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals, each to catch the previously swallowed animal. There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics, especially for the description of swallowing each animal. The spider and fly are described in each verse, but the other animals are only described when they are introduced.The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman\'s death: the logic of swallowing of even more animals of ridiculous sizes without dying, contrasted with the expected, matter-of-fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself, when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd.  A widely distributed version of the song was released on Brunswick Records in 1953, where it was sung by Burl Ives. A 1961 version in print indicates that the lyrics are by Rose Bonne, where the music in that edition was composed by Alan Mills.  For a further example remaining in print, see    Lyrics  The following is one published, readily available form of the lyrics, that are representative of the nature of this cumulative lyric:  There was an old lady who swallowed a fly  I don\'t know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she\'ll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a bird;  How absurd to swallow a bird.  She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;  I don\'t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she\'ll die!  There was an old lady who swallowed a cat;  Fancy that to swallow a cat!  She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,  She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;  I don\'t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she\'ll die!  There was an old lady that swallowed a dog;  What a hog, to swallow a dog;  She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,  She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,  She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;  I don\'t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she\'ll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a horse...;  ...She\'s dead, of course!   In some versions, "perhaps she\'ll die" is replaced with "don\'t ask me why." Also, "she died of course" is replaced with "of course, of course, she swallowed a horse," leading to yet another cumulative verse that ends the tale.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994). After a break from writing, he returned in 2008 with a thriller entitled Second World.  Views on underage sex  In October 2012, he was charged with child sex offences allegedly committed in the 1990s. In December 2012, he denied six counts of rape involving a girl under 16.  The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.  In August 2013, he said that girls who throw themselves at celebrities or who "go out and just have a good time" could themselves be to blame. In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.  Shah\'s comments came directly after a prosecuting barrister was suspended following "inappropriate comments" concerning the rape of a 13-year-old.   Personal life  Shah is married to actress Jennifer White Shah, whom he first met while he was working for Granada Television. The company was producing The Caesars (1968) and Jennifer White  was an actress playing Caligula\'s sister in the series.

This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

Mammy Two Shoes (sometimes Mrs. Two Shoes) is a recurring character in MGM \'s Tom and Jerry cartoons. She is a heavy-set middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters.  As a partially seen character , she was famous for never showing her face (except very briefly in Saturday Evening Puss ). Mammy\'s appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. It was later revealed that her character was greatly inspired by Oscar -winning black actress and singer Hattie McDaniel , best known for playing "Mammy" in MGM and David O. Selznick \'s 1939 film Gone with the Wind .  A character very similar to Mammy Two Shoes had earlier been portrayed in the Disney Silly Symphonies shorts Three Orphan Kittens and More Kittens , as well as the Pluto short Pantry Pirate and the Figaro short Figaro and Cleo . A similar character Aunt Petunia the Mammy actually shows her face which resembles blackface in The Little Audrey Cartoon Series .  Contents  7 References  \xa0 Theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoons  \xa0 Mammy Two Shoes, in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , whose full face was shown for the first time.  Mammy first appeared in Puss Gets the Boot , the first Tom and Jerry cartoon (except Tom was called "Jasper"). She always referred to Tom as his given name Thomas and almost always used "is" in conjunction with a pronoun ("is you" and "I is"). The character went on to make many appearances through the entire series until 1952 and her last appearance in the short, Push-Button Kitty . William Hanna and Joseph Barbera initially portrayed Mammy as the maid of the house, with the real owners unknown to us. Later, Hanna and Barbera seemed to suggest, through dialogue and occasional behavior, that the house was Mammy\'s own.  Mammy was originally voiced by well-known African-American character actress Lillian Randolph . In the 1960s, the MGM animation studio , by then under the supervision of Chuck Jones , created censored versions of the Tom & Jerry cartoons featuring Mammy for television. These versions used rotoscoping techniques to replace Mammy on-screen with a similarly stocky white woman (in most shorts) or a thin white woman (in Saturday Evening Puss); Randolph\'s voice on the soundtracks was replaced by an Irish-accented (or, in Puss, generic young adult) voice performed by white actress June Foray . [1]  The original versions of the cartoons were reinstated when Turner Broadcasting acquired ownership of the Tom & Jerry property. But in 1992, the cartoons featuring Mammy were edited again; this time, to replace Lillian Randolph\'s voice with that of Thea Vidale , who re-recorded the dialogue to remove Mammy\'s use of potentially offensive dialect . These re-recorded versions of the cartoons are aired to this day on Turner\'s Cartoon Network -related cable channels, and have at times turned up on DVD as well. However, some European TV showings of these cartoons, especially the UK, retain Randolph\'s original voice. The Region 2 Complete Collectors Edition DVD boxset has Vidale\'s voice on the first DVD and Randolph in a number of the episodes after that (such as A Mouse in the House and Mouse Cleaning ).  \xa0 Replacement characters for Mammy  From 1954\'s Pet Peeve , Mammy disappeared from Tom and Jerry; the owners of the animals\' house became a young, white, middle-class couple named Joan and George , and starting with 1955\'s The Flying Sorceress , the audience was able to see these owners\' heads.

His breakthrough came in 1982 when he co-wrote and co-starred in BBC Television’s The Young Ones, a situation comedy featuring a group of revolting students on the breadline, squeezing spots, baring bottoms and sharing a filthy flat.  Arms flailing and eyes bulging, Mayall’s character, the angst-ridden loud-mouthed student Rick, chimed with the programme’s unpredictable “alternative” quality. The show tore up the established rules of comedy; the resulting 35 minutes of rampaging, violent slapstick struck some as having more in common with Warner Bros cartoons than with traditional sitcoms.  Related Articles  22 Jan 2009  Mayall in The Young Ones with Adrian Edmonson, Nigel Planer and Christopher Ryan (BBC)  Mayall wrote The Young Ones with his then girlfriend Lise Meyer and another emerging alternative comedy star Ben Elton. Although it found a cult audience straight away — mostly students, teenagers and twentysomethings — others were slow to catch on and it was only when the series was repeated that it began to build a sizeable audience.  In contrast to his outrageous, rebarbative characterisations, Mayall was quietly-spoken and shy, with a reputation as the chameleon comedian: “fluent, funny, polite, informed” noted one of the comparatively few interviewers he spoke to, but “also evasive, slippery, canny, cautious and a tad self-congratulatory”.  “There’s a quality about me,” Mayall himself once confessed, “that you don’t quite trust”.  Although he became a defining part of the television landscape of the 1980s — including a memorable turn as the rumbustiously randy Squadron Commander Flashheart in Blackadder Goes Forth (“Always treat your kite like you treat your woman ... get inside her five times a day and take her to heaven and back!”) — Mayall always preferred working in the live theatre. His fellow comic actor Simon Fanshawe ascribed to Mayall “a kind of pure energy as a solo performer on stage that, if you are prepared for the ride, is irresistible”.  In April 1998, when he was 40, a near-fatal accident on a quad bike left Mayall in a coma for five days; severe head injuries caused impaired memory, shaky co-ordination and speech problems. “The accident was over Easter and as you know, Jesus our Lord was nailed to the cross on Good Friday,” recounted Mayall in an interview last year. “The day before that is Crap Thursday, and that’s the day Rik Mayall died. And then he was dead on Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday until Bank Holiday Monday.”  But he appeared to have made a complete recovery, and returned to work in blustering form as Richie Twat (pronounced Thwaite) in Guesthouse Paradiso (1999), a film he co-wrote with his friend and long-time comedy partner Adrian Edmondson.  Although his part as Peeves the poltergeist in the first Harry Potter film failed to make the final cut, Mayall remained philosophical. “I’ve looked over the edge,” he remarked, adding that his brush with death had taught him that ending up on the cutting room floor hardly seemed so bad.

The first paperback copy appeared in 1948, published by the British Publishers Guild.  Background  All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer\'s native Swansea in South Wales. Written over a number of years, the often comic stories show glimpses of his life, from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post.  Thomas claimed, in a letter to Vernon Watkins, that he had "kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons". He claimed also, somewhat dubiously, that the title was not a parody of James Joyce\'s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, although the general influence of Joyce\'s Dubliners was freely acknowledged. In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins: "I\'ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas."  Reception  Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well. Ferris, reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said: "the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more". Critic Jacob Korg later commented that "taken as a group, [the stories] seem to trace the child\'s emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering, pathos, and dignity".  The book has been described as showing Thomas\' "waggish humor at its best, his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display".  Apart from Under Milk Wood, the book is "probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts". It has been suggested that few writers "have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious".   Adaptations  The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas\' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014.   Contents  * "The Peaches"  * "A Visit to Grandpa\'s"  * "Patricia, Edith and Arnold"  * "The Fight"  * "Extraordinary Little Cough"  * "Just Like Little Dogs"  * "Where Tawe Flows"  * "Who Do You Wish Was with Us?"  * "Old Garbo"  * "One Warm Saturday"  Under Milk WoodUnder Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("bugger all" backwards).  They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.  Origins and development  When Thomas was staying at New Quay, Cardiganshire, in West Wales, one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for BBC Wales on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction". The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died 6 months later in a plane crash at the age of 26.  Ravi Shankar  Ravi Shankar was another artist who was introduced to America at the Monterey festival. The Raga Dhun (Dadra and Fast Teental) (which was later miscredited as "Raga Bhimpalasi") an excerpt from Shankar\'s four-hour performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, concluded the Monterey Pop film, introducing the artist to a new generation of music fans.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'

Published on Nov 8, 2014  This video is about Mitochondrial Eve  The idea that a African Woman, “Mitochondrial Eve", is the woman from whom all people on earth inherit their DNA  Is proven to be a scientific  fact.  In the field of human genetics, the name Mitochondrial Eve refers to the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living anatomically modern humans,  She is from Africa, & is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago.  This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend.  The dating for "Eve" was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis and a boost to the theory of the origin and dispersion of modern humans from Africa.  The biblical connotation was very clear from the start.  1 January 1987 in Nature, in which their findings clearly showed that all current human mtDNA originated from a single population from Africa.  mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or matrilineally.  The Human MRCA studies, confirm that All humans alive today share a surprisingly recent common African ancestor, This is true, even for people born on different continents.  Category  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through ...Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  by John Taylor  Background:  In human genetics, Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans. This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend, in an unbroken line, on their mother’s side, and through the mothers of those mothers, and so on, back until all lines converge on one woman, who is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago. Because all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) generally (but see paternal mtDNA transmission) is passed from mother to offspring without recombination, all mtDNA in every living person is directly descended from hers by definition, differing only by the mutations that over generations have occurred in the germ cell mtDNA since the conception of the original “Mitochondrial Eve”.  Mitochondrial Eve is named after mitochondria and the biblical Eve. Unlike her biblical namesake, she was not the only living human female of her time. However, her female contemporaries, excluding her mother, failed to produce a direct unbroken female line to any living person in the present day.  Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived between 99,000 and 200,000 years ago, most likely in East Africa, when Homo sapiens sapiens (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species.  Origin of the name:  Cann, Stoneking and Wilson did not use the term “Mitochondrial Eve” or even the name “Eve” in their original paper; it appears to be a catchy term popularised by the media.

The star of the books Angels and Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2004) and The Lost Symbol (2009), Langdon is a dashing scholar and professor of religious symbology at Harvard University, whose love of antiquities draws him into myterious and deadly adventures. In Angels and Demons he tangles with a secret society known as the Illuminati, and in The Da Vinci Code he investigates a murder in the Louvre and discovers mysterious clues leading to the Catholic Church, Jesus and Mary Magdalene , and Leonardo Da Vinci .  Langdon was played by actor Tom Hanks in the 2006 film of The Da Vinci Code; his colleague, the French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, was played by Audrey Tautou . Hanks reprised the role in the 2009 film of Angels and Demons, this time with actress Ayelet Zurer as his brainy female sidekick.  Extra credit:  In The DaVinci Code, Robert Langdon is described as looking like “ Harrison Ford in Harris tweed”… According to Angels and Demons, Langdon was “a varsity diver in prep school and in college”… In real life there is no professorship of religious symbology at Harvard; Brown invented the position for his tales.

Advertisement  Advertisement  Robert Langdon: the Inferno characterRobert Langdon: the Inferno character  Leave a comment Inferno's Personalities By Florence Inferno  Robert Langdon is a fictional character created by American author Dan Brown for his novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), and the bestseller Inferno (2013). Langdon is a Harvard University professor of Religious Iconology and Symbology.  Character development  Dan Brown created the character as a fictional alter ego of himself, or of “the man he wishes he could be.” Brown was born June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire. Likewise, the fictional Langdon is described as also having been born on June 22 in Exeter, and having attending the same school as Brown did, Phillips Exeter Academy.  Brown named the character after John Langdon, a professor of typography at Drexel University who is known for his creation of ambigrams, typographical designs that can be read in multiple ways; for example, right side up and upside down. An example of Langdon’s ambigrams appeared on the cover of the first edition of Angels & Demons.  Storyline  Little background detail is provided by Brown. In The Da Vinci Code, Langdon wears a turtleneck, a Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers, and does this to all events, ranging from lectures to social events. A frequently referred to accessory is his Mickey Mouse watch, a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. He drives an automatic Saab 900S.  Langdon was a diver at Phillips Exeter Academy in prep school and played water polo at Princeton University, where he went for college. He suffers from claustrophobia, the fear of enclosed spaces, stemming from the time he fell into a well when he was 7 years old. His father died when he was 12, and his new mentor father-figure became Peter Solomon, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  Known for his brilliant problem-solving mind and his genius, Langdon has an eidetic memory and an understanding of semiotics. As a professor at Harvard University, he teaches Religious Iconology and the fictional field of Symbology. The fast-paced thriller Angels & Demons follows Langdon’s attempts to protect the Vatican from the Illuminati, a secret society formed during the Renaissance that was opposed to the Roman Catholic Church.  Brown brought back Langdon in The Da Vinci Code, a thriller that centres on art history, Christianity’s origins, and arcane theories. Attempting to solve the murder of the Louvre’s curator, Langdon encounters mysterious organizations (Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion), discusses the hidden messages in Leonardo da Vinci | Question: Who played 'Robert Langdon' in 'The Da Vinci Code'?", ['tom hanks'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7421'), ('Context: Wrigley FieldWrigley Field is a baseball park on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States, which is the home of the Chicago Cubs, one of the city\'s two Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises.  Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a FlyThe phrase and title There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly—alternatively, I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, or There Was an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly, or I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly—is a children\'s rhyme and song of a kind known as cumulative. The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals, each to catch the previously swallowed animal. There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics, especially for the description of swallowing each animal. The spider and fly are described in each verse, but the other animals are only described when they are introduced.The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman\'s death: the logic of swallowing of even more animals of ridiculous sizes without dying, contrasted with the expected, matter-of-fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself, when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd.  A widely distributed version of the song was released on Brunswick Records in 1953, where it was sung by Burl Ives. A 1961 version in print indicates that the lyrics are by Rose Bonne, where the music in that edition was composed by Alan Mills.  For a further example remaining in print, see    Lyrics  The following is one published, readily available form of the lyrics, that are representative of the nature of this cumulative lyric:  There was an old lady who swallowed a fly  I don\'t know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she\'ll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a cat;  Fancy that to swallow a cat!  She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,  She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;  I don\'t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she\'ll die!  There was an old lady that swallowed a dog;  What a hog, to swallow a dog;  She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,  She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,  She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,  She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;  I don\'t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she\'ll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a horse...;  ...She\'s dead, of course!   In some versions, "perhaps she\'ll die" is replaced with "don\'t ask me why." Also, "she died of course" is replaced with "of course, of course, she swallowed a horse," leading to yet another cumulative verse that ends the tale.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established.

He is also the former owner of the Messenger Group.   Early life  Eddy Shah was born in Cambridge. His mother was English and his father was Iranian. Shah was educated at the Scottish co-educational independent boarding school of Gordonstoun, and at both Haywards Heath Grammar School and Haywards Heath Secondary Modern School, at Haywards Heath in Sussex. He then attended a Brighton crammer, where he obtained seven GCE \'O\' Levels.  Shah held various jobs, amongst which was floor manager for Granada\'s television studio. After he was fired from the Manchester Evening News, he decided to launch into newspaper publishing on his own and started with the proceeds of £14,000 from the sale of his first home, in Sale, which he had bought for £4,000. reprinted by TMCnet  Publisher  As the owner of six local newspapers, Shah employed anti-trade union laws introduced by the Thatcher governments to defeat the print unions after national strikes that went on for seven months – despite receiving death threats. He was the first person to invoke Margaret Thatcher\'s anti-union laws to force the unions to the bargaining table. The Wapping dispute followed three years later.  Shah first confronted the trade unions at his Warrington print works and the Manchester news offices in 1983. As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994). After a break from writing, he returned in 2008 with a thriller entitled Second World.  Views on underage sex  In October 2012, he was charged with child sex offences allegedly committed in the 1990s. In December 2012, he denied six counts of rape involving a girl under 16.  The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.  In August 2013, he said that girls who throw themselves at celebrities or who "go out and just have a good time" could themselves be to blame. In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.  Shah\'s comments came directly after a prosecuting barrister was suspended following "inappropriate comments" concerning the rape of a 13-year-old.

The second way to experience Egypt is from the comfort of your own home: online.  Horus, the God of Kings in Ancient Egypt  Horus, the God of Kings  by Jimmy Dunn  From the very earliest of times, the falcon seems to have been worshipped in Egypt as representative of the greatest cosmic powers. Many falcon gods existed throughout Egypt, though over time, a good number of these assimilated to Horus , the most important of the avian deities. Yet, from all his of many forms, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the "true" Horus. Horus is mostly a general term for a great number of falcon deities.  Horus is one of ancient Egypt\'s best known gods , as well as one of its oldest. His name is attested to from at least the beginning of the Dynastic Period , and depictions of falcon deities on earlier artifacts, such as the Narmer Palette, probably represent this same god. The Turin Canon, which provides some of our most important information on Egypt\'s early history, specifically describes the Predynastic rulers of Egypt as "Followers of Horus".  The use of his name was also widespread in personal names throughout Egyptian history, and Hor, as a personal name, survives into our modern era in a number                   of different forms.  Forms of Horus  Horus is a complicated deity, appearing in many different forms and his mythology is one of the most extensive of all Egyptian deities. Indeed, he has so many different aspects that we must limit our discussion to those that are significant. At the same time, a judicious examination of the various Horuses and the sources relating to them supports the possibility that the roles in question are closely interrelated, and so they may be understood as different aspects of the same divine persona.  The original form of Horus was probably that of a sky god, known as "lord of the sky". The Egyptian word " her" (hor, har), from which the god\'s name is derived means "the one on high", or "the distant one", probably in reference to the soaring flight of the hunting falcon, if not a reference to the solar aspect of the god. Mythologically, the god was imagined as a celestial falcon, whose right eye was the sun and left eye the moon. The speckled feathers of his breast were probably considered to be the stars, while his wings were the sky that created the wind. In this form, Horus was apparently worshipped at some of Egypt\'s earliest shrines such as at Nekhen (Heirakonpolis) , where he was assimilated with a number of other local falcon gods. In this capacity, Horus was the patron of the Nekhen monarchy that grew into the historical pharaonic state and hence, the first known national god.  A natural outgrowth of his role as "lord of the sky" was his aspect as a sun god. An ivory comb of the 1st Dynasty king Den depicts a falcon in a boat riding on outstretched wings, suggesting the falcon traversing the sky as the sun god. The early Pyramid Texts specifically refer to him in solar terms as "god of the east", and he  appears in at least three forms in this guise.  As Horakhty (Harakhty), or "Horus of the two horizons", Horus was the god of the rising and setting sun, but more particularly the god of the east and the sunrise. In the Pyramid Texts , the deceased king is said to be reborn in the eastern sky as Horakhty. Eventually, Horakhty became a part of the Heliopolis sun cult and was fused with its solar god as Re-Horakhty .

It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the "Third Coast" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the "south coast", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the "north coast." One of the gulf\'s seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics.  The Gulf\'s basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nmi wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments. It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba, and with the Caribbean Sea (with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea) via the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba. With the narrow connection to the Atlantic, the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges. The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 (615,000\xa0sq\xa0mi). Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters. The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters (550 quadrillion Imperial gallons, 660 quadrillion US gallons, 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi).   Extent  The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southeast limit of the Gulf of Mexico as follows:   A line leaving Cape Catoche Light () with the Light on Cape San Antonio in Cuba, through this island to the meridian of 83°W and to the Northward along this meridian to the latitude of the South point of the Dry Tortugas (24°35\'N), along this parallel Eastward to Rebecca Shoal (82°35\'W) thence through the shoals and Florida Keys to the mainland at eastern end of Florida Bay, all the narrow waters between the Dry Tortugas and the mainland being considered to be within the Gulf.  Geology  The consensus among geologists   who have studied the geology of the Gulf of Mexico, is that prior to the Late Triassic, the Gulf of Mexico did not exist. Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies Yucatan, within the middle of the large supercontinent of Pangea. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the Marathon Uplift in West Texas and the Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma, and to Alabama where it linked directly to the Appalachian Mountains. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late Cretaceous times by the formation of the Mississippi Embayment.    Geologists and other Earth scientists agree in general that the present Gulf of Mexico basin originated in Late Triassic time as the result of rifting within Pangea. The rifting was associated with zones of weakness within Pangea, including sutures where the Laurentia, South American, and African plates collided to create it. First, there was a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical thickness, 35 kilometers, of normal continental crust. It was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean.

First reference:  Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher who is sometimes referenced on Heroes .  Contents  4 Notes  About  Friedrich Nietzsche, born in 1844 was a philosopher who wrote about religion, morality, culture, philosophy, and science. Some of his main assertions include tragedy as validation of life, an eternal return, and a rejection of Christianity, democracy, and socialism. Between 1883 and 1885, Nietzsche wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra , which in part deals with the idea of the "prophecy" of the Übermensch . Thus Spoke Zarathustra contends that "man is something which ought to be overcome", and posits that the Übermensch is the goal that humanity should set for itself. The Übermensch is sometimes translated as "overman", "superman", or "superhuman".  Nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown in 1890 and died in 1900.  References  Heroes Evolutions  In chapter 6 of Slow Burn , Josh asks Draph what he\'s been up to, and if he\'s still trying to save the world. Draph says that he is working on his dissertation about Nietzsche\'s Overman theory. Even though Draph says that Josh would like it, Josh says he doesn\'t want to be a lab rat.  The "clever" choice for the January 12, 2010, Heroes: Survival event message says, "Remember the teachings of Nietzsche: He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster."

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a nineteenth-century German philosopher. He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, using a distinctive German language style and displaying a fondness for aphorism. Nietzsche\'s influence remains substantial within and beyond philosophy, notably in existentialism and postmodernism.  Thus Spake Zarathustra (Also sprach Zarathustra), is a work composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same", the parable on the "death of God", and the "prophecy" of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science. Described by Nietzsche himself as "the deepest ever written", the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.

Nietzsche\'s work is known more by how it was misinterpreted than by a careful examination of his life and writings. In Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche developed the concept of the ï¿½bermensch or overman, a word incorrectly translated into English as the superman. Born in Rocken, Germany, the son of a Polish Lutheran minister and a German mother, Nietzsche declared there was nothing German about him.

It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic (the Lancashire Loom).  The power loom reduced demand for skilled handweavers, initially causing reduced wages and unemployment. Protests followed its introduction. For example, in 1816 two thousand rioting Calton weavers tried to destroy power loom mills, and stoned the workers.  A darker side of the power loom’s impact was the growth of employment of children in power loom mills.  Relation to Textiles:  Much like the water frame did for spinning, the power loom started automating the process of weaving, though it was a long time until the power loom was fully automatic.  Cartwright’s initial version of the loom was not very commercially successful, but by the 1850s, there were a quarter of a million looms operating in the UK, compared to the 240 that were operating in 1803.  Of course, the power loom, like many of the innovations in weaving, caused a number of riots, and several machines were smashed by workers; eventually, however, the growth in weaving caused a growth in exports and thus a growth in industrial employment, albeit lower-paid employment.  ‹  Power loom | RanklyPower loom | Rankly  Power loom  Ranked #20 on the list Best Invention of All Time  7.20  Inventor:  Patents:  A power loom is a mechanised loom powered by a line shaft. The first power loom was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785. It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic. This was known as the Lancashire Loom. By 1850 there were 260,000 in operation in England. Fifty years later came the Northrop Loom that would replenish the shuttle when it was empty and this replaced the Lancashire loom. The major components of the loom are the warp beam, heddles, harnesses, shuttle, reed and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. With each weaving operation, the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.

The term power loom, corresponds to a mechanized loom powered by a driveshaft . The first power loom was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785, later to be perfected by William Horrocks. It allowed textile making to be done far faster than if a human had done the same work. By 1850, over 250,000 of Cartwright\'s designs were used in England. James Henry Northrop invented the automatic "weft replenishment" loom. It revolutionized the weaving industry. Some 700,000 "Northrop" automatic looms were sold worldwide .  Originally, power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across, but in the early part of the 20th century the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximize production for specific types of material. The most common of these are air-jet looms and water-jet looms.

The number of women joining the research and academic staff in the University continues to grow and, in recent years, the University has appointed its first female Dean, Vice-Principal, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor.  Yet women have only been permitted to study at Scottish universities since 1892, and Glasgow was the scene of many significant achievements in the campaign for women\'s access to higher education.  Jessie Campbell  The movement for the higher education of women began in earnest in Britain and the United States during the 1840s, but progress was slow in Scotland.  The movement had prominent supporters in the West of Scotland, including the University Principal, John Caird, and in April 1877 they founded the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women.  The Association\'s primary aims were to offer women courses of study similar to those available to men at universities, and "to promote generally the higher culture and education of women" with the co-operation of the University of Glasgow.  The founders of the Association included some of the most influential and wealthy women in the West of Scotland, many of whom sat on its General Committee.  Principal Caird was the first Chairman; the Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria and the Marchioness of Lorne, was President, and Mrs Jessie Campbell of Tulliechewan and Mrs Jane Scott were Vice-Presidents.  Janet Galloway  The Association offered lectures by University professors in class rooms at the University and also (from 1878) at St Andrew\'s Halls.  The lectures were initially in Psychology, Logic, Moral Philosophy, French literature and Astronomy, with others such as Modern Literature and Natural Philosophy added later.  Tutorials were offered in the winter, in Latin, Mathematics and the Theory of Music.  Written examinations were set in all subjects, and essays were required for some, as the Association sought to provide courses of study which replicated those for a University Arts degree.  In the first year, more than 318 women attended classes.  In June 1883 the Association was incorporated under the Companies Act as Queen Margaret College, the first and only college in Scotland to provide higher education for women.  It was named for Margaret (d 1093), the wife of King Malcolm III and a patron of arts and literature, who was canonized in 1250, and its aim was "to perform for women work similar to that done by colleges and universities for men."  The first resident secretary and superintendent was Janet Galloway , who had been an Honorary Secretary to the Association from its inception.  Queen Margaret College  The College was housed in North Park House on the banks of the River Kelvin, a splendid mansion which was purchased and gifted by the Glasgow philanthropist Mrs Isabella Elder .  Lecturers were appointed, many of them from the ranks of the University\'s teaching staff, and classes were offered on a wide range of Arts subjects.  More courses were offered in later years; for example, science laboratories were equipped in 1888 for teaching subjects such as Chemistry and Physics.  Isabella Elder  In response to growing demand from women for access to medical education, a medical school was established within the College in 1890 with laboratories, a dissecting room and all the facilities that would be required for teaching.  Mrs Elder agreed to meet the initial running costs of the school and Glasgow Royal Infirmary set aside beds for the clinical instruction of female medical students.  The women were able to study for licences to practice medicine from the Triple Qualification Board of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons in Scotland and the Universities of London and Dublin.  In February 1892 the Scottish Universities Commissioners published an Ordinance authorising the universities to make provision for the instruction and graduation of women.

Film and theater are notably different. In theater, it\'s difficult to see the players and their faces, and thus dialogue and song are used to communicate feelings and motivations. With film you can communicate things more visually, and thus there\'s really no need for such songs.  So the biggest problem with My Fair Lady is that it keeps a lot of fluff songs that really serve no purpose in a film and could easily be disposed of with no harm. Do we really need a whole…  Review by feedingbrett ★★★★  Review In A Nutshell:  My Fair Lady tells the story of an impecunious Cockney woman that has been taken in by a well off, educated man in order to win a bet, transforming her into a presentable woman fit for the upper class society.  My Fair Lady contains an engaging plot that details the polarising levels of society in London, showing the difficulties of poverty and the snobbish attitudes of the rich and pretentious folk when they interact with the lower class.

Experiments were thrown into the mix from time to time, to provide a sense of variance to the genre, but all in all, there is a familiarity to them that may easily loathe or disappoint those who are a connoisseur of the format.

The second way to experience Egypt is from the comfort of your own home: online.  Horus, the God of Kings in Ancient Egypt  Horus, the God of Kings  by Jimmy Dunn  From the very earliest of times, the falcon seems to have been worshipped in Egypt as representative of the greatest cosmic powers. Many falcon gods existed throughout Egypt, though over time, a good number of these assimilated to Horus , the most important of the avian deities. Yet, from all his of many forms, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the "true" Horus. Horus is mostly a general term for a great number of falcon deities.  Horus is one of ancient Egypt\'s best known gods , as well as one of its oldest. His name is attested to from at least the beginning of the Dynastic Period , and depictions of falcon deities on earlier artifacts, such as the Narmer Palette, probably represent this same god. The Turin Canon, which provides some of our most important information on Egypt\'s early history, specifically describes the Predynastic rulers of Egypt as "Followers of Horus".  The use of his name was also widespread in personal names throughout Egyptian history, and Hor, as a personal name, survives into our modern era in a number                   of different forms.  Forms of Horus  Horus is a complicated deity, appearing in many different forms and his mythology is one of the most extensive of all Egyptian deities. Indeed, he has so many different aspects that we must limit our discussion to those that are significant. At the same time, a judicious examination of the various Horuses and the sources relating to them supports the possibility that the roles in question are closely interrelated, and so they may be understood as different aspects of the same divine persona.  The original form of Horus was probably that of a sky god, known as "lord of the sky". The Egyptian word " her" (hor, har), from which the god\'s name is derived means "the one on high", or "the distant one", probably in reference to the soaring flight of the hunting falcon, if not a reference to the solar aspect of the god. Mythologically, the god was imagined as a celestial falcon, whose right eye was the sun and left eye the moon. The speckled feathers of his breast were probably considered to be the stars, while his wings were the sky that created the wind. In this form, Horus was apparently worshipped at some of Egypt\'s earliest shrines such as at Nekhen (Heirakonpolis) , where he was assimilated with a number of other local falcon gods. In this capacity, Horus was the patron of the Nekhen monarchy that grew into the historical pharaonic state and hence, the first known national god.  A natural outgrowth of his role as "lord of the sky" was his aspect as a sun god. An ivory comb of the 1st Dynasty king Den depicts a falcon in a boat riding on outstretched wings, suggesting the falcon traversing the sky as the sun god. The early Pyramid Texts specifically refer to him in solar terms as "god of the east", and he  appears in at least three forms in this guise.  As Horakhty (Harakhty), or "Horus of the two horizons", Horus was the god of the rising and setting sun, but more particularly the god of the east and the sunrise. In the Pyramid Texts , the deceased king is said to be reborn in the eastern sky as Horakhty. Eventually, Horakhty became a part of the Heliopolis sun cult and was fused with its solar god as Re-Horakhty .

It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the "Third Coast" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the "south coast", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the "north coast." One of the gulf\'s seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics.  The Gulf\'s basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nmi wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments. It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba, and with the Caribbean Sea (with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea) via the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba. With the narrow connection to the Atlantic, the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges. The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 (615,000\xa0sq\xa0mi). Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters. The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters (550 quadrillion Imperial gallons, 660 quadrillion US gallons, 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi).   Extent  The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southeast limit of the Gulf of Mexico as follows:   A line leaving Cape Catoche Light () with the Light on Cape San Antonio in Cuba, through this island to the meridian of 83°W and to the Northward along this meridian to the latitude of the South point of the Dry Tortugas (24°35\'N), along this parallel Eastward to Rebecca Shoal (82°35\'W) thence through the shoals and Florida Keys to the mainland at eastern end of Florida Bay, all the narrow waters between the Dry Tortugas and the mainland being considered to be within the Gulf.  Geology  The consensus among geologists   who have studied the geology of the Gulf of Mexico, is that prior to the Late Triassic, the Gulf of Mexico did not exist. Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies Yucatan, within the middle of the large supercontinent of Pangea. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the Marathon Uplift in West Texas and the Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma, and to Alabama where it linked directly to the Appalachian Mountains. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late Cretaceous times by the formation of the Mississippi Embayment.    Geologists and other Earth scientists agree in general that the present Gulf of Mexico basin originated in Late Triassic time as the result of rifting within Pangea. The rifting was associated with zones of weakness within Pangea, including sutures where the Laurentia, South American, and African plates collided to create it. First, there was a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical thickness, 35 kilometers, of normal continental crust. It was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the Gulf of Mexico. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of Louann Salt and associated anhydrite evaporites.

Contents  4 Notes  About  Friedrich Nietzsche, born in 1844 was a philosopher who wrote about religion, morality, culture, philosophy, and science. Some of his main assertions include tragedy as validation of life, an eternal return, and a rejection of Christianity, democracy, and socialism. Between 1883 and 1885, Nietzsche wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra , which in part deals with the idea of the "prophecy" of the Übermensch . Thus Spoke Zarathustra contends that "man is something which ought to be overcome", and posits that the Übermensch is the goal that humanity should set for itself. The Übermensch is sometimes translated as "overman", "superman", or "superhuman".  Nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown in 1890 and died in 1900.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a nineteenth-century German philosopher. He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, using a distinctive German language style and displaying a fondness for aphorism. Nietzsche\'s influence remains substantial within and beyond philosophy, notably in existentialism and postmodernism.  Thus Spake Zarathustra (Also sprach Zarathustra), is a work composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same", the parable on the "death of God", and the "prophecy" of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science. Described by Nietzsche himself as "the deepest ever written", the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.

It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic (the Lancashire Loom).  The power loom reduced demand for skilled handweavers, initially causing reduced wages and unemployment. Protests followed its introduction. For example, in 1816 two thousand rioting Calton weavers tried to destroy power loom mills, and stoned the workers.  A darker side of the power loom’s impact was the growth of employment of children in power loom mills.  Relation to Textiles:  Much like the water frame did for spinning, the power loom started automating the process of weaving, though it was a long time until the power loom was fully automatic.  Cartwright’s initial version of the loom was not very commercially successful, but by the 1850s, there were a quarter of a million looms operating in the UK, compared to the 240 that were operating in 1803.  Of course, the power loom, like many of the innovations in weaving, caused a number of riots, and several machines were smashed by workers; eventually, however, the growth in weaving caused a growth in exports and thus a growth in industrial employment, albeit lower-paid employment.  ‹  Power loom | RanklyPower loom | Rankly  Power loom  Ranked #20 on the list Best Invention of All Time  7.20  Inventor:  Patents:  A power loom is a mechanised loom powered by a line shaft. The first power loom was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785. It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic. This was known as the Lancashire Loom. By 1850 there were 260,000 in operation in England. Fifty years later came the Northrop Loom that would replenish the shuttle when it was empty and this replaced the Lancashire loom. The major components of the loom are the warp beam, heddles, harnesses, shuttle, reed and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. With each weaving operation, the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.

The term power loom, corresponds to a mechanized loom powered by a driveshaft . The first power loom was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785, later to be perfected by William Horrocks. It allowed textile making to be done far faster than if a human had done the same work. By 1850, over 250,000 of Cartwright\'s designs were used in England. James Henry Northrop invented the automatic "weft replenishment" loom. It revolutionized the weaving industry. Some 700,000 "Northrop" automatic looms were sold worldwide .  Originally, power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across, but in the early part of the 20th century the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximize production for specific types of material. The most common of these are air-jet looms and water-jet looms.

Register Here .  Women in the University  Today, nearly 60 per cent of students studying at the University are women.  The number of women joining the research and academic staff in the University continues to grow and, in recent years, the University has appointed its first female Dean, Vice-Principal, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor.  Yet women have only been permitted to study at Scottish universities since 1892, and Glasgow was the scene of many significant achievements in the campaign for women\'s access to higher education.  Jessie Campbell  The movement for the higher education of women began in earnest in Britain and the United States during the 1840s, but progress was slow in Scotland.  The movement had prominent supporters in the West of Scotland, including the University Principal, John Caird, and in April 1877 they founded the Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women.  The Association\'s primary aims were to offer women courses of study similar to those available to men at universities, and "to promote generally the higher culture and education of women" with the co-operation of the University of Glasgow.  The founders of the Association included some of the most influential and wealthy women in the West of Scotland, many of whom sat on its General Committee.  Principal Caird was the first Chairman; the Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria and the Marchioness of Lorne, was President, and Mrs Jessie Campbell of Tulliechewan and Mrs Jane Scott were Vice-Presidents.  Janet Galloway  The Association offered lectures by University professors in class rooms at the University and also (from 1878) at St Andrew\'s Halls.  The lectures were initially in Psychology, Logic, Moral Philosophy, French literature and Astronomy, with others such as Modern Literature and Natural Philosophy added later.  Tutorials were offered in the winter, in Latin, Mathematics and the Theory of Music.  Written examinations were set in all subjects, and essays were required for some, as the Association sought to provide courses of study which replicated those for a University Arts degree.  In the first year, more than 318 women attended classes.  In June 1883 the Association was incorporated under the Companies Act as Queen Margaret College, the first and only college in Scotland to provide higher education for women.  It was named for Margaret (d 1093), the wife of King Malcolm III and a patron of arts and literature, who was canonized in 1250, and its aim was "to perform for women work similar to that done by colleges and universities for men."  The first resident secretary and superintendent was Janet Galloway , who had been an Honorary Secretary to the Association from its inception.  Queen Margaret College  The College was housed in North Park House on the banks of the River Kelvin, a splendid mansion which was purchased and gifted by the Glasgow philanthropist Mrs Isabella Elder .  Lecturers were appointed, many of them from the ranks of the University\'s teaching staff, and classes were offered on a wide range of Arts subjects.  More courses were offered in later years; for example, science laboratories were equipped in 1888 for teaching subjects such as Chemistry and Physics.  Isabella Elder  In response to growing demand from women for access to medical education, a medical school was established within the College in 1890 with laboratories, a dissecting room and all the facilities that would be required for teaching.  Mrs Elder agreed to meet the initial running costs of the school and Glasgow Royal Infirmary set aside beds for the clinical instruction of female medical students.  The women were able to study for licences to practice medicine from the Triple Qualification Board of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons in Scotland and the Universities of London and Dublin.  In February 1892 the Scottish Universities Commissioners published an Ordinance authorising the universities to make provision for the instruction and graduation of women.

Film and theater are notably different. In theater, it\'s difficult to see the players and their faces, and thus dialogue and song are used to communicate feelings and motivations. With film you can communicate things more visually, and thus there\'s really no need for such songs.

North Caucasian Emirate  Flag of the North Caucasian Emirate / Orange Tuesday / wikimedia.org  Despite surviving for just 6 months during the Russian Civil War of 1917-22, the North Caucasian Emirate had a strong design with a crescent moon and stars pointing to its Islamic heritage.  It also must have had the first emoticon in history. These guys were way ahead of their time.  2. Bhutan  Flag of Bhutan / Nightstallion / wikimedia.org  The flag of the mountainous Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan features a mythical Thunder Dragon called Druk, who clutches jewels representing the country’s wealth.  A less informed interpretation might be that Druk is hankering for a snowball fight.  3. Isle of Man  Flag of the Isle of Mann / Nightstallion / wikimedia.org  The three armoured legs (or Triskelion) comes from the 13th century Manx coat of arms, but the symbol itself is derived from Ancient Greece.  Though its exact meaning is unclear, we can only assume that the Manx take their three-legged races very seriously.  4.

Drniš, Croatia  Flag of Drniš / Željko Heimer / wikimedia.org  The small town of Drnis in Croatia chose their flag design as recently as 2000.

At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10.

If you need assistance with writing a research paper on Dante\'s Inferno, Paper Masters can assign one of our professional literary writers to explicate the elements of the Inferno. Below, we give you a sample of how our writer\'s have explained the circles of hell in the Inferno.  Dante’s Inferno is the first part of his epic poem The Divine Comedy , written between 1308 and 1321. The word “Inferno” is Italian for “Hell,” and this part of the work describes the poet’s allegorical journey through the nine circles of Hell. On this journey he is guided by the Roman poet Virgil.  The poem opens with the poet lost in the woods, chased by three beasts, and falling into a deep place. Virgil, who tells Dante that he has been sent by his beloved, deceased Beatrice, rescues him.  The two thus begin their journey through Hell . Each circle is an allegory , frequently representing poetic justice. The first circle of Hell is Limbo, where the unbaptized and virtuous pagans reside. Here Dante meets Homer , Ovid, Cicero and many famous figures from antiquity.  Hell and Dante\'s Inferno  The second circle of Hell is Lust, where the souls of carnal sinners are blackened by an endless wind. In the third circle, Gluttony, a giant worm forces those condemned to lie in a foul mud. These individuals are unaware of their neighbors, indicative of the selfish nature of this sin . The fourth circle, greed, is home to many popes and cardinals, forced to push great weights with their chests.  Wrath, the fifth circle, has sinners fighting each other in the River Styx. Beyond this are the walls of Dis, which separate the deepest pits of Hell, where active (rather than passive) sinners are sent. Heresy, Violence, Fraud and Treachery are the innermost circles of the Inferno.  The City of Dis serves as the gateway to the Nether Hell, separating those guilty of sin by | Question: What Italian author envisioned 9 circles of hell?', ['alighieri', 'dante', 'dante alighieri'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3847'), ("Context: Father Brown -- Mark Williams ( 2013 -- present ) : a slightly crumpled , shambolic and mild - mannered Roman Catholic priest who , by appearance , is easily forgotten .

Since then, the plot of the novel has woven its way into popular culture: Captain Ahab and the hunt for the White Whale continue to spark adaptations, reworkings, and allusions, while the opening line, "Call me Ishmael," remains one of the most well-known first words in fiction. However, Ishmael both as narrator and character has been primarily the property of academic rather than popular culture. Particularly following F. O. Matthiessen s classic American Renaissance, published in 1941 in the midst of the Nazi aggression, Ishmael has been appropriated by critics intent upon finding in him the figure of resistance to totalitarianism and fulfillment of democratic freedom. Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity. But the Holocaust (the Shoah) effectively marks the final collapse of traditional Western humanism. Jewish thinkers such as George Steiner and Emmanuel Levinas have been reassessing this collapse and its consequences. Both suggest alternative Jewish humanisms that reread Western culture and literature through a "Holocaust hermeneutics" that ethicizes and morally impassions the act of reading, studying, and responding to texts, and that elevates the role of the textual and human Other to one of primacy and priority. Rereading Moby-Dick under Steinerian and Levinasian norms reveals an Ishmael whose dealings with the Other pose troubling ethical questions in a post-Shoah world, and challenges the traditional "Cold War consensus" that makes of Ishmael the American emblem of Western freedom and humanitarianism  Subject  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEAHey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEA  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe?  December 18, 2015  CallMeIshmael.jpg  The rotary pay phones used for the Call Me Ishmael project. Photo by Logan Smalley  It started as so many good things do: over a drink. Logan Smalley and Stephanie Kent were at a bar one evening in New York when the conversation turned to books, and specifically, to first sentences of novels. In any such conversation, three words in particular are invariably mentioned: “Call me Ishmael,” the iconic opening of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. What came next was a question that in hindsight, seems unthinkable no one had ever asked before: What if you really could call Ishmael? “We quickly realized that it was a pun worth keeping,” Smalley said.  Smalley and Kent set to work creating Call Me Ishmael , a platform for people to tell personal stories about books they love, with the hopes of connecting people with their next great read. They set up a cell phone number for Ishmael, which goes straight to voice mail and prompts people to anonymously leave a message about “a book you’ve loved and a story you’ve lived.” A few\xa0times a week, Smalley transcribes a message by typewriter, filming the text as it scrolls up the typewriter carriage in time to the audio.  Although Smalley is no literary luddite—he and Kent both read and e-read—he said this particular project called for something more tangible than is typical in our digital age. “[People] want to call a complete stranger and tell them the really profound and potentially really personal story about how a book has affected them,” said Smalley. “That exchange, to us, necessitates something that feels very handmade and safe and comfortable, and gets a legitimate treatment.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. | Question: The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?', ['distinction'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10042'), ('Context: Theatre Notables Sondheim, Ziegfield, Simon & More Amongst ...Theatre Notables Sondheim, Ziegfield, Simon & More Amongst \'New York City 400\'  Theatre Notables Sondheim, Ziegfield, Simon & More Amongst \'New York City 400\'  Tweet Share \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0  The NYC400 is the first-ever list of New York City\'s ultimate movers and shakers since the City\'s founding-from politics, the arts, business, sports, science, and entertainment.

Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074'), ('Context: Tara Strong  Tara Strong (born Tara Lyn Charendoff; February 12, 1973) is a Canadian–American actress who has done voice work for numerous animations and video games and performed in various live-action productions.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

The first act of Sunday in the Park With George occurs with Seurat the artist creating and perfecting his painting. The creative musical theatre artists who were inspired by this painting drew the other characters in Act One from figures in the painting.

What’s Going On? According to Sondheim and Lapine  The painting’s setting is the island of la Grande Jatte, which is located northwest of Paris in the Seine River. In 1884 (when Seurat began working on his painting), the island was a pastoral place where people could go to get away from city life.

At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10.

If you need assistance with writing a research paper on Dante\'s Inferno, Paper Masters can assign one of our professional literary writers to explicate the elements of the Inferno. Below, we give you a sample of how our writer\'s have explained the circles of hell in the Inferno.  Dante’s Inferno is the first part of his epic poem The Divine Comedy , written between 1308 and 1321. The word “Inferno” is Italian for “Hell,” and this part of the work describes the poet’s allegorical journey through the nine circles of Hell. On this journey he is guided by the Roman poet Virgil.  The poem opens with the poet lost in the woods, chased by three beasts, and falling into a deep place. Virgil, who tells Dante that he has been sent by his beloved, deceased Beatrice, rescues him.  The two thus begin their journey through Hell . Each circle is an allegory , frequently representing poetic justice. The first circle of Hell is Limbo, where the unbaptized and virtuous pagans reside. Here Dante meets Homer , Ovid, Cicero and many famous figures from antiquity.  Hell and Dante\'s Inferno  The second circle of Hell is Lust, where the souls of carnal sinners are blackened by an endless wind. In the third circle, Gluttony, a giant worm forces those condemned to lie in a foul mud. These individuals are unaware of their neighbors, indicative of the selfish nature of this sin . The fourth circle, greed, is home to many popes and cardinals, forced to push great weights with their chests.  Wrath, the fifth circle, has sinners fighting each other in the River Styx. Beyond this are the walls of Dis, which separate the deepest pits of Hell, where active (rather than passive) sinners are sent. Heresy, Violence, Fraud and Treachery are the innermost circles of the Inferno.  The City of Dis serves as the gateway to the Nether Hell, separating those guilty of sin by | Question: What Italian author envisioned 9 circles of hell?', ['alighieri', 'dante', 'dante alighieri'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3847'), ("Context: Father Brown -- Mark Williams ( 2013 -- present ) : a slightly crumpled , shambolic and mild - mannered Roman Catholic priest who , by appearance , is easily forgotten .

Since then, the plot of the novel has woven its way into popular culture: Captain Ahab and the hunt for the White Whale continue to spark adaptations, reworkings, and allusions, while the opening line, "Call me Ishmael," remains one of the most well-known first words in fiction. However, Ishmael both as narrator and character has been primarily the property of academic rather than popular culture. Particularly following F. O. Matthiessen s classic American Renaissance, published in 1941 in the midst of the Nazi aggression, Ishmael has been appropriated by critics intent upon finding in him the figure of resistance to totalitarianism and fulfillment of democratic freedom. Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity. But the Holocaust (the Shoah) effectively marks the final collapse of traditional Western humanism. Jewish thinkers such as George Steiner and Emmanuel Levinas have been reassessing this collapse and its consequences. Both suggest alternative Jewish humanisms that reread Western culture and literature through a "Holocaust hermeneutics" that ethicizes and morally impassions the act of reading, studying, and responding to texts, and that elevates the role of the textual and human Other to one of primacy and priority. Rereading Moby-Dick under Steinerian and Levinasian norms reveals an Ishmael whose dealings with the Other pose troubling ethical questions in a post-Shoah world, and challenges the traditional "Cold War consensus" that makes of Ishmael the American emblem of Western freedom and humanitarianism  Subject  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEAHey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEA  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe?

Logan Smalley and Stephanie Kent were at a bar one evening in New York when the conversation turned to books, and specifically, to first sentences of novels. In any such conversation, three words in particular are invariably mentioned: “Call me Ishmael,” the iconic opening of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. What came next was a question that in hindsight, seems unthinkable no one had ever asked before: What if you really could call Ishmael? “We quickly realized that it was a pun worth keeping,” Smalley said.  Smalley and Kent set to work creating Call Me Ishmael , a platform for people to tell personal stories about books they love, with the hopes of connecting people with their next great read. They set up a cell phone number for Ishmael, which goes straight to voice mail and prompts people to anonymously leave a message about “a book you’ve loved and a story you’ve lived.” A few\xa0times a week, Smalley transcribes a message by typewriter, filming the text as it scrolls up the typewriter carriage in time to the audio.  Although Smalley is no literary luddite—he and Kent both read and e-read—he said this particular project called for something more tangible than is typical in our digital age. “[People] want to call a complete stranger and tell them the really profound and potentially really personal story about how a book has affected them,” said Smalley. “That exchange, to us, necessitates something that feels very handmade and safe and comfortable, and gets a legitimate treatment.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is "that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa "have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that "imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. | Question: The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?', ['distinction'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10042'), ('Context: Theatre Notables Sondheim, Ziegfield, Simon & More Amongst ...Theatre Notables Sondheim, Ziegfield, Simon & More Amongst \'New York City 400\'  Theatre Notables Sondheim, Ziegfield, Simon & More Amongst \'New York City 400\'  Tweet Share \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0  The NYC400 is the first-ever list of New York City\'s ultimate movers and shakers since the City\'s founding-from politics, the arts, business, sports, science, and entertainment.

Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.

I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

The Fylde Coast is a coastal plain in western Lancashire. It is roughly a 13-mile (20-kilometre)square-shaped peninsula, bounded by Morecambe Bay to the north, the Ribble estuary to the south, the Irish Sea to the west, and the Bowland hills to the east. The eastern boundary is approximately the location of the M6 motorway.  It is a flat, alluvial plain, parts were once dug for peat, and it is the western part of an area formerly known as\xa0Amounderness. The name \'Fylde\' is of Scandinavian origin, meaning "field".  The west coast is almost entirely urban, consisting of the towns of Fleetwood, Cleveleys, Blackpool and Lytham St Annes, with the villages of Wrea Green, Poulton-le-Fylde and Kirkham not far inland.  The River Wyre meanders across the Fylde from Garstang on the eastern edge, westwards towards Poulton and then northwards to the sea at Fleetwood. The area north and east of the tidal Wyre, known as Over Wyre, is the more rural side of the river. The Fylde peninsula is roughly trisected by the M55 motorway and the A586 road.  The Borough of Fylde is a local government area covering the south of the Fylde plain. The rest is covered by the boroughs of Wyre and Blackpool respectively. The local justice area covering all of the Fylde is called Fylde Coast.

From my research, I believe a young  music enthusiast from the Monterey area, who had attended the Monterey Jazz  Festival thought it would be great to present a Pop music festival similar to the  Jazz festival. As he started his quest, one of the first acts he contacted was the Mama\'s & the Papa\'s.  When Lou Adler and John Phillips found that the young man simply didn\'t have the resources to effectively produce and promote this type of event, they stepped in to help and eventually bought the young man out.  1967  Look Closely, This photo shows the spot where Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival.

An aerial view of the packed arena at The Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday June 17th, 1967. Its amazing that this little arena still looks almost exactly like it did 45 years ago.  The \'67 festival started on a Friday evening and ended late on Sunday night. In between, Music History was made.  Sunday, June 18  With two huge singles behind them, the Airplane was one of the  major attractions of the festival.  The Who  Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of "My Generation", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction". The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died 6 months later in a plane crash at the age of 26.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas.

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule. The United States joined the war on the side of South     Vietnam in 1961, but withdrew combat troops in 1973. In 1975 North Vietnam     succeeded in taking control of South Vietnam.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.

The Fylde Coast is a coastal plain in western Lancashire. It is roughly a 13-mile (20-kilometre)square-shaped peninsula, bounded by Morecambe Bay to the north, the Ribble estuary to the south, the Irish Sea to the west, and the Bowland hills to the east. The eastern boundary is approximately the location of the M6 motorway.  It is a flat, alluvial plain, parts were once dug for peat, and it is the western part of an area formerly known as\xa0Amounderness. The name \'Fylde\' is of Scandinavian origin, meaning "field".  The west coast is almost entirely urban, consisting of the towns of Fleetwood, Cleveleys, Blackpool and Lytham St Annes, with the villages of Wrea Green, Poulton-le-Fylde and Kirkham not far inland.  The River Wyre meanders across the Fylde from Garstang on the eastern edge, westwards towards Poulton and then northwards to the sea at Fleetwood. The area north and east of the tidal Wyre, known as Over Wyre, is the more rural side of the river. The Fylde peninsula is roughly trisected by the M55 motorway and the A586 road.  The Borough of Fylde is a local government area covering the south of the Fylde plain. The rest is covered by the boroughs of Wyre and Blackpool respectively. The local justice area covering all of the Fylde is called Fylde Coast.

Sunday, June 18  With two huge singles behind them, the Airplane was one of the  major attractions of the festival.  The Who  Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of "My Generation", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction".

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ("Context: Military Conflicts in U.S. History - InfopleaseMilitary Conflicts in U.S.     History  United States > Military Affairs > American Wars  Military Conflicts in U.S. History  This page provides information about military conflicts involving the United States; including the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Indian Wars, Dominican Republic, Bosnia, and more.  American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea.

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)

Mythology, propaganda, Liz Taylor and the real Queen of the Nile  The Egyptian queen frequently surrounded herself with splendor, but luxury was less an indulgence than a political tool. ("Anthony and Cleopatra" by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1885)  smithsonian.com  March 31, 2007  The struggle with her teenage brother over the throne of Egypt was not going as well as Cleopatra VII had hoped. In 49 B.C., Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII—also her husband and, by the terms of their father\'s will, her co-ruler—had driven his sister from the palace at Alexandria after Cleopatra attempted to make herself the sole sovereign. The queen, then in her early twenties, fled to Syria and returned with a mercenary army, setting up camp just outside the capital.  Related Books  Rehabilitating Cleopatra  Meanwhile, pursuing a military rival who had fled to Egypt, the Roman general Julius Caesar arrived at Alexandria in the summer of 48 B.C., and found himself drawn into the Egyptian family feud. For decades Egypt had been a subservient ally to Rome, and preserving the stability of the Nile Valley, with its great agricultural wealth, was in Rome\'s economic interest. Caesar took up residence at Alexandria\'s royal palace and summoned the warring siblings for a peace conference, which he planned to arbitrate. But Ptolemy XIII\'s forces barred the return of the king\'s sister to Alexandria. Aware that Caesar\'s diplomatic intervention could help her regain the throne, Cleopatra hatched a scheme to sneak herself into the palace for an audience with Caesar. She persuaded her servant Apollodoros to wrap her in a carpet (or, according to some sources, a sack used for storing bedclothes), which he then presented to the 52-year old Roman.  The image of young Cleopatra tumbling out of an unfurled carpet has been dramatized in nearly every film about her, from the silent era to a 1999 TV miniseries, but it was also a key scene in the real Cleopatra\'s staging of her own life. "She was clearly using all her talents from the moment she arrived on the world stage before Caesar," says Egyptologist Joann Fletcher, author of a forthcoming biography, Cleopatra the Great.  Cleopatra and Ceasar by Jean-Léon Gérôme portrays the scene in which Cleopatra emerges from the carpet—probably somewhat disheveled, but dressed in her best finery—and begs Caesar for aid, the gesture that won over Rome\'s future dictator-for-life. With his help Cleopatra regained Egypt\'s throne.

Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance.

The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts. There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

It was released on April 19, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was her final studio album with the record company, marking the end of a 25-year recording history. Madonna started working on the album in early 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, The Neptunes and Nate "Danja" Hills. The album has an overall R&B vibe, while remaining a dance-pop record at its core. The Pet Shop Boys were also asked to collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros., but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation.  Madonna became interested in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but the basis of the development was Pharrell Williams\' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the process of developing the album.  Madonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art, and call it the same, but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial. She instead named the album "Hard Candy", which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness. Critical reaction to the album were generally favorable, though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market. On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best-selling album worldwide of 2008. The album has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide.  Three singles were released from the album. The first, "4 Minutes", was a worldwide success, topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna\'s 37th Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit. Other singles released were "Give It 2 Me" and "Miles Away". To promote the album, Madonna went on a small promotional tour, where she played in three cities in small venues. The album received the majority of its promotion from the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, which went on to become the highest grossing tour ever by a solo female artist.  Background and development  In February 2007, Timbaland said that he was working with Madonna for her upcoming eleventh studio album.  It was Madonna\'s last studio album for Warner Bros. Records, and following the release of a greatest hits collection (Celebration), she would join Live Nation Artists, a new initiative launched by concert promoter Live Nation. The 10-year deal with Live Nation encompassed all of Madonna\'s future music and music-related businesses, including the exploitation of the Madonna brand, new studio albums, touring, merchandising, fan clubs/Web sites, DVDs, music-related television and film projects and associated sponsorship agreements. In August 2007, Timbaland spoke about the development of the album to MTV News. Together he and Justin Timberlake were confirmed to have worked on the album with Madonna and said that they wrote ten songs for her. Songs confirmed to have been developed were "La, La" and "Candy Shop", which was written by Pharrell Williams.  Timbaland added,  "Me and Justin did the records. [Madonna\'s] got a hot album.

In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.  The west consists largely of poor subsoils and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket bog, whereas the east is largely a limestone landscape.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

The Spanish Language in Mexico  Mexico is the largest Spanish speaking country in the world. It is not surprising then to find that there are a variety of different Spanish dialects spoken throughout the territory. The Aztec language Nahuatl has lent many words to Spanish in Mexico and may have influenced the Mexican Spanish trait of pronouncing all consonants (as opposed to many Central American accents). In certain areas other indigenous languages or the origin of the Spanish settlers has affected the dialect in very specific ways.  Special words and expressions  More VeinteMundos’ articles here .  Other languages spoken  Nahuatl – the most important Amerindian language, spoken by 1.5 million people. Mayan languages such as Tzotzil, Tzetzal and Chol follow, and they are spoken by close to 800,000 people in total. Other indigenous languages include Mixtec, Zapothec, Otomi, Mazatec. However in total, there are close to 300 different languages listed for Mexico.  Mexican law grants all native languages, regardless of the number of speakers or their origin, the same status as Spanish as a “National Language”.  For example, Kickapoo, a language spoken by Native Americans who emigrated to Mexico, is considered a national language.  English – there are over 1,000,000 U.S. citizens that live in Mexico. This presence of this group, combined with the fact that Mexico shares a border with the U.S., make English the second most common language spoken (especially in areas close to the border).  Arabic – spoken by 400,000 people in Mexico  German – close to 80,000 German-speaking Mennonites currently reside in Mexico.  Spanish dialects and variations  Around 10 different linguistic varieties of Spanish exist in Mexico. Although the greatest variations of dialects exist from North to South, there are also differences between the coast and inland and even from town to town.  Due to Mexico City’s importance as an administrative center of Colonial Spain, the Spanish that developed there retained many characteristics of Castilian Spanish.  Southern Spanish in Mexico is perhaps the most extreme, as northern dialects have clear pronunciation and are considered more ‘correct’. Dialects vary more in the South, although on the coast, the language is uniform regardless of the dialects spoken inland. In some regions close to Guatemala, ‘voseo’ co-exists with ‘tuteo’.  Spanish spoken on the Yucatan Peninsula in the southeast of Mexico is unique in every linguistic aspect. Close to 40% of the population in this region still speak Mayan languages and these have greatly affected the Spanish. Consonants are pronounced differently and many Mayan words are incorporated into everyday language.  Geography and Climate  Mexico is the 14th largest country in the world and its terrain is varied with mountains, deserts, lush tropical forests, and many islands in the Pacific (Gulf of California) and the Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean). It is crossed from north to south by the Sierra Madre mountain ranges, while the coastal areas are flatter. Southern Mexico has a tropical climate (except in higher altitudes) whereas the north experiences some seasonal change, with cooler temperatures in the winter. The north, and especially the northwest, is much drier than the south, which has significant rainfall during the wet season.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities "by ancient usage" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891.

The Second World War was far from over, yet those countries were looking for ways and means to reconstruct their systems of education once peace was restored. Very quickly, the project gained momentum and soon took on a universal note. New governments, including that of the United States, decided to join in.  Upon the proposal of CAME, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945. Scarcely had the war ended when the conference opened. It gathered together the representatives of forty-four countries who decided to create an organization that would embody a genuine culture of peace. In their eyes, the new organization must establish the “intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind” and, in so doing, prevent the outbreak of another world war.  At the end of the conference, thirty-seven countries founded the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Constitution of UNESCO , signed on 16 November 1945, came into force on 4 November 1946 after ratification by twenty countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Lebanon, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States.

They called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the name, whose precise origin is contested, nevertheless indicates the chief source of their inspiration. Disenchanted with contemporary academic painting—most of them were colleagues at the Royal Academy of Art and famously disparaged the Academy’s founding president, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), as “Sir Sloshua”—the Brotherhood instead emulated the art of late medieval and early Renaissance Europe until the time of Raphael, an art characterized by minute description of detail, a luminous palette of bright colors that recalls the tempera paint used by medieval artists, and subject matter of a noble, religious, or moralizing nature. In mid-nineteenth-century England, a period marked by political upheaval, mass industrialization, and social ills, the Brotherhood at its inception strove to transmit a message of artistic renewal and moral reform by imbuing their art with seriousness, sincerity, and truth to nature.  At London’s Royal Academy and Free Exhibition shows of 1849, several paintings were exhibited with the cryptic initials “P.R.B.” along with the artists’ signatures; among these were Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother, Slain in a Skirmish between the Colonna and Orsini Factions (private collection) by William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Isabella (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) by John Everett Millais (1829–1896), and the Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate, London) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). These canvases, though diverse in subject, embodied the Brotherhood’s initial aims in their keen observation of the natural world and depiction of subjects that lead the viewer to contemplate moral issues of justice, piety, familial relationships, and the struggle of purity against corruption.  Hunt’s work illustrates a passage from a popular Victorian novel, set in fourteenth-century Rome, by Bulwer Lytton, and is characterized by a careful description of the outdoor setting. Millais’ Isabella is based on John Keats’ retelling of a story from Boccaccio’s Decameron; the artist re-creates in sumptuous detail the tastes and textures of a medieval banquet, from the creased tablecloth strewn with nutshells to guests at the grandly arrayed gathering. In his portrayal of the life of the Virgin, Rossetti employs an archaizing style and symbolic elements associated with early Renaissance painting: the lily , representing purity, the dove of the Holy Spirit, and the cruciform trellis. Other founding members of the Brotherhood—James Collinson (1825–1881; he resigned after converting to Catholicism in 1850), William Michael Rossetti (1829–1919), Frederic George Stephens (1827–1907), and the sculptor Thomas Woolner (1825–1892)—exhibited less frequently than its three prolific leading members.  The works of the Pre-Raphaelites met with critical opposition to their pietism, archaizing compositions, intensely sharp focus—which, with an absence of shadows, flattened the depicted forms—and the stark coloration they achieved by painting on a wet white ground. They had, however, several important champions.

Mythology, propaganda, Liz Taylor and the real Queen of the Nile  The Egyptian queen frequently surrounded herself with splendor, but luxury was less an indulgence than a political tool. ("Anthony and Cleopatra" by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, 1885)  smithsonian.com  March 31, 2007  The struggle with her teenage brother over the throne of Egypt was not going as well as Cleopatra VII had hoped. In 49 B.C., Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII—also her husband and, by the terms of their father\'s will, her co-ruler—had driven his sister from the palace at Alexandria after Cleopatra attempted to make herself the sole sovereign. The queen, then in her early twenties, fled to Syria and returned with a mercenary army, setting up camp just outside the capital.  Related Books  Rehabilitating Cleopatra  Meanwhile, pursuing a military rival who had fled to Egypt, the Roman general Julius Caesar arrived at Alexandria in the summer of 48 B.C., and found himself drawn into the Egyptian family feud. For decades Egypt had been a subservient ally to Rome, and preserving the stability of the Nile Valley, with its great agricultural wealth, was in Rome\'s economic interest. Caesar took up residence at Alexandria\'s royal palace and summoned the warring siblings for a peace conference, which he planned to arbitrate. But Ptolemy XIII\'s forces barred the return of the king\'s sister to Alexandria. Aware that Caesar\'s diplomatic intervention could help her regain the throne, Cleopatra hatched a scheme to sneak herself into the palace for an audience with Caesar. She persuaded her servant Apollodoros to wrap her in a carpet (or, according to some sources, a sack used for storing bedclothes), which he then presented to the 52-year old Roman.  The image of young Cleopatra tumbling out of an unfurled carpet has been dramatized in nearly every film about her, from the silent era to a 1999 TV miniseries, but it was also a key scene in the real Cleopatra\'s staging of her own life. "She was clearly using all her talents from the moment she arrived on the world stage before Caesar," says Egyptologist Joann Fletcher, author of a forthcoming biography, Cleopatra the Great.  Cleopatra and Ceasar by Jean-Léon Gérôme portrays the scene in which Cleopatra emerges from the carpet—probably somewhat disheveled, but dressed in her best finery—and begs Caesar for aid, the gesture that won over Rome\'s future dictator-for-life. With his help Cleopatra regained Egypt\'s throne.

It\'s an irrelevant question, says biographer Joann Fletcher. "The impact she made on the ancient world is overlooked, because the world has this obsession when it comes to women. People can only judge them on whether they were beautiful.

Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound.

There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

It was released on April 19, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was her final studio album with the record company, marking the end of a 25-year recording history. Madonna started working on the album in early 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, The Neptunes and Nate "Danja" Hills. The album has an overall R&B vibe, while remaining a dance-pop record at its core. The Pet Shop Boys were also asked to collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros., but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation.  Madonna became interested in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but the basis of the development was Pharrell Williams\' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the process of developing the album.  Madonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art, and call it the same, but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial. She instead named the album "Hard Candy", which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness. Critical reaction to the album were generally favorable, though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market. On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best-selling album worldwide of 2008. The album has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide.  Three singles were released from the album. The first, "4 Minutes", was a worldwide success, topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna\'s 37th Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit. Other singles released were "Give It 2 Me" and "Miles Away". To promote the album, Madonna went on a small promotional tour, where she played in three cities in small venues. The album received the majority of its promotion from the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, which went on to become the highest grossing tour ever by a solo female artist.  Background and development  In February 2007, Timbaland said that he was working with Madonna for her upcoming eleventh studio album.  It was Madonna\'s last studio album for Warner Bros. Records, and following the release of a greatest hits collection (Celebration), she would join Live Nation Artists, a new initiative launched by concert promoter Live Nation. The 10-year deal with Live Nation encompassed all of Madonna\'s future music and music-related businesses, including the exploitation of the Madonna brand, new studio albums, touring, merchandising, fan clubs/Web sites, DVDs, music-related television and film projects and associated sponsorship agreements. In August 2007, Timbaland spoke about the development of the album to MTV News. Together he and Justin Timberlake were confirmed to have worked on the album with Madonna and said that they wrote ten songs for her. Songs confirmed to have been developed were "La, La" and "Candy Shop", which was written by Pharrell Williams.  Timbaland added,  "Me and Justin did the records. [Madonna\'s] got a hot album. Her album is up there with Justin\'s album. [...] Ah, man, there\'s this one song, we taking it back to \'You must be my luck-eee starrrr!\' ... Remember \'Ugly\' by Bubba Sparxxx?

In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.  The west consists largely of poor subsoils and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket bog, whereas the east is largely a limestone landscape.  Agricultural land is therefore more productive in the east than in the west.  *The highest point in Mayo (and Connacht) is Mweelrea, at 814 m  *The River Moy in the northeast of the county is renowned for its salmon fishing  *Ireland\'s largest island, Achill Island, lies off Mayo\'s west coast  *Mayo has Ireland\'s highest cliffs at Croaghaun, Achill Island,  while the Benwee Head cliffs in Kilcommon Erris drop almost perpendicularly 900 ft into the Atlantic Ocean.   )  *The northwest areas of County Mayo have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, if not the world, in terms of wind resources, ocean wave, tidal and hydroelectric resources     Local government and political subdivisions  Mayo County Council () is the authority responsible for local government.  As a county council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

The Spanish Language in Mexico  Mexico is the largest Spanish speaking country in the world. It is not surprising then to find that there are a variety of different Spanish dialects spoken throughout the territory. The Aztec language Nahuatl has lent many words to Spanish in Mexico and may have influenced the Mexican Spanish trait of pronouncing all consonants (as opposed to many Central American accents). In certain areas other indigenous languages or the origin of the Spanish settlers has affected the dialect in very specific ways.  Special words and expressions  More VeinteMundos’ articles here .  Other languages spoken  Nahuatl – the most important Amerindian language, spoken by 1.5 million people. Mayan languages such as Tzotzil, Tzetzal and Chol follow, and they are spoken by close to 800,000 people in total. Other indigenous languages include Mixtec, Zapothec, Otomi, Mazatec. However in total, there are close to 300 different languages listed for Mexico.  Mexican law grants all native languages, regardless of the number of speakers or their origin, the same status as Spanish as a “National Language”.  For example, Kickapoo, a language spoken by Native Americans who emigrated to Mexico, is considered a national language.  English – there are over 1,000,000 U.S. citizens that live in Mexico. This presence of this group, combined with the fact that Mexico shares a border with the U.S., make English the second most common language spoken (especially in areas close to the border).  Arabic – spoken by 400,000 people in Mexico  German – close to 80,000 German-speaking Mennonites currently reside in Mexico.  Spanish dialects and variations  Around 10 different linguistic varieties of Spanish exist in Mexico. Although the greatest variations of dialects exist from North to South, there are also differences between the coast and inland and even from town to town.  Due to Mexico City’s importance as an administrative center of Colonial Spain, the Spanish that developed there retained many characteristics of Castilian Spanish.  Southern Spanish in Mexico is perhaps the most extreme, as northern dialects have clear pronunciation and are considered more ‘correct’. Dialects vary more in the South, although on the coast, the language is uniform regardless of the dialects spoken inland. In some regions close to Guatemala, ‘voseo’ co-exists with ‘tuteo’.  Spanish spoken on the Yucatan Peninsula in the southeast of Mexico is unique in every linguistic aspect. Close to 40% of the population in this region still speak Mayan languages and these have greatly affected the Spanish. Consonants are pronounced differently and many Mayan words are incorporated into everyday language.  Geography and Climate  Mexico is the 14th largest country in the world and its terrain is varied with mountains, deserts, lush tropical forests, and many islands in the Pacific (Gulf of California) and the Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean). It is crossed from north to south by the Sierra Madre mountain ranges, while the coastal areas are flatter. Southern Mexico has a tropical climate (except in higher altitudes) whereas the north experiences some seasonal change, with cooler temperatures in the winter. The north, and especially the northwest, is much drier than the south, which has significant rainfall during the wet season.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities "by ancient usage" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891.

The Second World War was far from over, yet those countries were looking for ways and means to reconstruct their systems of education once peace was restored. Very quickly, the project gained momentum and soon took on a universal note. New governments, including that of the United States, decided to join in.  Upon the proposal of CAME, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945. Scarcely had the war ended when the conference opened. It gathered together the representatives of forty-four countries who decided to create an organization that would embody a genuine culture of peace. In their eyes, the new organization must establish the “intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind” and, in so doing, prevent the outbreak of another world war.  At the end of the conference, thirty-seven countries founded the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Constitution of UNESCO , signed on 16 November 1945, came into force on 4 November 1946 after ratification by twenty countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Lebanon, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. The first session of the General Conference of UNESCO was held in Paris from 19 November to 10 December 1946 with the participation of representatives from 30 governments entitled to vote.  The political divisions of the Second World War\xa0marked the composition of the founding Member States of UNESCO.

They called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the name, whose precise origin is contested, nevertheless indicates the chief source of their inspiration. Disenchanted with contemporary academic painting—most of them were colleagues at the Royal Academy of Art and famously disparaged the Academy’s founding president, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), as “Sir Sloshua”—the Brotherhood instead emulated the art of late medieval and early Renaissance Europe until the time of Raphael, an art characterized by minute description of detail, a luminous palette of bright colors that recalls the tempera paint used by medieval artists, and subject matter of a noble, religious, or moralizing nature. In mid-nineteenth-century England, a period marked by political upheaval, mass industrialization, and social ills, the Brotherhood at its inception strove to transmit a message of artistic renewal and moral reform by imbuing their art with seriousness, sincerity, and truth to nature.  At London’s Royal Academy and Free Exhibition shows of 1849, several paintings were exhibited with the cryptic initials “P.R.B.” along with the artists’ signatures; among these were Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother, Slain in a Skirmish between the Colonna and Orsini Factions (private collection) by William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Isabella (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) by John Everett Millais (1829–1896), and the Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate, London) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). These canvases, though diverse in subject, embodied the Brotherhood’s initial aims in their keen observation of the natural world and depiction of subjects that lead the viewer to contemplate moral issues of justice, piety, familial relationships, and the struggle of purity against corruption.  Hunt’s work illustrates a passage from a popular Victorian novel, set in fourteenth-century Rome, by Bulwer Lytton, and is characterized by a careful description of the outdoor setting. Millais’ Isabella is based on John Keats’ retelling of a story from Boccaccio’s Decameron; the artist re-creates in sumptuous detail the tastes and textures of a medieval banquet, from the creased tablecloth strewn with nutshells to guests at the grandly arrayed gathering. In his portrayal of the life of the Virgin, Rossetti employs an archaizing style and symbolic elements associated with early Renaissance painting: the lily , representing purity, the dove of the Holy Spirit, and the cruciform trellis. Other founding members of the Brotherhood—James Collinson (1825–1881; he resigned after converting to Catholicism in 1850), William Michael Rossetti (1829–1919), Frederic George Stephens (1827–1907), and the sculptor Thomas Woolner (1825–1892)—exhibited less frequently than its three prolific leading members.  The works of the Pre-Raphaelites met with critical opposition to their pietism, archaizing compositions, intensely sharp focus—which, with an absence of shadows, flattened the depicted forms—and the stark coloration they achieved by painting on a wet white ground. They had, however, several important champions. Foremost among them was the writer John Ruskin (1819–1900), an ardent supporter of painting from nature and a leading | Question: Which nineteenth century artist had the Christian names John Everett?', ['millais'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4081')]

Passion fruit is one of the few antioxidant fruits that not only improves your physical health, but also your mental health. Native to areas ranging form southern Brazil, Paraguay, all the way to Argentina, this fruit can be used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and even sleep disorders like insomnia. Passion fruit comes in two varieties. One is a dark purple color once it has reached maturity and has a less acidic, richer taste. The other turns yellow at maturity and is typically large than the purple kind. Unlike the purple passion fruit, the yellow passion fruit does not have a known origin, although people have speculated that it may be Brazil.  Passion Fruit, Granadilla, Purple Granadilla  Passion fruit goes by many names, its scientific one being Passiflora edulis for the purple fruit and Passiflora edulis flavicarpa for the yellow, while another common name is Granadilla (or Purple Granadilla). Purple passion fruit is a subtropical fruit that will only flower and fruit in altitudes above 3,200 ft. Yellow passion fruit is tropical and can be grown from just above sea level up to the altitude of 2,000 ft. It is interesting that these varieties of passion fruit differ to such a degree. The people of Brazil tend to use the purple fruit to eat raw, while they prefer the yellow fruit for juice extractions and the creation of preserves. Australians absolutely love the purple passion fruit and vastly favor it over the yellow for all preparations.  Passion Fruit to Improve Mental Health  The flowers of the passion fruit vine have been used traditionally in folk medicine as a calming agent, usually for the purpose of helping someone fall asleep. Researchers who published a study in “Phytotherapy Research” were able to find that the flowers had a depressant effect on the nonspecific central nervous system. Another study in “Anesthesia and Analgesia” tested whether the flower could be used to effectively treat anxiety in patients about to undergo surgery. The results were positive – that passion fruit flower can reduce anxiety without necessarily causing sedation.  While passion fruit and its flowers (and even its vine) can have positive effects on your mental health, it is worthwhile to make sure this plant doesn’t have any contraindications with the medicine you’re on. If you’re taking medication regularly, check with your doctor that it’s safe for you to try passion fruit flower before doing it. Better safe than sorry!  Physical Health Benefits  The yellow passion fruit, also known as the maracuya, has traditional medicinal uses as well. Similar to cranberries, its juice can be used to treat urinary tract infections. Passion fruit has also shown potential in treating asthma, thanks in part to its vitamin C and potassium content (although that’s not the only reason). Passion fruit is one of the vitamin, mineral, and fiber rich fruits when it comes down to it. Currently, there is research being done to establish whether passion fruit can fight chronic inflammation. If so, this is just one more benefit to add to the ever-expanding list.  Yellow Passion Fruit, or “maracuyá”  Yellow Passion Fruit, or “maracuyá”  Traditional medicine uses it for urinary tract infections, much like the cranberry .

Subaru cars are known for the use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500\xa0cc. Most Subaru models have used the Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout since 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the Impreza WRX and the Legacy 2.5GT. The 2.5XT trims of the Outback and Forester also include a turbocharged engine.  In Western markets, the Subaru brand has traditionally been popular among a dedicated core of buyers. Marketing is targeted towards a specific niche centered on those who desire the company\'s signature drive train.   Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or "The Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.   History  Fuji Heavy Industries started out as The Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by Chikuhei Nakajima. In 1932, the company was reorganized as Nakajima Aircraft Company, Ltd and soon became a major manufacturer of aircraft for Japan during World War II. At the end of the Second World War Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd. In 1946, the company created the Fuji Rabbit motor scooter with spare aircraft parts from the war.  In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the Japanese Government\'s 1950 Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act, anti-zaibatsu legislation. Between 1953 and 1955, four of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to merge to form Fuji Heavy Industries. These companies were: Fuji Kogyo, a scooter manufacturer; coachbuilders Fuji Jidosha; engine manufacturers Omiya Fuji Kogyo; chassis builders Utsunomiya Sharyo and the Tokyo Fuji Dangyo trading company.   Kenji Kita, CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries at the time, wanted the new company to be involved in car manufacturing and soon began plans for building a car with the development code-name P-1. Mr. Kita canvassed the Company for suggestions about naming the P1, but none of the proposals was appealing enough. In the end he gave the car a Japanese name that he had "been cherishing in his heart": Subaru, which is the name of the Pleiades star cluster in Japanese. The first Subaru car was named the Subaru 1500.  Only twenty P1s were manufactured owing to multiple supply issues. From 1954 to 2008 the company designed and manufactured dozens of vehicles including the 1500 (1954), the tiny air-cooled 360 (1958), the Sambar (1961), the 1000 (which saw the introduction of the Subaru boxer engine in 1965), the R-2 (1969), the Rex and the Leone (1971), the BRAT (1978), Alcyone (1985), the Legacy (1989), the Impreza (1993), the Forester (1997), the Tribeca (2005), the Exiga (2008), and the BRZ (2012).  Major shareholders  Nissan acquired a 20.4% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru\'s parent company, in 1968 during a period of government-ordered merging of the Japanese auto industry in order to improve competitiveness under the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato. Nissan would utilize FHI\'s bus manufacturing capability and expertise for their Nissan Diesel line of buses. In turn many Subaru vehicles, even today, use parts from the Nissan manufacturing keiretsu. The Subaru automatic transmission, known as the 4EAT, is also used in the first generation Nissan Pathfinder.

Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of "Social Darwinism" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

Luxury hotel, Le Badrutt's Palace Hotel, St. Moritz ...Luxury hotel, Le Badrutt's Palace Hotel, St. Moritz, Switzerland - Luxury Dream Hotels  member reviews  Elegant Saint Moritz  Saint Moritz, the elegant resort in the canton of Grisons, has been receiving the crowned heads of Europe for more than a century. This former thermal station, reputed to have 322 days of sunshine a year, is one of the oldest winter sports stations in the world. Saint Moritz began to develop in 1864 when the first ice skaters and curling enthusiasts came here from Scotland to try out its frozen lake. It’s here that skiing, known for centuries in Nordic countries as a means of locomotion, became, thanks to the hotel professional Johannes Badrutt, a sport and a pastime. With its 350 kilometers of slopes, Saint Moritz is the largest skiable resort in the world. On two occasions, in 1928 and 1948, the station hosted the winter Olympics, and in 1935, was the first to create a ski lift. This ultra trendy winter resort is also known as the birthplace of the bobsled, which Prince Albert of Monaco practices here on his visits to Switzerland.

Baloney | Italy In SFMortadella Vs. Baloney | Italy In SF  Mortadella Vs. Baloney  Posted on February 19th, 2009 by Vanessa  First of all, let’s make one thing clear: baloney (or Bologna) and mortadella have nothing in common- other than a very vague resemblance and the fact that baloney is originally inspired by mortadella. Mortadella is a high-end salume served thinly sliced inside focaccia bread (or piadina !) or cut in thick cubes to snack on with an aperitivo . Would you ever eat baloney cubed? That’s what I thought.  While baloney is made with pork scraps, or even chicken, turkey and beef, mortadella is only made from very finely minced high quality pork and cubes of fat “sprinkled” inside. Shelled pistachios and black pepper grains are then added to the mixture which is stuffed into a casing and cooked in brick ovens. In substance, mortadella is a giant sausage- up to 200 pounds!- slowly cooked and then sliced to serve. The best mortadella is the largest, both in cross-section and in weight, and it will have pistachios in it, as well as the coveted EU seal IGP , Protected Geographical Indication. Yes, because the real mortadella also needs to say “Bologna” on it!  There are two school of thoughts on the best mortadella serving. One says that the best mortadella is sliced paper-thin and eaten inside crescente, the Bologna word for focaccia. This way, the mortadella literally melts in your mouth, filling your mouth with a wonderful “soft” taste and a perfume that leaves no one wondering what you had for lunch! Another current says mortadella is better cut really thik, like half-inch slices, and then diced for finger food as an appetizers while you cook dinner, or entertain friends with a glass of good red wine. I have to say real mortadella is always, always good- but I prefer it sliced really thin (while I love my prosciutto hand carved!). A quick and interesting fact about mortadella? Well, 100 grams of mortadella have less cholesterol than the same quantity of chicken. I think I will gladly swapped my diet-savy grilled chicken breast for a thick slice of mortadella- now, if only could a 100 gram serving be enough…  In the Bay Area you an find mortadella in almost all Italian delis and cold cut counters in high-end grocery stores. Out of the top of my head I can think of Zanotto’s , Lucca Delicatessen , A.G. Ferrari , Draeger’s , The Pasta Shop , Bristol Farms , and even Piazza’s .\xa0  Mortadella - How the Sausage is Made - Italy Food TravelMortadella - How the Sausage is Made - Italy Food Travel  by Amber H. | May 19, 2016 | Europe , Italy | 0 comments  shares  There is a saying that goes, “No one wants to see how the sausage is made”. When it comes to mortadella, though, I’ve been desperate to find out how it is made, and the story behind it.  Mortadella – That’s Baloney  Like many kids who grew up in the States, I grew up on bologna sandwiches. I could spot that round plastic container, with the yellow backing, from a mile away. I still remember the sound it made, when that plastic backing was ripped off. The smell of the bologna\xa0when it sizzled in a frying pan is another thing I remember. Yes, my grandmother often made me fried bologna sandwiches, served on white Wonder Bread, with ketchup of course. An all American bologna lunch was served.  As I got older I started to despise bologna, and most of the other lunch meats my mother served me. Liverwurst. Olive loaf. That fake turkey meat. Processed ham. It got to the point where I despised it all.  I grew into an adult with a little bit of processed meat PTSD from my overly bologna saturated childhood.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

Passion fruit is one of the few antioxidant fruits that not only improves your physical health, but also your mental health. Native to areas ranging form southern Brazil, Paraguay, all the way to Argentina, this fruit can be used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and even sleep disorders like insomnia. Passion fruit comes in two varieties. One is a dark purple color once it has reached maturity and has a less acidic, richer taste. The other turns yellow at maturity and is typically large than the purple kind. Unlike the purple passion fruit, the yellow passion fruit does not have a known origin, although people have speculated that it may be Brazil.  Passion Fruit, Granadilla, Purple Granadilla  Passion fruit goes by many names, its scientific one being Passiflora edulis for the purple fruit and Passiflora edulis flavicarpa for the yellow, while another common name is Granadilla (or Purple Granadilla). Purple passion fruit is a subtropical fruit that will only flower and fruit in altitudes above 3,200 ft. Yellow passion fruit is tropical and can be grown from just above sea level up to the altitude of 2,000 ft. It is interesting that these varieties of passion fruit differ to such a degree. The people of Brazil tend to use the purple fruit to eat raw, while they prefer the yellow fruit for juice extractions and the creation of preserves. Australians absolutely love the purple passion fruit and vastly favor it over the yellow for all preparations.  Passion Fruit to Improve Mental Health  The flowers of the passion fruit vine have been used traditionally in folk medicine as a calming agent, usually for the purpose of helping someone fall asleep. Researchers who published a study in “Phytotherapy Research” were able to find that the flowers had a depressant effect on the nonspecific central nervous system. Another study in “Anesthesia and Analgesia” tested whether the flower could be used to effectively treat anxiety in patients about to undergo surgery. The results were positive – that passion fruit flower can reduce anxiety without necessarily causing sedation.  While passion fruit and its flowers (and even its vine) can have positive effects on your mental health, it is worthwhile to make sure this plant doesn’t have any contraindications with the medicine you’re on. If you’re taking medication regularly, check with your doctor that it’s safe for you to try passion fruit flower before doing it. Better safe than sorry!  Physical Health Benefits  The yellow passion fruit, also known as the maracuya, has traditional medicinal uses as well. Similar to cranberries, its juice can be used to treat urinary tract infections. Passion fruit has also shown potential in treating asthma, thanks in part to its vitamin C and potassium content (although that’s not the only reason). Passion fruit is one of the vitamin, mineral, and fiber rich fruits when it comes down to it. Currently, there is research being done to establish whether passion fruit can fight chronic inflammation. If so, this is just one more benefit to add to the ever-expanding list.  Yellow Passion Fruit, or “maracuyá”  Yellow Passion Fruit, or “maracuyá”  Traditional medicine uses it for urinary tract infections, much like the cranberry .

Subaru cars are known for the use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500\xa0cc. Most Subaru models have used the Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout since 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the Impreza WRX and the Legacy 2.5GT. The 2.5XT trims of the Outback and Forester also include a turbocharged engine.  In Western markets, the Subaru brand has traditionally been popular among a dedicated core of buyers. Marketing is targeted towards a specific niche centered on those who desire the company\'s signature drive train.   Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or "The Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.   History  Fuji Heavy Industries started out as The Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by Chikuhei Nakajima. In 1932, the company was reorganized as Nakajima Aircraft Company, Ltd and soon became a major manufacturer of aircraft for Japan during World War II. At the end of the Second World War Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd. In 1946, the company created the Fuji Rabbit motor scooter with spare aircraft parts from the war.  In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the Japanese Government\'s 1950 Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act, anti-zaibatsu legislation. Between 1953 and 1955, four of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to merge to form Fuji Heavy Industries. These companies were: Fuji Kogyo, a scooter manufacturer; coachbuilders Fuji Jidosha; engine manufacturers Omiya Fuji Kogyo; chassis builders Utsunomiya Sharyo and the Tokyo Fuji Dangyo trading company.   Kenji Kita, CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries at the time, wanted the new company to be involved in car manufacturing and soon began plans for building a car with the development code-name P-1. Mr. Kita canvassed the Company for suggestions about naming the P1, but none of the proposals was appealing enough. In the end he gave the car a Japanese name that he had "been cherishing in his heart": Subaru, which is the name of the Pleiades star cluster in Japanese. The first Subaru car was named the Subaru 1500.  Only twenty P1s were manufactured owing to multiple supply issues. From 1954 to 2008 the company designed and manufactured dozens of vehicles including the 1500 (1954), the tiny air-cooled 360 (1958), the Sambar (1961), the 1000 (which saw the introduction of the Subaru boxer engine in 1965), the R-2 (1969), the Rex and the Leone (1971), the BRAT (1978), Alcyone (1985), the Legacy (1989), the Impreza (1993), the Forester (1997), the Tribeca (2005), the Exiga (2008), and the BRZ (2012).  Major shareholders  Nissan acquired a 20.4% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru\'s parent company, in 1968 during a period of government-ordered merging of the Japanese auto industry in order to improve competitiveness under the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato. Nissan would utilize FHI\'s bus manufacturing capability and expertise for their Nissan Diesel line of buses. In turn many Subaru vehicles, even today, use parts from the Nissan manufacturing keiretsu. The Subaru automatic transmission, known as the 4EAT, is also used in the first generation Nissan Pathfinder.

Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of "Social Darwinism" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

Rebecca. London: Victor Gollancz, 1938. Octavo, original black cloth gilt, original dust jacket. Housed in custom clamshell box.  First edition of du Maurier’s most famous novel, her haunting tale of memory and murder, the basis for Alfred Hitchcock’s Oscar-winning 1940 film. An exceptional copy in scarce original dust jacket, with original Book Society belly band.  Du Maurier’s most popular novel, and one that paved the way for a renaissance of romantic mystery in mid-20th century publishing, Rebecca “subtly subverts the classic rags-to-riches or Cinderella theme to provide an eerie… almost Gothic narrative” (Parker & Kermode, 211). The novel proved to critics that “Du Maurier is in a class by herself” (New York Times); her “masterful treatment” of her tale“made Rebecca a classic book” (Steinbrunner & Penzler, 136). “‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.’ The opening line of perhaps the greatest romantic suspense novel ever written has become as familiar to readers as ‘Call me Ishmael’ from Moby-Dick” (Penzler, Crown, 26). Singled out by Haycraft Queen as a Cornerstone mystery, Rebecca has also been chosen by the Mystery Writers of America as number nine in the Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time. Hubin, 128.

Baloney | Italy In SFMortadella Vs. Baloney | Italy In SF  Mortadella Vs. Baloney  Posted on February 19th, 2009 by Vanessa  First of all, let’s make one thing clear: baloney (or Bologna) and mortadella have nothing in common- other than a very vague resemblance and the fact that baloney is originally inspired by mortadella. Mortadella is a high-end salume served thinly sliced inside focaccia bread (or piadina !) or cut in thick cubes to snack on with an aperitivo . Would you ever eat baloney cubed? That’s what I thought.  While baloney is made with pork scraps, or even chicken, turkey and beef, mortadella is only made from very finely minced high quality pork and cubes of fat “sprinkled” inside. Shelled pistachios and black pepper grains are then added to the mixture which is stuffed into a casing and cooked in brick ovens. In substance, mortadella is a giant sausage- up to 200 pounds!- slowly cooked and then sliced to serve. The best mortadella is the largest, both in cross-section and in weight, and it will have pistachios in it, as well as the coveted EU seal IGP , Protected Geographical Indication. Yes, because the real mortadella also needs to say “Bologna” on it!  There are two school of thoughts on the best mortadella serving. One says that the best mortadella is sliced paper-thin and eaten inside crescente, the Bologna word for focaccia. This way, the mortadella literally melts in your mouth, filling your mouth with a wonderful “soft” taste and a perfume that leaves no one wondering what you had for lunch! Another current says mortadella is better cut really thik, like half-inch slices, and then diced for finger food as an appetizers while you cook dinner, or entertain friends with a glass of good red wine. I have to say real mortadella is always, always good- but I prefer it sliced really thin (while I love my prosciutto hand carved!). A quick and interesting fact about mortadella? Well, 100 grams of mortadella have less cholesterol than the same quantity of chicken. I think I will gladly swapped my diet-savy grilled chicken breast for a thick slice of mortadella- now, if only could a 100 gram serving be enough…  In the Bay Area you an find mortadella in almost all Italian delis and cold cut counters in high-end grocery stores. Out of the top of my head I can think of Zanotto’s , Lucca Delicatessen , A.G. Ferrari , Draeger’s , The Pasta Shop , Bristol Farms , and even Piazza’s .\xa0  Mortadella - How the Sausage is Made - Italy Food TravelMortadella - How the Sausage is Made - Italy Food Travel  by Amber H. | May 19, 2016 | Europe , Italy | 0 comments  shares  There is a saying that goes, “No one wants to see how the sausage is made”. When it comes to mortadella, though, I’ve been desperate to find out how it is made, and the story behind it.  Mortadella – That’s Baloney  Like many kids who grew up in the States, I grew up on bologna sandwiches. I could spot that round plastic container, with the yellow backing, from a mile away. I still remember the sound it made, when that plastic backing was ripped off. The smell of the bologna\xa0when it sizzled in a frying pan is another thing I remember. Yes, my grandmother often made me fried bologna sandwiches, served on white Wonder Bread, with ketchup of course. An all American bologna lunch was served.  As I got older I started to despise bologna, and most of the other lunch meats my mother served me. Liverwurst. Olive loaf. That fake turkey meat. Processed ham. It got to the point where I despised it all.  I grew into an adult with a little bit of processed meat PTSD from my overly bologna saturated childhood. As I started to eat Italian cured meats, it took me some time to develop a taste.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

It is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory . The island is located in the Indian Ocean , about 1,600\xa0km (1,000\xa0mi) south of the southern coast of India . [3] The closest other countries to Diego Garcia are Sri Lanka and Maldives .  In the 1960s, the Chagos archipelago was secretly leased to the United Kingdom and detached from Mauritius with the intention of expelling its entire population and establishing a military base. In 1971 the United Kingdom and United States entered an agreement under which the latter would set up a military base in Diego Garcia.  Since then, the United Kingdom enforced the highly controversial depopulation of Diego Garcia , forcing the deportation of all 2,000 inhabitants of the island, who were descendants of African slaves and Hindu labourers brought to the islands by the French in the 18th century, to the surrounding islands, including Mauritius, located 1,200 miles away. In their place, a joint British-American military base was established.  This island has one of the five monitoring stations assisting the operation of the Global Positioning System , the others being on Ascension Island , Hawaii , Kwajalein Atoll and in Colorado Springs .  It is covered in luxuriant tropical vegetation. It is 60\xa0kilometres (37\xa0mi) long, with a maximum elevation of 6.7\xa0metres (22\xa0ft), and nearly encloses a lagoon about 19\xa0kilometres (12\xa0mi) long and up to 8\xa0kilometres (5.0\xa0mi) wide. Depths in the lagoon extend to 30\xa0metres (98\xa0ft), and numerous coral heads present hazards to navigation. Shallow reefs surround the island on the ocean side. The channel and anchorage area are dredged , while the old turning basin can also be used.  Contents  Geography  Location map of Diego Garcia.  The atoll forms a nearly complete rim of land around a lagoon, enclosing 90 percent of its perimeter , with an opening only in the north. The main island is the largest of about sixty islands which form the Chagos Archipelago. Besides the main island, there are three small islets at the mouth of the lagoon:  West Island (3.4 ha /8.4 acres)  Middle Island (6 ha /14.8 acres)  East Island (11.75 ha /29 acres)  A fourth island shown on some maps, Anniversary Island one kilometre southwest of Middle Island, appears as just a sand bar on satellite images. Both Middle Island and Anniversary Island sit on the Spur Reef complex.  The total area of the atoll is 174\xa0km2 (66\xa0mi2) according to [1] , of which 30\xa0km2 (12\xa0mi2) are land, 17\xa0km2 (6.5\xa0mi2) peripheral reef and 124\xa0km2 (48\xa0mi2) are lagoon.  Climate  Eclipse Point  Annual rainfall averages 260\xa0cm (102\xa0in), with the heaviest precipitation from October to February. August, the driest month, averages 100\xa0mm (4.2\xa0in). Temperatures are generally close to 30°C (86 °F) by day, falling to the low 20s °C (70 °F) by night. Humidity is high throughout the year. The almost constant breeze keeps conditions reasonably comfortable.  Diego Garcia is at risk from tropical cyclones . The surrounding topography is low and does not provide an extensive wind break. Since the 1960s the island has not been seriously affected by a severe tropical cyclone, even though it has often been threatened. The maximum sustained wind associated with a tropical cyclone in the period 1970-2000 was approximately 40 knots (75\xa0km/h).  Sunset at Cannon Point  The island was somewhat affected by the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Service personnel on the western arm of the island reported only a minor increase in wave activity. The island was protected to a large degree by its favourable ocean topography. | Question: Which coral atoll, the largest island in the Chagos Archipelago, was forcibly depopulated in 1971 to make way for a joint UK/USA military base?', ['anniversary island', 'diego garcia'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5996'), ("Context: The planet Neptune was mathematically predicted before it was directly observed .

Each of these was associated with a season--Boreas was the cold breath of winter, Zephyros the god of spring breezes, and Notos the god of summer rain-storms.  The Winds were portrayed as either man-shaped, winged gods who lived together in a cavern on Mount Haimos (Haemus) in Thrake (Thrace), or as horse-shaped divinities stabled by Aiolos (Aeolus) Hippotades, "the Reiner of  Horses", on the island of Aiolia and set out to graze on the shores of the earth-encircling River Okeanos (Oceanus).  Early poets, such as Homer and Hesiod, drew a clear distinction between the four, relatively benign, seasonal Winds (Anemoi)  and the destructive Storm-Winds ( Anemoi Thuellai ). The latter, spawned by the monster Typhoeus, were either housed in the caverns of Aiolos or guarded by the Hekatonkheires in the pits of Tartaros . Later authors blurred the distinction between the two.  The female counterparts of the Anemoi were the Aellai Harpyiai (Harpies). Mated with the Winds they produced many  swift, immortal horses.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

From my research, I believe a young  music enthusiast from the Monterey area, who had attended the Monterey Jazz  Festival thought it would be great to present a Pop music festival similar to the  Jazz festival. As he started his quest, one of the first acts he contacted was the Mama\'s & the Papa\'s.  When Lou Adler and John Phillips found that the young man simply didn\'t have the resources to effectively produce and promote this type of event, they stepped in to help and eventually bought the young man out.  1967  Look Closely, This photo shows the spot where Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Hendrix supposedly scratched this himself the night of his performance. It is from this exact same stage where the Monterey Summer of Love Festival - 45 Years Later will take place!  An aerial view of the packed arena at The Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday June 17th, 1967. Its amazing that this little arena still looks almost exactly like it did 45 years ago.  The \'67 festival started on a Friday evening and ended late on Sunday night. In between, Music History was made.  Sunday, June 18  With two huge singles behind them, the Airplane was one of the  major attractions of the festival.  The Who  Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of "My Generation", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction". The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died 6 months later in a plane crash at the age of 26.

Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before.

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission.

Khrushchev dramatically banging his shoe in anger at a 1960 United Nations session...the problem is, for many years, this "common knowledge" has been placed in doubt. There is no photo or other definitive evidence that proves this dramatic moment ever occurred. Image above shows the former Russian leader with a pair of his actual shoes.  Assumptions about common knowledge can be very dangerous. As\xa0the saying goes,\xa0a journalist even needs to check “if\xa0his mother loves him.” It means that reporters need to\xa0test\xa0everything – even\xa0common knowledge- \xa0before presenting it as fact.

General Assembly in 1960, brandishing his shoe at a Filipino delegate who was accusing the U.S.S.R. of imperialism in Eastern Europe.” A Times (London) article says , “October 1960 Nikita Khrushchev, the Russian leader, bangs his shoe on a table at the UN after being accused of imperialism.” Which was it – did he “brandish” his shoe? or did he “bang” it on the table?  The details surrounding the incident are not clear. Johnny Phillips of the News Herald says different news outlets, assigned “three completely different dates and historical circumstances.” Phillips\xa0cites “eye-witness” accounts of the event that vary greatly. Some say he never removed his shoe, others say he threw it, others still say he banged it on the desk.  In 2000, Khrushchev’s granddaughter – fed up with being asked repeatedly about the incident – decided to set the record straight . “It has been 40 years,” she said, “Why are the versions so different? And there are no pictures! What if it had never happened?”  You May Also Like...  BBC won\'t show accused child sex abuser Jimmy Savile on air to protect victims  After the Bush shoe incident, the Toronto Star tried–but failed – to avoid making an error. They still made a factual error by only briefly referencing the Khrushchev antics: “Nikita Khrushchev famously banged his shoe on the desk of the United Nations.” But whether or not the shoe was banged on the table is a disputed fact.  The only verifiable fact is that Khrushchev did something involving a shoe in 1960. Since the whole truth is unknown, reporters need to use qualifying language to clarify that when referencing the event. Using qualifying or distancing language should be the regular practice whenever reporters reference a “common knowledge” event of which the truth is not completely known.  In addition to the way the event should be qualified in the future, news outlets need to go back through their records and correct any previous references to the incident. Phillips is not wrong to suggest this, as the New York Times set the precedent by correcting 12 years worth of stories that erroneously called Senator McCain a “fighter pilot.” Every story from the 12 year period was corrected.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

In the 1960s, the Chagos archipelago was secretly leased to the United Kingdom and detached from Mauritius with the intention of expelling its entire population and establishing a military base. In 1971 the United Kingdom and United States entered an agreement under which the latter would set up a military base in Diego Garcia.  Since then, the United Kingdom enforced the highly controversial depopulation of Diego Garcia , forcing the deportation of all 2,000 inhabitants of the island, who were descendants of African slaves and Hindu labourers brought to the islands by the French in the 18th century, to the surrounding islands, including Mauritius, located 1,200 miles away. In their place, a joint British-American military base was established.

Besides the main island, there are three small islets at the mouth of the lagoon:  West Island (3.4 ha /8.4 acres)  Middle Island (6 ha /14.8 acres)  East Island (11.75 ha /29 acres)  A fourth island shown on some maps, Anniversary Island one kilometre southwest of Middle Island, appears as just a sand bar on satellite images. Both Middle Island and Anniversary Island sit on the Spur Reef complex.  The total area of the atoll is 174\xa0km2 (66\xa0mi2) according to [1] , of which 30\xa0km2 (12\xa0mi2) are land, 17\xa0km2 (6.5\xa0mi2) peripheral reef and 124\xa0km2 (48\xa0mi2) are lagoon.  Climate  Eclipse Point  Annual rainfall averages 260\xa0cm (102\xa0in), with the heaviest precipitation from October to February. August, the driest month, averages 100\xa0mm (4.2\xa0in). Temperatures are generally close to 30°C (86 °F) by day, falling to the low 20s °C (70 °F) by night. Humidity is high throughout the year. The almost constant breeze keeps conditions reasonably comfortable.  Diego Garcia is at risk from tropical cyclones . The surrounding topography is low and does not provide an extensive wind break. Since the 1960s the island has not been seriously affected by a severe tropical cyclone, even though it has often been threatened. The maximum sustained wind associated with a tropical cyclone in the period 1970-2000 was approximately 40 knots (75\xa0km/h).  Sunset at Cannon Point  The island was somewhat affected by the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Service personnel on the western arm of the island reported only a minor increase in wave activity.

Each of these was associated with a season--Boreas was the cold breath of winter, Zephyros the god of spring breezes, and Notos the god of summer rain-storms.  The Winds were portrayed as either man-shaped, winged gods who lived together in a cavern on Mount Haimos (Haemus) in Thrake (Thrace), or as horse-shaped divinities stabled by Aiolos (Aeolus) Hippotades, "the Reiner of  Horses", on the island of Aiolia and set out to graze on the shores of the earth-encircling River Okeanos (Oceanus).  Early poets, such as Homer and Hesiod, drew a clear distinction between the four, relatively benign, seasonal Winds (Anemoi)  and the destructive Storm-Winds ( Anemoi Thuellai ). The latter, spawned by the monster Typhoeus, were either housed in the caverns of Aiolos or guarded by the Hekatonkheires in the pits of Tartaros . Later authors blurred the distinction between the two.  The female counterparts of the Anemoi were the Aellai Harpyiai (Harpies). Mated with the Winds they produced many  swift, immortal horses.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

From my research, I believe a young  music enthusiast from the Monterey area, who had attended the Monterey Jazz  Festival thought it would be great to present a Pop music festival similar to the  Jazz festival. As he started his quest, one of the first acts he contacted was the Mama\'s & the Papa\'s.  When Lou Adler and John Phillips found that the young man simply didn\'t have the resources to effectively produce and promote this type of event, they stepped in to help and eventually bought the young man out.  1967  Look Closely, This photo shows the spot where Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Hendrix supposedly scratched this himself the night of his performance. It is from this exact same stage where the Monterey Summer of Love Festival - 45 Years Later will take place!  An aerial view of the packed arena at The Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday June 17th, 1967. Its amazing that this little arena still looks almost exactly like it did 45 years ago.  The \'67 festival started on a Friday evening and ended late on Sunday night. In between, Music History was made.  Sunday, June 18  With two huge singles behind them, the Airplane was one of the  major attractions of the festival.  The Who  Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of "My Generation", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction". The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died 6 months later in a plane crash at the age of 26.

Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before.

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission.

Khrushchev dramatically banging his shoe in anger at a 1960 United Nations session...the problem is, for many years, this "common knowledge" has been placed in doubt. There is no photo or other definitive evidence that proves this dramatic moment ever occurred. Image above shows the former Russian leader with a pair of his actual shoes.  Assumptions about common knowledge can be very dangerous. As\xa0the saying goes,\xa0a journalist even needs to check “if\xa0his mother loves him.” It means that reporters need to\xa0test\xa0everything – even\xa0common knowledge- \xa0before presenting it as fact.  Case in point: After an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at the head of former President George W. Bush during a December 2008 press conference, many\xa0media outlets\xa0cited an earlier political incident involving shoes.\xa0From\xa0 the lede of an\xa0L.A. Times article : “Shoes make news surprisingly often. Think Soviet Premier Nikita\xa0Khrushchev\xa0at the U.N. General Assembly in 1960, brandishing his shoe at a Filipino delegate who was accusing the U.S.S.R. of imperialism in Eastern Europe.” A Times (London) article says , “October 1960 Nikita Khrushchev, the Russian leader, bangs his shoe on a table at the UN after being accused of imperialism.” Which was it – did he “brandish” his shoe? or did he “bang” it on the table?  The details surrounding the incident are not clear. Johnny Phillips of the News Herald says different news outlets, assigned “three completely different dates and historical circumstances.” Phillips\xa0cites “eye-witness” accounts of the event that vary greatly. Some say he never removed his shoe, others say he threw it, others still say he banged it on the desk.  In 2000, Khrushchev’s granddaughter – fed up with being asked repeatedly about the incident – decided to set the record straight . “It has been 40 years,” she said, “Why are the versions so different? And there are no pictures! What if it had never happened?”  You May Also Like...  BBC won\'t show accused child sex abuser Jimmy Savile on air to protect victims  After the Bush shoe incident, the Toronto Star tried–but failed – to avoid making an error. They still made a factual error by only briefly referencing the Khrushchev antics: “Nikita Khrushchev famously banged his shoe on the desk of the United Nations.” But whether or not the shoe was banged on the table is a disputed fact.  The only verifiable fact is that Khrushchev did something involving a shoe in 1960. Since the whole truth is unknown, reporters need to use qualifying language to clarify that when referencing the event. Using qualifying or distancing language should be the regular practice whenever reporters reference a “common knowledge” event of which the truth is not completely known.  In addition to the way the event should be qualified in the future, news outlets need to go back through their records and correct any previous references to the incident. Phillips is not wrong to suggest this, as the New York Times set the precedent by correcting 12 years worth of stories that erroneously called Senator McCain a “fighter pilot.” Every story from the 12 year period was corrected.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

He would have finished eighth but there was a disqualification. Kirk Stackle won the race.  Tom Jager, world record-holder and two-time world champion in the 50-meter freestyle qualified for his first national meet in the 1,650y free.  In 1964 there were only two 14-year-olds competing in the Olympic Trials--Mark Spitz, who went on to win seven gold medals at the 1972 Olympics and Dennis Pursley, who went on to become the USS National Team Director.  Americans Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer registered the first official tie in Olympic history in the 100-meter freestyle at the 1984 Olympics. They each recorded a time of 55.92.  Only track and field has more U.S. Olympic medals to its credit than men\'s or women\'s swimming.  The U.S. has hosted the most Olympics since the first modern Olympiad in 1896. (1904 in St. Louis; 1932 & 1984 in Los Angeles; 1996 in Atlanta.)  The Japanese won all the men\'s tides except the 400-meter freestyle in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. (Buster Crabbe won the 400-meter free)  In the 1948 Olympics, the U.S. won every event in the swimming competition.  Jill Sterkel is the only woman to make four U.S. Olympic swim teams--1976, 1980, 1984, 1988.  Tracy Caulkins is the only swimmer ever, man or woman, to own American records in every stroke.  In the 1984 Olympics, there were no women\'s World Records set.  Leigh Ann Fetter was the first woman to break 22 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle with a 21.92 at the 1990 NCAA Championships.  Of current world record holders, Mary T Meagher has held a world record the longest. She first set the record in the 200-meter butterfly in 1979 and has broken it an additional four times to the current standard of 2:05.96. She also owns the 10 of the 12 fastest times in history in the event.  Since the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896, U.S. men have earned 207 medals, including 90 golds. Since women\'s swimming was added to the Olympic program in 1920, the U.S. representatives have won 140 medals, including 63 gold.  At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, the U.S. men\'s 400 meter medley relay consisted of all four 100-meter stroke world record holders, the only time this has happened in swimming history. (Rick Carey, Steve Lundquist, Matt Gribble, Rowdy Gaines)  In the 1904 Olympic Games, the first three places in the plunge-for-distance event went to members of the New York Athletic Club. The gold went to William Dickey with a plunge of 62�6�.  Gold medalist hopeful Felix Farrell swam in the 1960 U.S. Olympic Time Trials only six days after an appendectomy. Not fully recovered, he placed fourth in the 100-meter free. This finish was good enough to put him on the 800-meter and 400-meter freestyle relays in which he recovered sufficiently to anchor the U.S. teams to World Records in both events.  At the 1972 Olympic Games, Steve Genter suffered a collapsed lung only days before his event. Swimming without the consent of his doctors he went on to finish with a silver in the 200-meter freestyle and a bronze in the 400-meter freestyle.  Buster Crabbe, gold and bronze medalist in the 1910 Olympics, went on after his swimming career to appear in 175 movies. He signed with Paramount for his first film "King of The Jungle" in hopes of becoming a rival to Johnny Weissmuller in the movie industry. Weissmuller was a swimming Olympian who starred in 12 Tarzan pictures.  The first recorded swimming competition in the United States took place in 1883 with the New York Athletic Club, who held annual   competitions through 1887 when the Amateur Athletic Union began sponsoring the events.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Unlike the other islands in French Polynesia, there are no lagoons or protected coral reefs surrounding these landscapes. Instead, steep volcanic mountains plunge straight into the pounding Pacific Ocean, while jagged ridges lay interspersed between deep valleys and thriving jungles.  ARCHIPELAGO:  Melville\'s Mysterious Marquesas Then And NowMelville\'s Mysterious Marquesas Then And Now | The Huffington Post  Melville\'s Mysterious Marquesas Then And Now  07/02/2012 07:24 am ET | Updated Sep 01, 2012  Lorie Karnath 37th President, The Explorers Club  Despite being one of the most remote archipelagoes on the planet, the rugged Marquesas Islands have attracted more than their fair share of luminaries. The far-flung Marquesas are comprised of a group of 14 islands in the southern Pacific Ocean, part of French Polynesia. Located at 9° 00S, 139° 30W, the islands lie just under 1400 km northeast of Tahiti and approximately 4800 km from Mexico\'s west coast, the closest continental land mass.  The islands\' native name "Henua Enata" means "The Land of Men", and these are distributed between a northern grouping Eïao, Hatutu (Hatutaa), Motu One, together with the islands centered around the large island of Nuku Hiva and a southern one clustered around the main island of Hiva `Oa . With a combined land mass of about 1049 km squared, all are of volcanic origin except for Motu One.  Over the centuries the Marquesas\' allure has proven particularly compelling to adventurers, artists, musicians and writers.  In 1841 Herman Melville sailed from Massachusetts aboard the whaler Acushnet, on an 18 month journey which later served as the template for his classic whaling tale Moby-Dick. Upon reaching the Marquesas, Melville\'s first perusal of the island\'s striking coastline, dramatically punctuated by spectacular spiraling peaks that appeared to vanish amongst the clouds, enthralled him. Once ashore, the islands copious vegetation, including a plethora of tropical fruits, cascading waterfalls, perpendicular cliffs and tumultuous streams further inspired the writer. So much so, in fact, that he abruptly abandoned ship. Having done this Melville voluntarily took up residence amongst the Typee natives, who were, at the time, considered to have a proclivity towards cannibalism. The sojourn inspired the author\'s book named after these indigenous people, which captured the public\'s imagination and served for many as an initial personification of primitive cultures.  Other authors, including Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London, would also fall under the islands\' captivating spell. The post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, a key figure in the development of modern art, spent his latter years furthering his mastery of flat congruent color planes influenced by the tropical palette that he discovered on the Marquesas. The Belgian singer Jacques Brel also spent time there and was later buried on the main island of Hiva Oa, not far from Gauguin\'s final resting place.  The population of the isolated islands is approximated hovers around 9000 although it is estimated that it was once more than ten times this number. The drastic reduction was triggered by diseases carried by the early western explorers, further aggravated by subsequent slave trade, cultural genocide and war. Documentation indicates that the islands were first settled by the Polynesians most likely from Samoa and Tonga, these are supposed to have reached the region sometime before 100 AD. A visit to the Marquesas today reveals a land full of enchantments and much unchanged from earlier times. The Marquesan people have stayed true to their distinctive history cultures and customs. These friendly and hospitable people embrace the future with an eye towards accommodating the spirits of their ancient past.  A few roads have been built or are under construction and some of the main villages even boast a handful of street lamps, however the majority of the islands\' topography remains untamed. The best way to discover the many secluded beaches is via sailboat. To access much of the mountainous regions and luxuriantly vegetated valleys, or best penetrate the islands\' thick forests, often requires a journey by foot or horseback.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

From my research, I believe a young  music enthusiast from the Monterey area, who had attended the Monterey Jazz  Festival thought it would be great to present a Pop music festival similar to the  Jazz festival. As he started his quest, one of the first acts he contacted was the Mama\'s & the Papa\'s.  When Lou Adler and John Phillips found that the young man simply didn\'t have the resources to effectively produce and promote this type of event, they stepped in to help and eventually bought the young man out.  1967  Look Closely, This photo shows the spot where Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Hendrix supposedly scratched this himself the night of his performance. It is from this exact same stage where the Monterey Summer of Love Festival - 45 Years Later will take place!  An aerial view of the packed arena at The Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday June 17th, 1967. Its amazing that this little arena still looks almost exactly like it did 45 years ago.  The \'67 festival started on a Friday evening and ended late on Sunday night. In between, Music History was made.  Sunday, June 18  With two huge singles behind them, the Airplane was one of the  major attractions of the festival.  The Who  Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of "My Generation", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction". The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died 6 months later in a plane crash at the age of 26.  Ravi Shankar  Ravi Shankar was another artist who was introduced to America at the Monterey festival. The Raga Dhun (Dadra and Fast Teental) (which was later miscredited as "Raga Bhimpalasi") an excerpt from Shankar\'s four-hour performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, concluded the Monterey Pop film, introducing the artist to a new generation of music fans.

Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.

He would have finished eighth but there was a disqualification. Kirk Stackle won the race.  Tom Jager, world record-holder and two-time world champion in the 50-meter freestyle qualified for his first national meet in the 1,650y free.  In 1964 there were only two 14-year-olds competing in the Olympic Trials--Mark Spitz, who went on to win seven gold medals at the 1972 Olympics and Dennis Pursley, who went on to become the USS National Team Director.  Americans Nancy Hogshead and Carrie Steinseifer registered the first official tie in Olympic history in the 100-meter freestyle at the 1984 Olympics. They each recorded a time of 55.92.  Only track and field has more U.S. Olympic medals to its credit than men\'s or women\'s swimming.  The U.S. has hosted the most Olympics since the first modern Olympiad in 1896. (1904 in St. Louis; 1932 & 1984 in Los Angeles; 1996 in Atlanta.)  The Japanese won all the men\'s tides except the 400-meter freestyle in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. (Buster Crabbe won the 400-meter free)  In the 1948 Olympics, the U.S. won every event in the swimming competition.  Jill Sterkel is the only woman to make four U.S. Olympic swim teams--1976, 1980, 1984, 1988.  Tracy Caulkins is the only swimmer ever, man or woman, to own American records in every stroke.  In the 1984 Olympics, there were no women\'s World Records set.  Leigh Ann Fetter was the first woman to break 22 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle with a 21.92 at the 1990 NCAA Championships.  Of current world record holders, Mary T Meagher has held a world record the longest. She first set the record in the 200-meter butterfly in 1979 and has broken it an additional four times to the current standard of 2:05.96. She also owns the 10 of the 12 fastest times in history in the event.  Since the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896, U.S. men have earned 207 medals, including 90 golds. Since women\'s swimming was added to the Olympic program in 1920, the U.S. representatives have won 140 medals, including 63 gold.  At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, the U.S. men\'s 400 meter medley relay consisted of all four 100-meter stroke world record holders, the only time this has happened in swimming history. (Rick Carey, Steve Lundquist, Matt Gribble, Rowdy Gaines)  In the 1904 Olympic Games, the first three places in the plunge-for-distance event went to members of the New York Athletic Club. The gold went to William Dickey with a plunge of 62�6�.  Gold medalist hopeful Felix Farrell swam in the 1960 U.S. Olympic Time Trials only six days after an appendectomy. Not fully recovered, he placed fourth in the 100-meter free. This finish was good enough to put him on the 800-meter and 400-meter freestyle relays in which he recovered sufficiently to anchor the U.S. teams to World Records in both events.  At the 1972 Olympic Games, Steve Genter suffered a collapsed lung only days before his event. Swimming without the consent of his doctors he went on to finish with a silver in the 200-meter freestyle and a bronze in the 400-meter freestyle.  Buster Crabbe, gold and bronze medalist in the 1910 Olympics, went on after his swimming career to appear in 175 movies. He signed with Paramount for his first film "King of The Jungle" in hopes of becoming a rival to Johnny Weissmuller in the movie industry. Weissmuller was a swimming Olympian who starred in 12 Tarzan pictures.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Unlike the other islands in French Polynesia, there are no lagoons or protected coral reefs surrounding these landscapes. Instead, steep volcanic mountains plunge straight into the pounding Pacific Ocean, while jagged ridges lay interspersed between deep valleys and thriving jungles.  ARCHIPELAGO:  Melville\'s Mysterious Marquesas Then And NowMelville\'s Mysterious Marquesas Then And Now | The Huffington Post  Melville\'s Mysterious Marquesas Then And Now  07/02/2012 07:24 am ET | Updated Sep 01, 2012  Lorie Karnath 37th President, The Explorers Club  Despite being one of the most remote archipelagoes on the planet, the rugged Marquesas Islands have attracted more than their fair share of luminaries. The far-flung Marquesas are comprised of a group of 14 islands in the southern Pacific Ocean, part of French Polynesia. Located at 9° 00S, 139° 30W, the islands lie just under 1400 km northeast of Tahiti and approximately 4800 km from Mexico\'s west coast, the closest continental land mass.  The islands\' native name "Henua Enata" means "The Land of Men", and these are distributed between a northern grouping Eïao, Hatutu (Hatutaa), Motu One, together with the islands centered around the large island of Nuku Hiva and a southern one clustered around the main island of Hiva `Oa . With a combined land mass of about 1049 km squared, all are of volcanic origin except for Motu One.  Over the centuries the Marquesas\' allure has proven particularly compelling to adventurers, artists, musicians and writers.  In 1841 Herman Melville sailed from Massachusetts aboard the whaler Acushnet, on an 18 month journey which later served as the template for his classic whaling tale Moby-Dick. Upon reaching the Marquesas, Melville\'s first perusal of the island\'s striking coastline, dramatically punctuated by spectacular spiraling peaks that appeared to vanish amongst the clouds, enthralled him. Once ashore, the islands copious vegetation, including a plethora of tropical fruits, cascading waterfalls, perpendicular cliffs and tumultuous streams further inspired the writer. So much so, in fact, that he abruptly abandoned ship. Having done this Melville voluntarily took up residence amongst the Typee natives, who were, at the time, considered to have a proclivity towards cannibalism. The sojourn inspired the author\'s book named after these indigenous people, which captured the public\'s imagination and served for many as an initial personification of primitive cultures.  Other authors, including Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London, would also fall under the islands\' captivating spell. The post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, a key figure in the development of modern art, spent his latter years furthering his mastery of flat congruent color planes influenced by the tropical palette that he discovered on the Marquesas. The Belgian singer Jacques Brel also spent time there and was later buried on the main island of Hiva Oa, not far from Gauguin\'s final resting place.  The population of the isolated islands is approximated hovers around 9000 although it is estimated that it was once more than ten times this number. The drastic reduction was triggered by diseases carried by the early western explorers, further aggravated by subsequent slave trade, cultural genocide and war. Documentation indicates that the islands were first settled by the Polynesians most likely from Samoa and Tonga, these are supposed to have reached the region sometime before 100 AD. A visit to the Marquesas today reveals a land full of enchantments and much unchanged from earlier times. The Marquesan people have stayed true to their distinctive history cultures and customs. These friendly and hospitable people embrace the future with an eye towards accommodating the spirits of their ancient past.  A few roads have been built or are under construction and some of the main villages even boast a handful of street lamps, however the majority of the islands\' topography remains untamed. The best way to discover the many secluded beaches is via sailboat. To access much of the mountainous regions and luxuriantly vegetated valleys, or best penetrate the islands\' thick forests, often requires a journey by foot or horseback.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards. A giant picture of Francis stooping to head the ball remains on display in the main entrance and reception area of Forest's City Ground stadium | Question: Which manager bought Trevor Francis thereby turning him into the first million pound footballer ?", ['brian clough'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7153'), ("Context: The series -- presented as if it were a real documentary -- depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company .

From my research, I believe a young  music enthusiast from the Monterey area, who had attended the Monterey Jazz  Festival thought it would be great to present a Pop music festival similar to the  Jazz festival. As he started his quest, one of the first acts he contacted was the Mama\'s & the Papa\'s.  When Lou Adler and John Phillips found that the young man simply didn\'t have the resources to effectively produce and promote this type of event, they stepped in to help and eventually bought the young man out.  1967  Look Closely, This photo shows the spot where Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Hendrix supposedly scratched this himself the night of his performance. It is from this exact same stage where the Monterey Summer of Love Festival - 45 Years Later will take place!  An aerial view of the packed arena at The Monterey Pop Festival on Saturday June 17th, 1967. Its amazing that this little arena still looks almost exactly like it did 45 years ago.  The \'67 festival started on a Friday evening and ended late on Sunday night. In between, Music History was made.  Sunday, June 18  With two huge singles behind them, the Airplane was one of the  major attractions of the festival.  The Who  Although already a big act in the UK, and now gaining some attention in the US after playing some New York dates two months earlier, The Who were propelled into the American mainstream at Monterey. At the end of their frenetic performance of "My Generation", the audience were stunned as guitarist Pete Townshend began smashing his guitar, amid smoke bombs and frightened concert staff rushing onstage to scurry expensive microphones to safety. At the end of the mayhem, drummer Keith Moon kicked over his drum kit as the band exited the stage. The Who, after winning a coin toss, performed before Jimi Hendrix, as Townshend and Hendrix each refused to go on after the other - both having planned an instrument-demolishing conclusion to their respective sets.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Hendrix ended his Monterey performance with an unpredictable version of "Wild Thing", which he capped by kneeling over his guitar, pouring lighter fluid over it, setting it aflame, and then smashing it in to the stage seven times before throwing its remains into the audience. This produced unforeseen sounds and these actions contributed to his rising popularity in the USA.  Janis Joplin  Monterey Pop was also one of the earliest major public performances for Janis Joplin, who appeared as a member of Big Brother and The Holding Company. Joplin was seen swigging from a bottle of Southern Comfort as she gave a provocative rendition of the song "Ball \'n\' Chain". Columbia Records signed Big Brother and The Holding Company on the basis of their performance at Monterey.  Otis Redding  Redding, backed by Booker T. & The MG\'s, was included on the bill through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler, who saw the festival as an opportunity to advance Redding\'s career. Up until that point, Redding had performed mainly for black audiences, besides a few successful shows at the Whisky a Go Go. Redding\'s show, received well by the audience ("there is certainly more audible crowd participation in Redding\'s set than in any of the others filmed by Pennebaker that weekend") included "Respect" and a version of "Satisfaction". The festival would be one of his last major performances. He died 6 months later in a plane crash at the age of 26.  Ravi Shankar  Ravi Shankar was another artist who was introduced to America at the Monterey festival. The Raga Dhun (Dadra and Fast Teental) (which was later miscredited as "Raga Bhimpalasi") an excerpt from Shankar\'s four-hour performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, concluded the Monterey Pop film, introducing the artist to a new generation of music fans.

Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget . As the film director | Question: In which London magazine did Sherlock Holmes first appear?', ['strand'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4199'), ('Context: Alcoholic beverageAn alcoholic beverage, or alcoholic drink, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of the psychoactive drug ethanol (informally called alcohol), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability, and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor, and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.  Drinking alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures. Most countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption;   some countries with Muslim majorities ban such activities entirely. However, alcoholic beverages are legal in most parts of the world. The global alcoholic beverages industry exceeded $1 trillion in 2014.   Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world. In the United States 89% of adults have drunk alcohol at some point in time, 70% have drunk it in the last year and 56% in the last month.  Alcoholic beverages are typically divided into three classes—beers, wines, and spirits—and typically contain between 3% and 40% alcohol by volume.  Discovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented beverages existed at least as early as the Neolithic period (cir. 10,000 BC).  Many nonhuman animals also consume alcohol when given the opportunity and are affected in much the same way as humans, although humans are the only species known to produce alcoholic beverages intentionally.   Fermented beverages  Wine  Wine is a fermented beverage produced from grapes. Wine involves a longer fermentation process than beer and also a long aging process (months or years), resulting in an alcohol content of 9%–16% ABV.  Sparkling wine can be made by means of a secondary fermentation.  Fruit wines  are made from fruits other than grapes, such as plums, cherries, or apples.  Rice wines like sake are made from rice.  Beer  Beer is a beverage fermented from grain mash. It is made from barley or a blend of several grains. If the fermented mash is distilled, then the beverage is a spirit. Beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world.   Cider  Cider or cyder ( ) is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from any fruit juice; apple juice (traditional and most common), peaches, pears ("Perry" cider) or other fruit. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% ABV to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, cider may be called "apple wine".   Mead  Mead is an alcoholic beverage created by fermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic content of mead may range from about 8% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage\'s fermentable sugar is derived from honey.  Distilled beverages  A distilled beverage or liquor is an alcoholic beverage produced by distilling (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced by means of fermenting grain, fruit, or vegetables.  Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic beverages that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits.  For the most common distilled beverages, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, tequila, whiskey, brandy, and soju are examples of distilled beverages. Distilling concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in applejack.  Fortified wine is wine, such as port or sherry, to which a distilled beverage (usually brandy) has been added. Fortified wine is distinguished from spirits made from wine in that spirits are produced by means of distillation, while fortified wine is simply wine that has had a spirit added to it. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth. | Question: What alcoholic drink whose name means \'little water\' was first distilled from grain in the 8-9th centuries in NE Europe?', ['vodka'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2276'), ("Context: Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz ( sometimes called `` Doof '' ) is a fictional character from the American animated television show Phineas and Ferb .

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.

Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.  Blomkvist breaks into Martin\'s house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread.

Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.  Drinking alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures. Most countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption;   some countries with Muslim majorities ban such activities entirely. However, alcoholic beverages are legal in most parts of the world. The global alcoholic beverages industry exceeded $1 trillion in 2014.   Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world. In the United States 89% of adults have drunk alcohol at some point in time, 70% have drunk it in the last year and 56% in the last month.  Alcoholic beverages are typically divided into three classes—beers, wines, and spirits—and typically contain between 3% and 40% alcohol by volume.  Discovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented beverages existed at least as early as the Neolithic period (cir. 10,000 BC).  Many nonhuman animals also consume alcohol when given the opportunity and are affected in much the same way as humans, although humans are the only species known to produce alcoholic beverages intentionally.   Fermented beverages  Wine  Wine is a fermented beverage produced from grapes. Wine involves a longer fermentation process than beer and also a long aging process (months or years), resulting in an alcohol content of 9%–16% ABV.  Sparkling wine can be made by means of a secondary fermentation.  Fruit wines  are made from fruits other than grapes, such as plums, cherries, or apples.  Rice wines like sake are made from rice.  Beer  Beer is a beverage fermented from grain mash. It is made from barley or a blend of several grains. If the fermented mash is distilled, then the beverage is a spirit. Beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world.   Cider  Cider or cyder ( ) is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from any fruit juice; apple juice (traditional and most common), peaches, pears ("Perry" cider) or other fruit. Cider alcohol content varies from 1.2% ABV to 8.5% or more in traditional English ciders. In some regions, cider may be called "apple wine".   Mead  Mead is an alcoholic beverage created by fermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. The alcoholic content of mead may range from about 8% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage\'s fermentable sugar is derived from honey.  Distilled beverages  A distilled beverage or liquor is an alcoholic beverage produced by distilling (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced by means of fermenting grain, fruit, or vegetables.  Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic beverages that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits.  For the most common distilled beverages, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, tequila, whiskey, brandy, and soju are examples of distilled beverages. Distilling concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in applejack.  Fortified wine is wine, such as port or sherry, to which a distilled beverage (usually brandy) has been added. Fortified wine is distinguished from spirits made from wine in that spirits are produced by means of distillation, while fortified wine is simply wine that has had a spirit added to it. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth. | Question: What alcoholic drink whose name means \'little water\' was first distilled from grain in the 8-9th centuries in NE Europe?', ['vodka'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2276'), ("Context: Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz ( sometimes called `` Doof '' ) is a fictional character from the American animated television show Phineas and Ferb .

The National Board of Review threw everything for a loop by naming a documentary, The True Glory, as their Best Picture, but The Lost Weekend came in second and won Best Actor.\xa0 The New York Film Critics were more impressed, giving it Best Picture, Director and Actor.\xa0 The Golden Globes concurred, naming it as the winner of the same three awards.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.

Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941.

Overview  The skull is a bony structure found in many animals which serves as the general framework for the head . The skull supports the structures of the face and protects the head against injury.  The skull can be subdivided into two parts:  the cranium and the mandible. A skull that is missing a mandible is only a cranium; this is the source of a very commonly made error in terminology. Those animals having skulls are called craniates.  Protection of the brain is only one part of the function of a bony skull. For example, a fixed distance between the eyes is essential for stereoscopic vision , and a fixed position for the ears helps the brain to use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.  Human skulls  Human skull (front)  Human skull (side)  In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones . Except for the mandible , all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures , rigid articulations permitting very little movement.  Eight bones form the neurocranium (braincase), a protective vault surrounding the brain . Fourteen bones form the splanchnocranium, the bones supporting the face. Encased within the temporal bones are the six ear ossicles of the middle ears , though these are not part of the skull. The hyoid bone , supporting the tongue , is usually not considered as part of the skull either, as it does not articulate with any other bones.  The skull contains the sinus cavities , which are air-filled cavities lined with respiratory epithelium , which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are unclear; they may contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength,or they may be important in improving the resonance of the voice. In some animals, such as the elephant, the sinuses are extensive. The elephant skull needs to be very large, to form an attachment for muscles of the neck and trunk, but is also unexpectedly light; the comparatively small brain-case is surrounded by large sinuses which reduce the weight. The meninges are the three layers, or membranes, which surround the structures of the nervous system . They are known as the dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . Other than being classified together, they have little in common with each other.  In humans, the anatomical position for the skull is the Frankfurt plane , where the lower margins of the orbits and the upper borders of the ear canals are all in a horizontal plane. This is the position where the subject is standing and looking directly forward. For comparison, the skulls of other species, notably primates and hominids, may sometimes be studied in the Frankfurt plane. However, this does not always equate to a natural posture in life.  Possible types of skull fractures  Temporal Fenestra  This Massospondylus skull shows the two temporal fenestrae typical of diapsids .  The temporal fenestra are anatomical features of the amniote skull, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra is critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.  Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but the more advanced sauropsids and synapsids did. As time progressed, sauropsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. | Question: In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones, which are joined together by sutures, rigid articulations permitting very little movement, except for which one?", ['jaw'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2850'), ('Context: The Man from Jupiter  "The Man from Jupiter" is the fourth episode of the third season of the American animated television series "Archer".

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa.

He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation\'s financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and "The New York Post" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.

"Captain Horatio Hornblower" actually covers the key events in Forester\'s first trio of Hornblower adventures, "Beat to Quarters," "Ship of the Line" and Flying Colours." Hornblower (American Gregory Peck playing the quintessential English hero) is sent on a secret mission to the far side of South America where he has to capture a Spanish frigate not once but twice, all because of the problematic delay in having new orders catch up with him in the time of wooden sailing ships.  Chance throws Hornblower together with Lady Barbara Wellesley (Virginia Mayo), the sister of the Duke of Wellington.  She is engaged to some admiral and he is already married, but there is no doubt that they are meant for each other.  Besides, even Fate has to take a backseat to Hornblower\'s sense of duty.  Even when he is captured by the French it is but another opportunity for grand adventure.  Like many fans I came to the Hornblower novels and this rousing 1951 film directed by Raoul Walsh.  The happy ending falls into place a bit too neatly, but that is what happened in the original novels and not simply a Hollywood decision.  The sea battles with the fully rigged ships are as fine as you can find from the good old days of movie-making, but my favorite scene is the touching one when the Captain and Lady Barbara deal with the final moment\'s of the youngest member of the ship\'s company. "Captain Horatio Hornblower," like the novels, achieves that feeling that we are truly in the middle of an epic tale, with well-established characters who we readily believe have already had long and glorious histories.  I think Lt. Bush (Robert Beatty) gets a lot of the credit for that as the unofficial "narrator" of the tale.  So, if you have loved the imported A&E adventures of the young Horatio Hornblower, you certainly need to get around to watching the original film version and reading Forester\'s novels.  If not, you will just be a scurvy dog, matie.  One person found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsNice piece of maritime moviemaking  ByDave P.on August 25, 2014  I enjoy the C.S. Forester books. It amazing me the battle scene scopes in this film considering it was created in 1951. The leads don\'t speak with authentic accents, common for this time of filmmaking in Hollywood, but is distracting in this day and age. But still it is definitely a should see if you are a Horatio Hornblower fan.  Format: VHS Tape | Verified Purchase  This is a 1951 big-budget film adaptation of three of C.S. Forester\'s Horatio Hornblower novels.  Specifically, this movie combines "Beat to Quarters," "Ship of the Line," and "Flying Colors." It necessarily condenses the latter two novels, but does a good job in doing so.  These are great novels, and this is a great film.  Gregory Peck does a stellar job as Captain Hornblower, and Barbara Mayo puts in a fine performance as Lady Barbara.  At the time there were some complaints that both leads were Americans, but the film justified the casting choices both in the eyes of the critics and at the box office.  For those unfamiliar with the Hornblower series of novels, these stories are widely considered to be the greatest novels ever written dealing with the British navy during the Napoleonic wars.

Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head.  THE answer is simple. The ancient historians such as Suetonius and Plutarch were as much in the entertainment business as the great playwright. Phrases like Suetonius\'s \'Kai su, teknon\' and Plutarch\'s dramatic descriptions, were as much for the enjoyment of the reader/listener as for the true recording of fact. Shakespeare simply used the line \'Et tu Brute\' because it suited his dramatic purpose, just as Plutarch and Suetonius had used what suited them. Personally, I suspect Julius Caesar\'s last words were \'aaaaaaaaaaah\'.  Jonathan Munn, Whitchurch, Cardiff.  I THINK it\'s generally accepted that Caesar\'s dying words were the Greek \'Kai su, teknon\'. Romans of his class moved easily between Latin and Greek. But it\'s important to recognise that he was not asking \'You too, my son?\' The words \'Kai su\' - found in Greek comedy and on mosaics - mean \'Screw you!\' and the \'teknon\' (\'kid\') just makes it fiercer.  Greg Rowe, The Queen\'s College, Oxford.  I MUST point out that Shakespeare does not make Caesar\'s last words \'Et tu, Brute?\' Shakespeare gives him another three words after the famous quotation: \'Then fall Caesar!\'  Eric Standidge, London SE10.  As we all know, the old Greek language doesn\'t have anything to do with a modern Greek language and no Greeks can understand the old one. The only people who do understand it are Albanians. The etymology of the word KAI SU TEKNON (Kai s\'u te knon)means Cry like you are singing. Kai -Cray SU- like you Te`knon- singing Shakespeare was in Albania a few times and he maybe understood the Albanian language.  Lamun Dardanian, Kosova Albania  It expresses a meaning that cannot be made in English - using tu implies a closeness, such as brother.  p martin, nuneaton uk  Kai su, teknon means "Even you, son!"

Contents  Biography  Thuringia  Buschmann was born in Friedrichroda, Thuringia. His father, Johann Buschmann, was a pipe organ builder, who in 1816 developed the terpodion , a friction instrument played either with wooden hammers or sometimes with a piano-like keyboard, based on the same principle as the glass harmonica . From 1819 Johann took Friedrich with him on his frequent journeys.  Berlin  In the first half of 1821 Johann Buschmann travelled to London, accompanied by his son Friedrich, and agreed a £1,000 contract with a Mr. Löschmann besides taking other orders for terpodions. On their return the Buschmanns set up a workshop in Berlin, where Friedrich, aged 16, was already skilled and experienced enough at musical instrument construction to begin building terpodions on the basis of written instructions from his father.  Altogether, 25 terpodions were built, most of them by Friedrich. His brother Eduard worked mainly on the wooden cases and inlays, and was in charge of the appearance of the instruments, though the brothers lived and worked in different German cities. Nearly all the terpodions ever built are still in existence in different European museums.  Johann and Eduard meanwhile continued their advertising journeys throughout Europe. Besides their performances, they had to service the instruments they had already sold, as they did not function very reliably over a longer period. This may well have been a principal reason why Friedrich was looking for other methods of reliable sound generation for tuning purposes. It is certain that they must have become aware of all kinds of modern developments in this area as they travelled through different countries, which contributed to Friedrich\'s further refinement of the physharmonica .  In Berlin in 1828 Friedrich built an instrument, originally intended only for use as a tuning aid, which at first consisted of 21 different metal free reeds fastened to a wooden block in such a way that it was possible to blow the reeds individually. He then experimented further by fastening the reeds inside a small box "4 inches square and equally high"  Letter to his uncle dated 28 December 1828  (in other words a cubic box with 4" sides), each of which could be made to vibrate by blowing through 21 individual "tone chambers" (Tonlochkanzellen). This instrument he named an aeoline .  The earliest experiments with the aeoline may have taken place in 1824, when it has been claimed that Buschmann built a tuning aid named an aura, about 4 inches long and equipped with 15 reed tongues. (The name Aura was also then in use in German to mean a Jew\'s harp ).  In Buschmann\'s letters to his uncle, brother, and father it appears that he built a bigger version of an aeoline in 1829, with bellows and piano keyboard, which, being about the size of a small writing desk, was still much smaller than any comparable fixed key instrument they had built previously.  The Buschmanns certainly knew of an instrument built at about this time by Johann Caspar Schlimbach , an instrument maker trained in Vienna, and his cousin Bernhard Eschenbach in Königshofen in Bavaria: this was a pianoforte with an aeoline register. Schlimbach made no attempt to protect his invention, but freely showed the instrument to everyone who wanted to see it, with the inevitable result that a number of people patented very similar instruments in Vienna. Indeed, Buschmann\'s father Johann wrote in a letter of 30 October 1829 that he was thinking of taking out a patent for the new instrument in Bavaria.  Hamburg  In 1833 Buschmann married and moved to Hamburg, where he opened a new workshop of his own. There he made mostly physharmonicas , bellows-operated wind instruments, each of which also had a large manual keyboard. For a physharmonica with built-in terpodion he won the great gold medal at the Hamburg Arts and Trades Exhibition of 1838. He died in Hamburg in 1864. | Question: Which musical instrument was patented in Berlin by Freidrich Buschmann in 1822 ?', ['accordions', 'accordion', 'akkordeon'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7160'), ('Context: Juan García Ábrego  Juan García Ábrego (born September 13, 1944) is a former Mexican drug lord who started out his criminal career under the tutelage of his uncle Juan Nepomuceno Guerra, who is reported to be the former head of a criminal dynasty along the U.S.-Mexico border now called the Gulf Cartel.

He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside.

Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C.

Overview  The skull is a bony structure found in many animals which serves as the general framework for the head . The skull supports the structures of the face and protects the head against injury.  The skull can be subdivided into two parts:  the cranium and the mandible. A skull that is missing a mandible is only a cranium; this is the source of a very commonly made error in terminology. Those animals having skulls are called craniates.  Protection of the brain is only one part of the function of a bony skull. For example, a fixed distance between the eyes is essential for stereoscopic vision , and a fixed position for the ears helps the brain to use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.  Human skulls  Human skull (front)  Human skull (side)  In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones . Except for the mandible , all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures , rigid articulations permitting very little movement.  Eight bones form the neurocranium (braincase), a protective vault surrounding the brain . Fourteen bones form the splanchnocranium, the bones supporting the face. Encased within the temporal bones are the six ear ossicles of the middle ears , though these are not part of the skull. The hyoid bone , supporting the tongue , is usually not considered as part of the skull either, as it does not articulate with any other bones.  The skull contains the sinus cavities , which are air-filled cavities lined with respiratory epithelium , which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are unclear; they may contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength,or they may be important in improving the resonance of the voice. In some animals, such as the elephant, the sinuses are extensive. The elephant skull needs to be very large, to form an attachment for muscles of the neck and trunk, but is also unexpectedly light; the comparatively small brain-case is surrounded by large sinuses which reduce the weight. The meninges are the three layers, or membranes, which surround the structures of the nervous system . They are known as the dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . Other than being classified together, they have little in common with each other.  In humans, the anatomical position for the skull is the Frankfurt plane , where the lower margins of the orbits and the upper borders of the ear canals are all in a horizontal plane. This is the position where the subject is standing and looking directly forward. For comparison, the skulls of other species, notably primates and hominids, may sometimes be studied in the Frankfurt plane. However, this does not always equate to a natural posture in life.  Possible types of skull fractures  Temporal Fenestra  This Massospondylus skull shows the two temporal fenestrae typical of diapsids .  The temporal fenestra are anatomical features of the amniote skull, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra is critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.  Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but the more advanced sauropsids and synapsids did. As time progressed, sauropsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. | Question: In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones, which are joined together by sutures, rigid articulations permitting very little movement, except for which one?", ['jaw'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2850'), ('Context: The Man from Jupiter  "The Man from Jupiter" is the fourth episode of the third season of the American animated television series "Archer".

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa.

S. Forester certainly began the saga of his Napoleonic-Era naval hero Horatio Hornblower "in media res." Here is Hornblower as a dashing captain, with the stories of his younger days and later glories both yet to be penned. "Captain Horatio Hornblower" actually covers the key events in Forester\'s first trio of Hornblower adventures, "Beat to Quarters," "Ship of the Line" and Flying Colours." Hornblower (American Gregory Peck playing the quintessential English hero) is sent on a secret mission to the far side of South America where he has to capture a Spanish frigate not once but twice, all because of the problematic delay in having new orders catch up with him in the time of wooden sailing ships.  Chance throws Hornblower together with Lady Barbara Wellesley (Virginia Mayo), the sister of the Duke of Wellington.  She is engaged to some admiral and he is already married, but there is no doubt that they are meant for each other.  Besides, even Fate has to take a backseat to Hornblower\'s sense of duty.  Even when he is captured by the French it is but another opportunity for grand adventure.  Like many fans I came to the Hornblower novels and this rousing 1951 film directed by Raoul Walsh.  The happy ending falls into place a bit too neatly, but that is what happened in the original novels and not simply a Hollywood decision.  The sea battles with the fully rigged ships are as fine as you can find from the good old days of movie-making, but my favorite scene is the touching one when the Captain and Lady Barbara deal with the final moment\'s of the youngest member of the ship\'s company. "Captain Horatio Hornblower," like the novels, achieves that feeling that we are truly in the middle of an epic tale, with well-established characters who we readily believe have already had long and glorious histories.  I think Lt. Bush (Robert Beatty) gets a lot of the credit for that as the unofficial "narrator" of the tale.  So, if you have loved the imported A&E adventures of the young Horatio Hornblower, you certainly need to get around to watching the original film version and reading Forester\'s novels.  If not, you will just be a scurvy dog, matie.  One person found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsNice piece of maritime moviemaking  ByDave P.on August 25, 2014  I enjoy the C.S. Forester books.

Gregory Peck does a stellar job as Captain Hornblower, and Barbara Mayo puts in a fine performance as Lady Barbara.  At the time there were some complaints that both leads were Americans, but the film justified the casting choices both in the eyes of the critics and at the box office.

Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head. | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk  STAGE AND SCREEN  Why did Shakespeare make Julius Caesar\'s last words the Latin \'Et tu, Brute?\' when Suetonius tells us they were the Greek \'Kai su, teknon?\' (You too, my son?)? Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head.  THE answer is simple. The ancient historians such as Suetonius and Plutarch were as much in the entertainment business as the great playwright. Phrases like Suetonius\'s \'Kai su, teknon\' and Plutarch\'s dramatic descriptions, were as much for the enjoyment of the reader/listener as for the true recording of fact. Shakespeare simply used the line \'Et tu Brute\' because it suited his dramatic purpose, just as Plutarch and Suetonius had used what suited them. Personally, I suspect Julius Caesar\'s last words were \'aaaaaaaaaaah\'.  Jonathan Munn, Whitchurch, Cardiff.  I THINK it\'s generally accepted that Caesar\'s dying words were the Greek \'Kai su, teknon\'. Romans of his class moved easily between Latin and Greek. But it\'s important to recognise that he was not asking \'You too, my son?\' The words \'Kai su\' - found in Greek comedy and on mosaics - mean \'Screw you!\' and the \'teknon\' (\'kid\') just makes it fiercer.  Greg Rowe, The Queen\'s College, Oxford.  I MUST point out that Shakespeare does not make Caesar\'s last words \'Et tu, Brute?\' Shakespeare gives him another three words after the famous quotation: \'Then fall Caesar!\'  Eric Standidge, London SE10.  As we all know, the old Greek language doesn\'t have anything to do with a modern Greek language and no Greeks can understand the old one. The only people who do understand it are Albanians. The etymology of the word KAI SU TEKNON (Kai s\'u te knon)means Cry like you are singing. Kai -Cray SU- like you Te`knon- singing Shakespeare was in Albania a few times and he maybe understood the Albanian language.  Lamun Dardanian, Kosova Albania  It expresses a meaning that cannot be made in English - using tu implies a closeness, such as brother.  p martin, nuneaton uk  Kai su, teknon means "Even you, son!" Shakespeare put in Latin because more of his audience knew Latin than Greek. Putting the phrase in another language corresponds to what Caesar himself said.

Contents  Biography  Thuringia  Buschmann was born in Friedrichroda, Thuringia. His father, Johann Buschmann, was a pipe organ builder, who in 1816 developed the terpodion , a friction instrument played either with wooden hammers or sometimes with a piano-like keyboard, based on the same principle as the glass harmonica . From 1819 Johann took Friedrich with him on his frequent journeys.  Berlin  In the first half of 1821 Johann Buschmann travelled to London, accompanied by his son Friedrich, and agreed a £1,000 contract with a Mr. Löschmann besides taking other orders for terpodions. On their return the Buschmanns set up a workshop in Berlin, where Friedrich, aged 16, was already skilled and experienced enough at musical instrument construction to begin building terpodions on the basis of written instructions from his father.  Altogether, 25 terpodions were built, most of them by Friedrich. His brother Eduard worked mainly on the wooden cases and inlays, and was in charge of the appearance of the instruments, though the brothers lived and worked in different German cities. Nearly all the terpodions ever built are still in existence in different European museums.  Johann and Eduard meanwhile continued their advertising journeys throughout Europe. Besides their performances, they had to service the instruments they had already sold, as they did not function very reliably over a longer period. This may well have been a principal reason why Friedrich was looking for other methods of reliable sound generation for tuning purposes. It is certain that they must have become aware of all kinds of modern developments in this area as they travelled through different countries, which contributed to Friedrich\'s further refinement of the physharmonica .  In Berlin in 1828 Friedrich built an instrument, originally intended only for use as a tuning aid, which at first consisted of 21 different metal free reeds fastened to a wooden block in such a way that it was possible to blow the reeds individually. He then experimented further by fastening the reeds inside a small box "4 inches square and equally high"  Letter to his uncle dated 28 December 1828  (in other words a cubic box with 4" sides), each of which could be made to vibrate by blowing through 21 individual "tone chambers" (Tonlochkanzellen). This instrument he named an aeoline .  The earliest experiments with the aeoline may have taken place in 1824, when it has been claimed that Buschmann built a tuning aid named an aura, about 4 inches long and equipped with 15 reed tongues. (The name Aura was also then in use in German to mean a Jew\'s harp ).  In Buschmann\'s letters to his uncle, brother, and father it appears that he built a bigger version of an aeoline in 1829, with bellows and piano keyboard, which, being about the size of a small writing desk, was still much smaller than any comparable fixed key instrument they had built previously.  The Buschmanns certainly knew of an instrument built at about this time by Johann Caspar Schlimbach , an instrument maker trained in Vienna, and his cousin Bernhard Eschenbach in Königshofen in Bavaria: this was a pianoforte with an aeoline register. Schlimbach made no attempt to protect his invention, but freely showed the instrument to everyone who wanted to see it, with the inevitable result that a number of people patented very similar instruments in Vienna. Indeed, Buschmann\'s father Johann wrote in a letter of 30 October 1829 that he was thinking of taking out a patent for the new instrument in Bavaria.  Hamburg  In 1833 Buschmann married and moved to Hamburg, where he opened a new workshop of his own. There he made mostly physharmonicas , bellows-operated wind instruments, each of which also had a large manual keyboard. For a physharmonica with built-in terpodion he won the great gold medal at the Hamburg Arts and Trades Exhibition of 1838. He died in Hamburg in 1864. | Question: Which musical instrument was patented in Berlin by Freidrich Buschmann in 1822 ?', ['accordions', 'accordion', 'akkordeon'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7160'), ('Context: Juan García Ábrego  Juan García Ábrego (born September 13, 1944) is a former Mexican drug lord who started out his criminal career under the tutelage of his uncle Juan Nepomuceno Guerra, who is reported to be the former head of a criminal dynasty along the U.S.-Mexico border now called the Gulf Cartel.

He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside. 'I didn't want to, I was nervous about seeing it again,' he says self-consciously, fiddling with | Question: Although mostly associated with Manchester in which other part of the UK were the Gibb Brothers born?", ['isle of man'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5573'), ("Context: In 1989 , 1,300 stores were operated by the McCrory company .

Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) .
