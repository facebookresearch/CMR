Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work .
