This leads her to plot the death of Snow White and ultimately on the path to her own demise , which in the film is indirectly caused by the Seven Dwarfs .

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?

After ratification in eleven states , in 1789 its elected officers of government assembled in New York City , replacing the Articles of Confederation government . The original Constitution has been amended twenty - seven times . The meaning of the Constitution is interpreted and extended by judicial review in the federal courts . The original parchment copies are on display at the National Archives Building . | Question: prior to ratification of the constitution the u.s. was governed by ?', ['Articles of Confederation government'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-71615'), ("Context: Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh . When creating the character , screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite . Wasikowska read Carroll 's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role . She also watched Jan Švankmajer 's Alice . She said , `` When we were kids , my mum would pop it in the VCR player . We would be disturbed , and would n't really understand it , but we could n't look away because it was too intriguing . So I had kept that feeling about Alice , a kind of haunting feeling . '' Although facing pressures to conform to society 's expectations , Alice grows into a stronger - willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path ; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls , describing the character as `` stubborn , brave , ( and ) non-girlie '' . Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six - year - old girl .   Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp , The Mad Hatter . Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character . '' The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt ; Depp believes that the character `` was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair , through his fingernails and eyes '' . Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C. Nesbitt character ) reflecting a darker , more dangerous personality . Illusionary dancer David `` Elsewhere '' Bernal doubled for Depp during the `` Futterwacken '' sequence near the end of the film .   Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims , the Red Queen . She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters : the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts . Her first name is a play on the word irascible because she is easily irritated , obstreperous , impatient , and quick to anger . Bonham Carter 's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen . The character hates animals , and chooses to use them as servants and furniture . It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband , the King . The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell , a toddler , stating that , `` The Red Queen is just like a toddler , because she 's got a big head and she 's a tyrant . ''   Anne Hathaway as Mirana of Marmoreal , the White Queen . She was one of few characters that did not require digital manipulation . Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife ; `` Cute but psycho . Things even out .

She really likes the dark side , but she 's so scared of going too far into it that she 's made everything appear very light and happy . But she 's living in that place out of fear that she wo n't be able to control herself . '' Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as `` a punk - rock vegan pacifist '' , with inspiration drawn from Debbie Harry , Greta Garbo , and the artwork of Dan Flavin .

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.

Location of Coney Island on a map.  Coney Island is a city found in New York , The United States Of America . It is located 40.58 latitude and -73.99 longitude and it is situated at elevation 2 meters above sea level.  Coney Island has a population of 60,000 making it the 23rd biggest city in New York. It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.

Visitors get to see quirky pieces of the collection, such as a hand-carved figure of the Steeplechase Man and Boardwalk rolling chair.  The museum is open every Saturday and Sunday between 12 and 5 pm, right through the year, with opening hours sometimes extended during the summer months.

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ("Context: In 1955 , the ANC sent out 50,000 volunteers into townships and the countryside to collect `` freedom demands '' from the people of South Africa .

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ("Context: `` Man of the World '' is a song recorded by Fleetwood Mac in 1969 , and composed by vocalist and lead guitarist Peter Green .

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

This article , Article 231 , later became known as the War Guilt clause . The treaty forced Germany to disarm , make substantial territorial concessions , and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers . In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion marks ( then $31.4 billion or £ 6.6 billion , roughly equivalent to US $442 billion or UK £ 284 billion in 2018 ) . At the time economists , notably John Maynard Keynes ( a British delegate to the Paris Peace Conference ) , predicted that the treaty was too harsh -- a `` Carthaginian peace '' -- and said the reparations figure was excessive and counter-productive , views that , since then , have been the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists from several countries .

Eleven candidates received the electors ' second votes , of which John Adams received the most votes . As the person who received the second largest number of votes overall , he was elected vice president . This procedure was changed by the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution due to issues with Presidential and Vice-Presidential contentions and incompatibility , under which the electors have been able to cast separate ballots for both president and vice president since 1804 . | Question: who was the first president of the united states why was he the choice of all ?", ['George Washington', 'George Washington was enormously popular'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-58673'), ('Context: Annual precipitation is fairly even throughout the year across New York state .

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY     1900  •S     Anthony van Dyck.      aking into consideration the intellectual life of the  Flemish and of the Dutch in general, the painters are  undoubtedly the most gifted of our countrymen. The  taste for Art was most lavishly bestowed upon them,  they have been the creating genius of our race, men with  keener eyes and more subtle feeling and with a hand more cunning  than the majority of their "fellow countrymen. They have been  instrumental in bringing the people of the low-lying countries to the  fore, causing them to rank amongst the highest in the Ideal world.  Now the most poetical of these painters was Anthony van Dyck, that is  to say if one understands by that word « poetical » a certain suscep-  tibility for impressions, and an inclination to be touched by emotions,  as may be termed sorrowful, suffering and tender.   Van Dyck was endowed with more feeling than strength, he  offered apparently but little resistance to the influence of others, yet  his natural disposition and his fine artistic taste were not submerged  by the powerful impression made on him by his illustrious prede-  cessors. These impressions, it may be said, he outgrew rather than  threw off, and drifted unconsciously into an independence which  ripened and matured through the increasing power of his matchless  talent. Born in Antwerp, of the bluest blood, he loved his native town  and with true artistic feeling was carried away and enraptured by  all that may be called beautiful, brilliant and glowing ; he surpassed  all others by the sensibility of his character, by the distinction of his  style, by his power to charm and by his love of the eminent. The  tender graceful sensitiveness of his nature made him a striking contrast  to and a protest against that boorishness and sluggishness, which are  considered by some the characteristics of our nation.   Such van Dyck appears to us as artist when we take a broad and     impartial view of him, but upon a nearer acquaintance his talents  become more sharply defined, especially when viewed by the glimpses  we get of his life and from a closer examination of his work.   So too he appears to us as a man : of noble exterior, conscious of  his own worth, speaking by the spirit that vibrates through his whole  being and which overshadows his surroundings through the charm  of his personality. He looks what he is, the portrayer of princes, of  eminent men and of noble ladies, of Madonnas and Saints, and above  all the painter of the Man of Sorrows and the Mother of Woe.   Anthony was born in Antwerp on the 22nd March 1599. ^^is  father belonged to one of the highly respectable Burgher families  of the town. A few years ago the portrait of his Grandmother,  Cornelia Pruystinck, was discovered in the Modena Museum, and  the question arose whether the young artist had not perhaps copied  this picture from a portrait by some other artist ; van Dyck\'s  mother was celebrated | Question: Breugel; Van Dyck and Rubens were all citizens of which country?', ['belgium'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7578'), ('Context: Travelers faced many hardships along the Santa Fe Trail . The trail was a challenging 900 miles ( 1,400 km ) of arid plains , desert , and mountains . The natural climate was and is continental ; very hot and dry summers , coupled with long and bitterly cold winters . Freshwater was scarce , and the high steppe - like plains are nearly treeless . Water flows in the Pecos , Arkansas , Cimarron , and Canadian rivers that drain the region vary by 90 or more percent in their flows during an average year . Also on this trail , unlike the Oregon trail , there was a serious danger of Native American attacks , for neither the Comanches nor the Apaches of the southern high plains tolerated trespassers . In 1825 , Congress voted for federal protection for the Santa Fe Trail , even though much of it lay in the Mexican territory . Lack of food and water also made the trail very risky . Weather conditions , like huge lightning storms , gave the travelers even more difficulty . If a storm developed , there was often no place to take shelter and the livestock could get spooked . Rattlesnakes often posed a threat , and many people died due to snakebite . The caravan size increased later on to prevent Native American raids . The travelers also packed more oxen instead of mules because the Native Americans did not want to risk raiding the caravans only for some oxen . | Question: what was the terrain like on the santa fe trail ?', ['plains', 'desert', 'mountains'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-46162'), ("Context: After losing the toss , India were asked to bat first against a West Indies team that arguably boasted the world 's best bowling attack . Only Mohinder Amarnath ( 26 from 80 balls ) and Kris Srikkanth ( 38 from 57 balls ) put up any significant resistance as Andy Roberts , Malcolm Marshall , Joel Garner and Michael Holding ripped through the Indian batsmen , ably supported by Gomes . Surprising resistance by the tail allowed India to compile 183 ( all out , 54.4 overs ) . Only three sixes were hit in the Indian innings , one from Srikkanth , one from Sandeep Patil ( 27 from 29 balls ) , and one from Madan Lal ( 17 from 27 balls ) . However , the Indian bowling exploited the weather and pitch conditions perfectly to bowl out the best batting line - up of the era for 140 from 52 overs in return , winning by 43 runs and completing one of the most stunning upsets in cricket history , defeating the previously invincible West Indies . Amarnath and Madan Lal ( 3 -- 31 ) each took three wickets , and one memorable moment was the sight of Kapil Dev running a great distance ( about 18 -- 20 yards ) to take a catch to dismiss Richards , the West Indies top scorer with 33 from 28 balls .

A day after he seemed to compare handguns to cricket bats, Prince Philip said through a Buckingham Palace spokesman that he "had no intention whatsoever of causing offense or distress to anyone and he is sorry if he has done so." But Prince Philip, 75, the Duke of Edinburgh, declined to withdraw his comments made during a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  While Prince Philip expressed sympathy for the families of the 16 children and the teacher killed by Thomas Hamilton, he said in the interview that banning handguns was an irrational response to the Dunblane shootings.  Pending legislation would ban 160,000 high-caliber handguns in Britain.  "If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?" Prince Philip asked.  "I think one\'s got to make a difference between what the weapons can do and what the people can do," Prince Philip added. "And there are always going to be unstable people who are going to do monstrous things. We know that but I don\'t think it helps by taking it out on the rest of the population."  While gun owners and lobbyists welcomed the prince\'s remarks, others reacted with outrage.  Alison Crozier, whose 5-year-old daughter Emma was among those killed at Dunblane, described the prince\'s remarks as "outrageous" and "very insensitive."  "This is just the view of a very uninformed old man, an aristocrat. I think it has damaged the credibility of Prince Philip enormously," said George Robertson, a Dunblane resident and the Labor Party\'s Scottish secretary.  The Sun of London editorialized yesterday that Prince Philip "has shot himself in the foot. Few of us lie awake at night worrying about crazed cricketers."  Prince Philip is noted for his acid comments. He has made provocative remarks about Chinese, Hungarians and Scots, and once claimed that "British women can\'t cook."

In a radio interview on the BBC, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II  sought to raise the argument commonly advanced against laws curbing the private ownership of weapons -- that it is not guns that are to blame but the people who use them. But he did so with a simile that struck people as insensitive to the traumatic event in British life that gave rise to the legislation, the massacre last March of 16 schoolchildren and their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane by a man armed with four handguns.  Asked where the Duke stood in a debate that the interviewer noted had become \'\'a very sensitive issue in the aftermath of Dunblane,\'\' the Prince said, \'\'I sympathize desperately with the people who are bereaved at Dunblane.\'\' But then he added, \'\'Look, if a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which | Question: "Who famously said after the \'Dunblane Massacre\', ""If a cricketer for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats""?" ?', ['duke of edinburgh'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6259'), ("Context: The last lines of the poem , `` We / Die soon , '' indicate the climax , which comes as a surprise to the boasts that have been made previously .

The executive power of both the vice president and the president is granted under Article Two, Section One of the Constitution. The vice president is indirectly elected, together with the president, to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.  The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, and would normally ascend to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president.   The Office of the Vice President of the United States assists and organizes the vice president\'s official functions.  The vice president is also president of the United States Senate  and in that capacity only votes when it is necessary to break a tie. While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.   Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.  While the vice president\'s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments.  Origin  The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state\'s combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state\'s favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector\'s state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector\'s second vote would go to a statesman of national character.  Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son\'s chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot.  Roles of the vice president  The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression "only a heartbeat away from the presidency," and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate.  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.    President of the United States Senate  As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney\'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.  Regular duties  As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote.

The Azerbaijan capital of Baku will host the first European Games, with around 15 sports to be on the program for the event -- which will be held "in spring or early summer" according to the European Olympic Committees website .  The decision may put it in conflict with other sporting bodies. The International Athletics Federation will stage its world championships in Beijing in August 2015, while the swimming world championships will be held in Russia in July that year.  The European Games will come a year ahead of the next Summer Olympics, to be held in Brazil.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert.

He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him.

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology. Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) . What Arnott called proof through the “hard school of practical production” suggests an axiom that doing it by-hand is a kind of Occam’s razor for purifying and endorsing historical conjecture as common- | Question: To prove his theories of the diaspora of South American peoples, who sailed in a balsa raft called Kon Tiki across the Pacific Ocean in 1947?', ['ra ii', 'thor heyerdahl'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3515'), ('Context: Irène Jacob  Irène Marie Jacob (born 15 July 1966) is a French-Swiss actress known for her work with Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski.

U.S. Marshals (film)  U.S. Marshals is a 1998 American action crime thriller film directed by Stuart Baird.  The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Roy Huggins and John Pogue.  The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture "The Fugitive", which in turn was based on the 1960s television series of the same name, created by Huggins.  The story does not involve the character of Dr. Richard Kimble, portrayed by Harrison Ford in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by Tommy Lee Jones.  The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive Mark Warren, played by Wesley Snipes, who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal.

By 1850 there were seven railway termini located around the urban centre of London and the concept of an underground railway linking the City of London with these stations was first proposed in the 1830s . Charles Pearson , Solicitor to the City of London , was a leading promoter of several schemes , and he contributed to the creation of the City Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King 's Cross in 1852 . Although the plan was supported by the City of London , the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed . In 1854 the Metropolitan Railway ( also known as the Met ) was granted permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of £ 1 million . With the Crimean War under way , the Met found it hard to raise the capital , and construction did not start until March 1860 . The railway was mostly built using the `` cut - and - cover '' method from Paddington to King 's Cross ; east of King 's Cross it was built by tunnelling and then followed the culverted River Fleet in an open cutting to the new meat market at Smithfield . The 3.75 - mile ( 6 km ) railway opened to the public on 10 January 1863 , using steam locomotives hauling wooden carriages . It was hailed as a success , carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day , borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service .

The two meiotic divisions are known as Meiosis I and Meiosis II . Before meiosis begins , during S phase of the cell cycle , the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids , which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion . This S - phase can be referred to as `` premeiotic S - phase '' or `` meiotic S - phase '' . Immediately following DNA replication , meiotic cells enter a prolonged G2 - like stage known as meiotic prophase . During this time , homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo genetic recombination , a programmed process in which DNA is cut and then repaired , which allows them to exchange some of their genetic information . A subset of recombination events results in crossovers , which create physical links known as chiasmata ( singular : chiasma , for the Greek letter Chi ( X ) ) between the homologous chromosomes . In most organisms , these links are essential to direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to segregate away from each other during Meiosis I , resulting in two haploid cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell . During Meiosis II , the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another , as during mitosis . In some cases all four of the meiotic products form gametes such as sperm , spores , or pollen . In female animals , three of the four meiotic products are typically eliminated by extrusion into polar bodies , and only one cell develops to produce an ovum . | Question: the separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis is called ?", ['Meiosis I'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-18077'), ('Context: Collinwood Mansion is a house featured in the Gothic horror soap opera Dark Shadows ( 1966 -- 1971 ) .

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000. Wade only traveled to the Australian Open five times, but in 1972 stung another No. 1 seed when defeating crowd favorite and native Evonne Goolagong, who was in the midst of playing in seven consecutive Australian finals, | Question: Prior to Viginia Wade in 1977 who was the last British player to win a tennis Grand Slam title?', ['sue barker'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5406'), ('Context: The maximum strength of the House allotted by the Constitution of India is 552 .

In 1769 , Sgt José Francisco Ortega , the leader of a scouting party sent north along the San Francisco Peninsula by Don Gaspar de Portolá from their expedition encampment in San Pedro Valley to locate the Point Reyes headlands , reported back to Portolá that he could not reach the location because of his encounter with the strait . On 5 August 1775 Juan de Ayala and the crew of his ship San Carlos became the first Europeans known to have passed through the strait , anchoring in a cove behind Angel Island , the cove now named in Ayala 's honor . Until the 1840s , the strait was called the `` Boca del Puerto de San Francisco '' ( `` Mouth of the Port of San Francisco '' ) . On 1 July 1846 , before the discovery of gold in California , the entrance acquired a new name . In his memoirs , John C. Frémont wrote , `` To this Gate I gave the name of `` Chrysopylae '' , or `` Golden Gate '' ; for the same reasons that the harbor of Byzantium was called Chrysoceras , or Golden Horn .

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

The Philippines , the Philippine Sea , and the Pacific Ocean are to the north; the Arafura Sea and the island of Timor are to the south.  The islands comprise the two Indonesian propinsi (or provinsi; provinces) of North Maluku (Maluku Utara) and Maluku . The principal islands of North Maluku are Halmahera , Obi , Morotai , Bacan , and the main islands of the Sula archipelago (Taliabu, Mangole, and Sulabesi); significant smaller islands include Ternate and Tidore . To the south, the province of Maluku encompasses , most notably, the islands of Ceram (Seram), Buru , and Ambon , as well as the Banda , Wetar , Babar , Tanimbar , Kai , and Aru archipelagos. Area 30,462 square miles (78,897 square km). Pop. (2000) 1,981,401; (2010) 2,571,593.  Geography  Most of the Moluccas are mountainous, although the Tanimbar and Aru island groups are low and swampy. Earthquakes are frequent, and several islands, especially Ternate and Banda , have active volcanoes . The climate of the Moluccas is tropical, with rainfall varying from 80 to 150 inches (2,000 to 3,800 mm) annually in various locations. Some of the land has been cleared for cultivation, but other areas remain covered with evergreen rainforest . There are patches of open savanna , and the coasts are often fringed with mangrove swamps. The Moluccas are a transition zone between Asian and Australian fauna and flora, and the animal life and vegetation of the islands include many species that are unique to the region.  The population of the islands is diverse , with the Ambonese, Butonese (people from the island of Buton in Southeast Sulawesi ), and Kai peoples together constituting roughly one-third of the islands’ residents in relatively equal numbers. Most of the remainder of the population consists of scores of smaller groups, many living in sparsely settled inland regions, as well a notable minority of Chinese descent, concentrated primarily in larger towns and urban areas. The principal cities of the Moluccas include Ambon (on the island of Ambon ), in the central region, and Ternate (on the island of Ternate ), in the north.  Similar Topics  Andaman Islands  Dozens of languages are spoken in the Moluccas, although Malay (of which the national language, Indonesian, is a dialect) has for centuries been used as a lingua franca ; in many areas, Malay has eclipsed local languages. Christianity (mostly Protestant ) and Islam are the dominant religions. A small but notable minority practices Hinduism or Buddhism , and some communities in the interior regions follow local religions. Except in northern Halmahera , Morotai , Ternate, Tidore, and several other areas of the northern Moluccas—where West Papuan languages are spoken—all languages spoken in the islands belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.  Most residents are engaged in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Rice, coconuts, and cocoa are widely grown, and fish, forest products, copra , and spices are among the most significant exports. Petroleum is mined in limited quantities, primarily on Ceram.  History  The cloves of the northern Moluccas and the nutmeg of the central islands were traded in Asia long before Europeans heard of the so-called Spice Islands . The Portuguese established themselves on the islands in 1512, beginning many decades of conflict that caused great losses of life. The first major confrontation was between the Portuguese and the reigning sultans of Ternate and Tidore ; later, the Spanish, English, and Dutch wrestled for control of the islands. Eventually, the Dutch emerged victorious, and they earned large profits from their enterprise in the Moluccas. By the end of the 18th century, however, the spice trade had greatly diminished, and the islands had become an economic backwater.

Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images  Chinese Ribbon Dance Facts  "Dance of the Reed Pipes," also known as "Dance of the Mirlitons," "Dance of the Flutes" or "Marzipan," is a dramatic musical selection from "The Nutcracker" -- one of the most celebrated ballets of all time. "The Nutcracker" was originally performed on Dec. 5, 1892 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The beautifully infectious and vibrant piece was also featured in the 1940 Disney Classic, "Fantasia." "Dance of the Reed Pipes" is the highlight of the second act of "The Nutcracker" ballet.  what is a fallback  Musical Composition  The piece is played in the key of D major, the range of D4-Bb6, the time signature 2/4, meaning it has two beats per measure instead of four, and a tempo of 72 beats per minute, or Moderato Assai (very moderate). It uses a three-part, ternary form of A-B-A, which means the first and third parts (A) are identical, whereas the second part (B) contrasts sharply. Typically, an A-B-A arrangement has no chorus and is written as a thematic melody. The string accompaniment is in the key of D major, and the brass section performs in the key of f# minor with a steady eighth note pulse.  Instrumentation  Wind instruments provide the primary instrumentation for "Dance of the Reed Pipes." Wind instruments include the oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, French horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba and timpani. Cymbals give the piece dramatic climax throughout. The string section includes the bass, cello and viola. "Dance of the Reed Pipes" begins with a gentle plucking of the strings, followed by the flute\'s main melody, the gradual accompaniment and solo of the English horn, a joining of the trumpets and percussion, then ends with a final flute solo.  Tchaikovsky  Pyotr Ilych Tchaikovsky -- normally Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky in English -- was born on May 7, 1840 in Votkinsk, Russia and died on Nov. 6, 1893 in St. Petersburg. He was a composer of the Romantic era. His works include six symphonies and some of the world\'s most performed ballets, including "Swan Lake," "The Nutcracker" and "Sleeping Beauty." Popular pieces from "The Nutcracker" include "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" and "Dance of the Reed Pipes." He dedicated much of his talents to the composition of dramatic, orchestral, chamber or vocal music.  "The Nutcracker"  "The Nutcracker" was written as a two-act ballet from a popular Christmas tale by the 18th century German writer E.T.A. Hoffman. The exquisite musical flavor of the story is delivered through such illustrious pieces as "Miniature Overture," "March," "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy," "Trepak, Russian Dance," "Arabian Dance," "Dance of the Reed Pipes" and "Waltz of the Flowers." "The Nutcracker" story begins with the children opening their much anticipated presents. One of the gifts, a charming doll, breaks during the brother\'s attempt to crack a nut in its mouth. The girl becomes terribly upset and the family drawing room becomes invaded by an army of mice. The doll miraculously transforms into a handsome soldier prince and leads the battle against the evil mice. When victory comes and peace is restored, the girl and the prince embark upon a journey to the enchanted Kingdom of Sweets governed by the Sugar Plum Fairy.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

Co-founders Alex Turner and James Cook had attended a Libertines show in 2001 and subsequently, for Christmas, had asked for guitars. The initial lineup featured Turner and Cook on guitar, with Matt Helders on drums and Andy Nicholson on bass. Glyn Jones was the original singer but left after a few months and before the band had even played a gig. Turner, who had been somewhat reticent to take over the vocals, suddenly found himself in the position of becoming the band’s lead singer. For a while, the Arctic Monkeys were just another high school band, as they messed around and learned to play their instruments by coverings songs by the likes of The White Stripes and The Vines.  \xa0  Everything, however, happened fast for the Arctic Monkeys. They played their first show at The Grapes in Sheffield. As their crowds began to increase the band started to burn demos and pass them out for free at their shows hoping that this word of mouth approach would lead to even more energetic gigs. The band was also one of the first to profit from MySpace, although the members claimed total ignorance of both the site and how its music got on to it. Whether they knew much about MySpace or not the band began to attract a buzz across Northern England with little radio support or traditional promotion.  \xa0  They also began to release new recordings. Their first EP Five Minutes With Arctic Monkeys (2005 Domino) only contained two songs; “From The Ritz To The Rubble” and their first to attract real attention, “Fake Tales Of San Francisco.” The latter exhibits elements of what would come to be recognized as the Monkeys’ signature tone and style; namely Turner’s brash and braying vocals supported skillfully by the tight playing of Helders and Nicholson. In the song Turner attacks the perceived posturing and posing supposedly rampant in the northern scene. Turner’s snotty lyrics have become a central feature of Arctic Monkey songs which most critics have hailed as honest and raw while others have regarded them as shallow and superficial.  \xa0  The band at first held off on making a record deal, even going so far as to refuse guaranteed guest entry for label scouts seeking to attend their shows. Human nature being what it is this only made labels want to sign them even more.\xa0 Not surprisingly the strategy worked wonderfully and the Arctic Monkeys eventually signed with Domino Records (home of the Clinic and Franz Ferdinand) in late ‘05. For the band it was a chance to sign with a small label that would focus its energies on them. For Domino, it was the chance to license some of the overseas rights to EMI.  \xa0  The benefits to both Domino and Arctic Monkeys were immediately apparent when their next single “I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor” went straight to the top of the British charts, initially selling 38,962 copies. In the song the Monkeys capture the essence of being young and horny on the dance floor with equal measures of ennui, lust, and irony. At the same time they craft a rhythm and melody that are highly danceable. Their second single, “When The Sun Goes Down” also went straight to number one.  \xa0  The album Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (Domino) was released on January 23rd 2006. The album, amazingly, sold 363,735 units in the first week making it the fastest selling debut in UK history. At this point the hype for the band became white-hot in England and they won NME awards for Best British Band, Best New Band, and Best Track for “I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor.” While some of the praise was no doubt deserved, it also positioned the band for a king-hell of a letdown at some point.  \xa0  The letdown, arguably, came in the United States.

In 1862 he devised an early form of periodic table , which he named Vis tellurique ( the ' telluric helix ' ) , after the element tellurium , which fell near the center of his diagram . With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight , de Chancourtois saw that elements with similar properties lined up vertically . His 1863 publication included a chart ( which contained ions and compounds , in addition to elements ) , but his original paper in the Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram .

The premise of the scene , that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert ( and like - minded visitors ) to float into the air , can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can `` lighten '' a mood . ( Compare Peter Pan 's flight power , which is also powered by happy thoughts . ) Conversely , thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors `` down to earth '' again .

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ("Context: The Bachelor of Business Administration ( BBA or B.B.A. ) is a bachelor 's degree in commerce and business administration . | Question: is a business major a ba or bs ?", ['BBA'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-49555'), ('Context: Gifford Pinchot State Park is a 2,338 - acre ( 946 ha ) Pennsylvania state park in northern York County , Pennsylvania , in the United States .

But Microsoft, maker of Kinect and Xbox, immediately shot down any speculation that the game will pass the certification process.  Kinect enables video game players to move characters through the use of real-life movements made possible by 3-D object scanning and manipulation. Kinect uses cameras and microphones to track movement and voice commands as a controller.  So the Web was buzzing earlier this week when ThriXXX, an Austria-based game company, posted a YouTube video featuring a graphic demo of a 3-D adult game using the controller for Xbox 360.  But when Microsoft was asked about the prospects of the game actually making it to the video game console, a\xa0spokesperson said in a statement that it wasn\'t going to happen.\xa0  "This isn\'t the first example of a technology being used in ways not intended by its manufacturer, and it won\'t be the last," the statement said.  "Microsoft did not authorize or license its technology for this use," it said. "Xbox is a family friendly games and entertainment console and does not allow Adults Only (AO) content to be certified for use on its platform, and would not condone this type of game for Kinect."

Ishmael means ‘God hears’.\xa0Hagar was lost twice, but\xa0God heard her cry for help.  Note: At the beginning of the story of Hagar, Sarah and Abraham are called Sarai and Abram; later in the story, God makes a promise to them, a covenant, and changes their names to Sarah and Abraham. To minimize confusion,\xa0‘Sarah’ and ‘Abraham’ are used throughout.  Main themes of the story  Nothing is impossible to God. God had promised Abraham he would be the father of many nations, so when Sarah became post-menopausal she looked for ways to make this happen. She did not trust in God enough to leave the matter in His hands.  The foundation of the Arab nations.  According to the Koran, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael were ancestors of the Arab nations, and of the prophet Mohammed. The Koran says it was at Mecca that God saved Hagar and her son from death by thirst. Muslim ritual reflects this: every year for thirteen centuries Muslims performing the Hajj have retraced Hagar’s steps as she desperately searched for water.  Hagar represents women in the Bible who are excluded or despised. This might happen because they are childless in a society that valued mothers (as Sarah was at first) or a slave in a hierarchical society (as Hagar was at first).  Mother and beloved child  The story has two episodes:  1 The conception and birth of Hagar’s son Ishmael ( Genesis 16:1-16 ). Hagar was an Egyptian slave girl in the tribe of Abraham. She belonged to Sarah, the alpha female of the tribe. When Sarah could not conceive she gave Hagar to her husband as a surrogate. Hagar became pregnant, and God promised that her child would be the ancestor of a great nation. She bore a son, Ishmael.  2 The expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael ( Genesis 21:1-21 ). Hagar was never fully accepted into the tribe despite being the mother of Abraham’s child, and in the end she was rejected completely and expelled into the desert. But God protected her twice from Sarah’s hatred by sending an angel, and eventually Hagar lived as a free woman, not a slave.  See MAPS OF BIBLE LANDS for the location of this story  Hagar —\xa0victim? or upwardly mobile?  Read Genesis 16:1-16  The story of Hagar took place during the late Bronze Age between 2000 and 1550BC, corresponding to the Middle Kingdom period in Egyptian history.  Hagar was an Egyptian girl who was a slave in the household of Sarah, a Hebrew princess. Sarah may have acquired Hagar as part of the generous bride-price paid to her husband Abraham by Pharaoh in Egypt (this story is in Genesis 12:10-20 ).  Ancient wall painting of beautiful Egyptian women  It was an accepted practice at the time to give servants and slaves as part of the dowry of a wealthy young woman. If Hagar was a gift from Pharaoh, she was probably an accomplished servant with valuable skills. Becoming the servant of a nomadic tribeswoman may have been a step down socially for her.  You might take a look at Egyptian love poems in Women in the Bible: the story of Potiphar’s Wife: it will give you some idea of the comparative sophistication of the Egyptians.  Hagar was always disadvantaged among the Hebrew women because she was a foreigner and a slave. This was ironic, since she came from a land that was socially and politically advanced and possessed cities, temples and elaborate burial sites. Egypt had a complex economic system that regulated trade and commerce throughout its empire, and its theology and religion were sophisticated and well ordered.

Phlebotomists Duties: What Exactly does a Phlebotomist do?  written by: Victoria Trix•edited by: DaniellaNicole•updated: 1/31/2009  You may have heard the term Phlebotomist but what exactly are the duties of a Phlebotomist and what does a Phlebotomist do?  slide 1 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties  Phlebotomists duties and responsibilities center around the obtaining and proper handling of human blood. The basic services of the phlebotomist include taking blood samples from patients and correctly cataloging them for lab analysis, but the importance of the phlebotomist is far more critical than this simple description implies.  slide 2 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Critical Responsibilities  Since phlebotomists have an extremely high potential to be exposed to blood borne diseases and contaminants, the level of caution and expertise they use in the execution of their duties is critical to their own safety as well as all others that may be exposed to the fluid samples they draw. Under the direction of a physician or other licensed health care professional, phlebotomists duties includes collecting samples of blood and other fluids from patients. Prior to collection, it is the phlebotomist’s responsibility to assure that all collection instruments and environments are sterile and of first use.  After sample collection, the phlebotomists duties will include correctly labeling the collection container with pertinent patient information for identification, and subsequently must complete and file companion paperwork to trace the route of the sample from collection through lab work through final analysis and diagnosis and finally to proper disposal of the fluids. Any error in the job of a phlebotomist can have consequences that range from misdiagnosis to fatal contamination. In addition, phlebotomists on a hospital staff will also be required to train other phlebotomists in sample collection and follow up.  slide 3 of 5  Additional Phlebotomists Duties  Some phlebotomists duties, for example those that conduct home care visits, will also include being responsible for transportation of fluid samples between the sample site and the laboratory. In some cases the phlebotomists duties will also include being responsible for performing certain functions to process blood samples for further analysis by attending medical professionals.  Phlebotomists that work in a laboratory environment have the added task of ensuring that samples are correctly analyzed by enforcing quality control and safety measures to prevent the contamination of samples during analysis.  slide 4 of 5  Phlebotomists Duties: Education and Career  Phlebotomy training is obtained by passing a one year vocational program which is offered through technical schools or community colleges. Many community colleges also offer associate’s degree programs in phlebotomy. In addition to becoming certified as a phlebotomist, some states will require licensing or registration.  A certified phlebotomist can expect an annual salary ranging from $20,000 to $48,000, with an increase in demand for services expected through 2012. As the demand increases, more facilities will require pre-certification of phlebotomists before they are hired, to reduce the impact of liability.  Phlebotomists' duties and services are usually scheduled, rather than performed under emergency situations. Given this fact, phlebotomists usually have the benefit of shift hours that match regular office hours, which is a luxury not typically found in the medical profession.  slide 5 of 5 | Question: What does a phlebotomist usually deal with?", ['taking blood'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3552'), ('Context: Friendship Day celebrations occur on different dates in different countries .

Movie Review - - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE ...Movie Review -    - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE - NYTimes.com  SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE  By JANET MASLIN  Published: March     9, 1984  THOUGH Ron Howard's comedies don't adhere to any familiar formulas - Mr. Howard's funny ''Night Shift'' was about a prostitution ring operating out of a morgue, and his even more disarming new ''Splash'' is about a mermaid in Manhattan - they have a comfortably old-fashioned flavor. ''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

Uranus is the ancient Greek deity of the Heavens, the earliest supreme god. Uranus was the son and mate of Gaia the father of Cronus (Saturn) and of the Cyclopes and Titans (predecessors of the Olympian gods).  Uranus, the first planet discovered in modern times, was discovered by William Herschel while systematically searching        the sky with his telescope on March 13, 1781.        It had actually been seen many times before but ignored as simply another star        (the earliest recorded sighting was in 1690 when John Flamsteed       cataloged it as 34 Tauri).        Herschel named it "the\xa0Georgium\xa0Sidus"        (the Georgian Planet) in honor of his patron,        the infamous (to Americans) King George III of England; others called it        "Herschel".  The name "Uranus" was        first proposed by Bode in conformity with the        other planetary names from classical mythology but didn\'t come into        common use until 1850.  Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 on Jan 24 1986.  Most of the planets spin on an axis nearly perpendicular to the plane of        the ecliptic but Uranus\' axis is almost        parallel to the ecliptic.        At the time of Voyager 2\'s passage,        Uranus\' south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun.        This results in the odd fact that Uranus\' polar regions receive more energy        input from the Sun than do its equatorial regions.        Uranus is nevertheless hotter at its equator than at its poles. The mechanism        underlying this is unknown.  Actually, there\'s an ongoing battle over which of Uranus\'        poles is its north pole!  Either its axial inclination is a bit over 90        degrees and its rotation is direct ,        or it\'s a bit less than 90 degrees and the rotation is retrograde .        The problem is that you need to draw a dividing line *somewhere*, because        in a case like Venus there is little dispute        that the rotation is indeed        retrograde (not a direct rotation with an inclination of nearly 180).  Uranus is composed primarily of rock and various ices ,        with only about 15% hydrogen and a little helium (in contrast to Jupiter and Saturn which are mostly hydrogen).        Uranus (and Neptune) are in many ways similar to the cores of Jupiter and        Saturn minus the massive liquid metallic hydrogen envelope.        It appears that Uranus does not have a rocky core like Jupiter and Saturn        but rather that its material is more or less uniformly distributed.  Uranus\' atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane.  Like the other gas planets, Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around  rapidly.  But they are extremely faint, visible only with radical image        enhancement of the Voyager 2 pictures        (right).        Recent observations with HST (left) show larger and        more pronounced streaks.        Further HST observations show even more activity.   Uranus is no longer the bland boring planet that Voyager saw! It now seems clear that the differences are due to        seasonal effects since the Sun is now at a  lower Uranian latitude which may        cause more pronounced day/night weather effects.   By 2007 the Sun will be directly over Uranus\'s equator.  Uranus\' blue color is the result of absorption of red light by methane in the        upper atmosphere.

Only one pane of 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in all philately. A single Inverted Jenny was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in November 2007 for $977,500. In December 2007 a mint never hinged example was sold for $825,000. The broker of the sale said the buyer was a Wall Street executive who had lost the auction the previous month.  A block of four inverted Jennys was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in October 2005 for $2.7 million.  In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, prices fetched by Inverted Jennys have receded. Between January and September 2014, five examples offered at auction sold for sums ranging from $126,000 through $575,100.  Prices seem since to have recovered, for on May 31, 2016, a particularly well-centered Jenny invert, graded XF-superb 95 by Professional Stamp Experts, was sold for at a Siegel Auction for a hammer price of $1,175,000   The addition of a 15% buyer’s premium raised the total record high price paid for this copy to $1,351,250.  Background  During the 1910s, the United States Post Office had made a number of experimental trials of carrying mail by air. These were shown by the first stamp in the world to picture an airplane (captioned as "aeroplane carrying mail"), one of the U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 1912–13.  The Post Office finally decided to inaugurate regular service on May 15, 1918, flying between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The Post Office set a controversial rate of 24 cents for the service, much higher than the 3 cents for first-class mail of the time, and decided to issue a new stamp just for this rate, patriotically printed in red and blue, and depicting a Curtiss Jenny JN-4HM, the biplane especially modified for shuttling the mail. The stamp\'s designer, Clair Aubrey Houston, apparently troubled to procure a photograph of that modified model (produced by removing the second pilot seat from the JN-4HT to create space for mailbags, and by increasing the fuel capacity). As only six such aircraft existed, there was a 1-in-6 chance that the very plane engraved on the stamp by Marcus Baldwin—Jenny #38262—would be chosen to launch the inaugural three-city airmail run; the plane on the stamp was indeed the first to depart on May 15th, taking off from Washington at 11:47 A. M.   The job of designing and printing the new stamp was carried out in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.  Many collectors long thought the blue plane portion was printed first, thus it was actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first and it is the planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, it can be seen that the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames.

In the muscle , there are groups of highly specialized cells that work together to perform a function known as muscle contraction . A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is known as a microfilament . Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin . During contraction of a muscle , within each muscle cell , myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments . Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum . Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins , tropomyosin and troponin . Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin , while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition .

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] | Question: What is another term for rotors?", ['rotating discs'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3467'), ('Context: Uranus - Educational facts and history of the planet Uranus.Uranus - Educational facts and history of the planet Uranus.

Uranus is larger in diameter but smaller in mass than Neptune  Planet Profile  orbit : 2,870,990,000 km (19.218 AU ) from Su  diameter : 51,118 km (equatorial)  Careful pronunciation may be necessary        to avoid embarrassment; say "YOOR\xa0a\xa0nus"\xa0  , not  "your anus" or "urine us".  Uranus is the ancient Greek deity of the Heavens, the earliest supreme god. Uranus was the son and mate of Gaia the father of Cronus (Saturn) and of the Cyclopes and Titans (predecessors of the Olympian gods).  Uranus, the first planet discovered in modern times, was discovered by William Herschel while systematically searching        the sky with his telescope on March 13, 1781.        It had actually been seen many times before but ignored as simply another star        (the earliest recorded sighting was in 1690 when John Flamsteed       cataloged it as 34 Tauri).        Herschel named it "the\xa0Georgium\xa0Sidus"        (the Georgian Planet) in honor of his patron,        the infamous (to Americans) King George III of England; others called it        "Herschel".  The name "Uranus" was        first proposed by Bode in conformity with the        other planetary names from classical mythology but didn\'t come into        common use until 1850.  Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 on Jan 24 1986.  Most of the planets spin on an axis nearly perpendicular to the plane of        the ecliptic but Uranus\' axis is almost        parallel to the ecliptic.        At the time of Voyager 2\'s passage,        Uranus\' south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun.        This results in the odd fact that Uranus\' polar regions receive more energy        input from the Sun than do its equatorial regions.        Uranus is nevertheless hotter at its equator than at its poles. The mechanism        underlying this is unknown.  Actually, there\'s an ongoing battle over which of Uranus\'        poles is its north pole!  Either its axial inclination is a bit over 90        degrees and its rotation is direct ,        or it\'s a bit less than 90 degrees and the rotation is retrograde .        The problem is that you need to draw a dividing line *somewhere*, because        in a case like Venus there is little dispute        that the rotation is indeed        retrograde (not a direct rotation with an inclination of nearly 180).  Uranus is composed primarily of rock and various ices ,        with only about 15% hydrogen and a little helium (in contrast to Jupiter and Saturn which are mostly hydrogen).        Uranus (and Neptune) are in many ways similar to the cores of Jupiter and        Saturn minus the massive liquid metallic hydrogen envelope.        It appears that Uranus does not have a rocky core like Jupiter and Saturn        but rather that its material is more or less uniformly distributed.  Uranus\' atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane.  Like the other gas planets, Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around  rapidly.  But they are extremely faint, visible only with radical image        enhancement of the Voyager 2 pictures        (right).        Recent observations with HST (left) show larger and        more pronounced streaks.        Further HST observations show even more activity.   Uranus is no longer the bland boring planet that Voyager saw! It now seems clear that the differences are due to        seasonal effects since the Sun is now at a  lower Uranian latitude which may        cause more pronounced day/night weather effects.   By 2007 the Sun will be directly over Uranus\'s equator.  Uranus\' blue color is the result of absorption of red light by methane in the        upper atmosphere.

Belfast West was the fourth by-election held since the 2010 General Election. There were 6 candidates on the ballot paper.  The by-election was called after the former MP, Gerry Adams, vacated his seat.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).

Adams initially refused to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds or manor of Northstead, instead attempting to resign by writing to the Speaker. He was subsequently appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead. The by-election was held on the 9th June and was a easy hold for Sinn Fein.

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria\'s approach was           significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte           Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste           Libeault of the Nancy           School .

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists.

Synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron , which activates voltage - dependent calcium channels to allow calcium ions to enter the neuron . Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins ( synaptotagmin ) on synaptic vesicles , triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft . In vertebrates , motor neurons release acetylcholine ( ACh ) , a small molecule neurotransmitter , which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber , also known as the sarcolemma . nAChRs are ionotropic receptors , meaning they serve as ligand - gated ion channels .

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule. The United States joined the war on the side of South     Vietnam in 1961, but withdrew combat troops in 1973. In 1975 North Vietnam     succeeded in taking control of South Vietnam.

She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated.

It was the only sequel to win a Best Picture                   Oscar at the time of its win. [An earlier unsuccessful attempt                   at a sequel-Best Picture win was The Bells of St. Mary\'s                     (1945) - following the Best Picture winner of the previous                   year - Going My Way (1944). Later, its \'sequel\' The                     Godfather, Part III (1990) was also nominated for Best                   Picture - and lost, and two sequel-installments of The                     Lord of the Rings (2002, 2003) were also nominated,                   with the latter winning the top honor.

Five of its six un-rewarded nominations were                   for acting roles.  [Francis Ford Coppola had previously won two Oscars                     for himself - for the Best Story and Screenplay for Patton                       (1970) and the Best Adapted Screenplay (a shared                     award) for  The                       Godfather (1972) . With his new honors in 1974, he                     would add three more awards: Best Picture (as producer),                     Best Director, and Best Screenplay Adaptation (again shared                     with Mario Puzo). It was an unprecedented win for Coppola                     - three Oscars for writing, producing, and directing                     the same film.]  (Note: A triple win had also occurred for Leo McCarey                     in 1944, Billy Wilder in 1960, James L.

For the first time since 1951, when individual producers rather than companies were cited in the Best Picture nominations,                     both producers Francis Ford Coppola (and Fred Roos) were honored                     by receiving two Best Picture nominations in the same year,                     for Coppola\'s The Conversation (1974) and                     for their shared winner:  The                       Godfather | Question: Which legendary dancer was Oscar-nominated for The Towering Inferno?', ['fred astaire'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-83'), ('Context: Collectible Ian Fleming Books - abebooks.comCollectible Ian Fleming Books  Home › Collectible Ian Fleming Books  Collectible Ian Fleming Books  True first edition, first printing  by Ian Fleming  Fleming. Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett. For the reader dedicated to collectible Ian Fleming books, there are many first edition James Bond books in various printings, conditions and price points to suit every collector\'s desires.

The new concept called "LOVE Radio", which featured a limited selection of music genres, was launched on ABC\'s seven owned-and-operated FM stations in late November 1968; the concept replaced nearly all of the programming provided by these stations; however, several affiliates (such as KXYZ) retained the majority of their content.

Peter Paul Rubens arguably is the most famous Flemish painter. Born in 1577 in Germany from Flemish parents, he moved to Antwerp with his mother in 1589. During his youth he studied Latin and classic literature, and painting under Antwerp's leading painters of the time.  During early adulthood Rubens travelled to Italy where the studied and became influenced by the Italian masters of the time.   In 1609 he came back to Antwerp. At the time Antwerp started to prosper again, with a recent truce established in the armed conflicts between Habsburg Spain (occupying the Southern Netherlands or present day Flanders) and the Dutch Republic to the north.  Self-portrait by Peter Paul Rubens - Rubenshuis Museum, Antwerp.  Rubens moved into a new house with studio that he designed himself. This house is now known as the Rubenshuis Museum, off the main shopping street of Antwerp (the Meir), and located in the Wapper street. Rubens had many apprentices, working in his studio, including the young Anthony Van Dyck.     It is during that time, that the two altarpieces now in the Cathedral of our Lady in Antwerp, were produced.  Interesting is that Rubens made good use of the distribution facilities of the time, by producing many prints of his works, for distribution in Europe. He even established copyrights for his prints.  Rubens left Antwerp again in 1621, living in France, England and Spain. He was also active as a diplomat, entrusted by the Spanish Habsburg rulers with diplomatic missions.          As a result op these travels, a lot of the paintings of this period are now in various European museums.         However, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (1625-1626) was painted for the Cathedral of Antwerp.          Rubens eventually came back to Antwerp in the last decade of his life (1630-1640), and in 1630 at age 53, he married his second wife, the 16-year old Helene Fourment, who reportedly became one of his most favoured models during the latter days of his life.  Peter Paul  Rubens was a prolific artist. He also co-produced lots of art work with his apprentices and fellow painters. On top of that, he was an active art designer. His paintings are now famed for the depiction of voluptuous women, so much so that the term 'Rubenesque' is to this day used for somewhat over-sized females. To be sure, also the males in many of his religious paintings, are oversized, and not exactly by an abundance of muscles.  Last time I checked, a painting of Rubens, 'Massacre of the Innocents', still holds the record as the most expensive painting by an old master, sold at auction (Sotheby's, 49.5 million Pounds).

Peter Davison was chosen due to his critically acclaimed role as Tristan Farnon in the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small which had Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner as line producer . [1]  The Fifth Doctor\'s era was notable for a "back to the basics" attitude, in which "silly" humour (and, to an extent, horror) was kept to a minimum, and more scientific accuracy was encouraged by the producer, John Nathan-Turner . It was, at times, a darker and grittier series, in part for seeing the death of one of his companions, Adric . It was also notable for the reintroduction of many of the Time Lord \'s enemies, such as the Master , Cybermen , Omega (a founding-father of Gallifrey ), the Black and White Guardians , and the Silurians .  \xa0 Biography  The Fourth Doctor \'s regeneration into the Fifth was a problematic one, and nearly failed, with the Doctor briefly taking on personality aspects from his four previous incarnations. After recovering in the fictional city Castrovalva (actually an elaborate trap created by his arch-enemy The Master ), he continued his travels with Tegan Jovanka , Nyssa and Adric . Initially his travels centred on getting Tegan back to Heathrow Airport in time for her first day as an airhostess, but the TARDIS repeatedly missed this destination and Tegan eventually decided to stay in the TARDIS. After trips to the future and the past encountering villains such as Monarch and the Mara , the Fifth Doctor was confronted with tragedy when Adric died trying to stop a space freighter from crashing into prehistoric Earth ( Earthshock ).  Following Adric\'s death, the TARDIS accidentally arrived at Heathrow airport ( Time-Flight ). Here the Doctor and Nyssa left Tegan assuming she would want to stay (when in fact she did not any more). The Doctor and Nyssa then travelled together for an unspecified amount of time before the renegade Time Lord Omega , attempting to return to our universe, temporally bonded himself to the Doctor ( Arc of Infinity ). Faced with this threat, the Time Lords were forced to attempt executing the Doctor, but he eventually tracked Omega to Amsterdam where he defeated him and re-encountered Tegan (who having now lost her job, had no second thoughts about rejoining the TARDIS crew).  When the Doctor met a new companion , an alien boy stranded on Earth by the name of Vislor Turlough , he did not know that Turlough had been commissioned by the Black Guardian to kill him. Soon after, Nyssa left to help cure Lazar\'s Disease on the space station Terminus . After meeting the entities known as Eternals racing in yacht-like spacecraft for the prize of " Enlightenment ", Turlough broke free from the Black Guardian\'s influence, and continued to travel with the Doctor and Tegan. Landing in the reign of King John, the crew again encountered The Master, who was using a shape-shifting robot Kamelion to impersonate the King. However, the Doctor helped Kamelion to regain his free will and the robot joined him in his travels (although he rarely left the TARDIS). The Doctor met three of his previous incarnations when they were summoned to the Death Zone on Gallifrey by President Borusa , who was attempting to gain Rassilon \'s secret of immortality.  After further adventures in which the Doctor re-encountered old foes, including the Silurians and the Sea Devils , both Tegan and Turlough left the TARDIS. Tegan would find the death and violence they encountered on their travels too much to bear ( Resurrection of the Daleks ), and Turlough returned to his home planet of Trion in the company of his younger brother, as well as other | Question: Which actor was the fifth Doctor Who from 1982-1984, and in that role often wore Edwardian cricket costume?', ['peter davison'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4584'), ('Context: The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency.

Temple Square consists of the Salt Lake Temple, the Tabernacle (home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir), the Assembly Hall and two visitors’ centers.  To the east of Temple Square is a plaza where the Church Office Building, Church Administration Building, Joseph Smith Memorial Building and Relief Society Building are located. All of these buildings are used for offices for Church departments and general leadership.  West of Temple Square is the Family History Library — the world’s largest genealogical facility — and the Museum of Church History and Art.  North of Temple Square sits the Conference Center — a 21,000-seat auditorium, one of the largest in the world. It is used for semiannual meetings broadcast worldwide for the entire Church membership, as well as frequent closed-circuit conferences broadcast to specific groups of members in different parts of the world.

John Smith (13 September 1938 - 12 May 1994) served as Leader of the Labour Party from July 1992 until his sudden death from a heart attack in May 1994. Smith was born in Dalmally, the son of a Headmaster, and grew up in Ardrishaig in Argyll and Bute. He attended Dunoon Grammar School(Dunoon, Cowal), lodging in the town with a landlady and going home only during the holidays, before enrolling at the University of Glasgow, where he studied History from the Autumn of 1956 to 1959, and then Law, from 1959 to 1962. He joined the Labour Party in 1956.  John Smith’s birth place in Dalmally  He became involved in debating with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society and the Glasgow University Union. In 1962, he won The Observer Mace debating competition, speaking with Gordon Hunter. In 1995, after his death, the competition was renamed the John Smith Memorial Mace in his honour.After graduating, Smith practised as a solicitor for a year. He was then elected to the Faculty of Advocates, and later to the British Parliament as an MP. He took silk, becoming a Queens Counsel in 1983.  Smith first stood as a Labour parliamentary candidate at a by-election in 1961 in the East Fife constituency, and contested that seat again in the 1964 general election. At the 1970 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Lanarkshire succeeding Peggy Herbison. Smith defied the Labour whips in 1971, joining the Labour MPs who, led by Roy Jenkins, voted in favour of entry to the European Economic Community. These included Roy Hattersley, Shirley Williams, Bill Rodgers and David Owen all of whom he was later to sit with in the Callaghan cabinet.  In October 1974, Harold Wilson offered Smith the post of Solicitor General for Scotland. Smith turned it down, not wishing his political career to become side-lined as a law officer. He was instead made an Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy. In December 1975 he was made a Minister of State.  When James Callaghan became Prime Minister, Smith became a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office, serving with Labour's Deputy leader, Michael Foot, the Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons. In this position Smith piloted the highly controversial devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales through the House of Commons. Smith's adroit handling of these proposals impressed Callaghan, and in November 1978, when Edmund Dell retired, Callaghan appointed Smith Secretary of State for Trade.

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy .

Uploaded on Jun 7, 2010  Nebuchadnezzar was the mighty King of the Babylonian Empire between 604 and 562 BC. Numerous cuneiform tablets and ancient texts speak of his wondrous achievements and prideful character. "Look at this, Babylon the great! And I built it all by myself, a royal palace adequate to display my honor and glory." Nebuchadnezzar trusted in his immense wealth and powerful warriors -- He had no room for God in his kingdom.  However, late in his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a philosophical wake-up call. Overnight, he went from mighty king to wandering madman, as he was stricken with a psycho-mania, which caused him to act like an animal. He grew long hair and nails, roaming about the countryside grazing on grass.  Seven years into his malady, Nebuchadnezzar returned to his senses; immediately, he knew his lifelong mistake. A once Godless ruler was now a God-fearing man. In fact, his own philosophical journey was recorded in the ancient texts of the prophet Daniel, who was living as a captive in Babylon:  "I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked to heaven. I was given my mind back and I blessed the High God, thanking and glorifying God, who lives forever.  "At the same time that I was given back my mind, I was also given back my majesty and splendor, making my kingdom shine. All the leaders and important people came looking for me. I was reestablished as king in my kingdom and became greater than ever. And that\'s why I\'m singing -- I, Nebuchadnezzar -- singing and praising the King of Heaven:  "Everything he does is right, and he does it the right way. He knows how to turn a proud person into a humble man."  Nebuchadnezzar was a mighty king, ruling a vast kingdom. By the world\'s standards, he was the most powerful man of his day. However, through a season of humbling, Nebuchadnezzar came to recognize that God is a far mightier king, ruling a kingdom that is everlasting.

Category  Nebuchadnezzar - Indiana Jones Wiki - WikiaNebuchadnezzar | Indiana Jones Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Edit  The Babylonians worshipped\xa0 Marduk , the ruler of a dimension called the Aetherium . According to ancient passages discovered by Indiana Jones , Marduk inspired King Nebuchadnezzar through writing, urging him to build a " great engine "\xa0in order to physically contact Marduk \'s\xa0own, otherworldly realm. Following this, the scripture becomes unclear: "Having no understanding, the rabble hath thrown down his work." It is therefore uncertain whether the masses abandoned the machine in accord with Nebuchadnezzar\'s orders or against Nebuchadnezzar\'s orders; much of the controversy regards whether the phrase "his work" refers to the work of Nebuchadnezzar or Marduk. However, it is known that four "trusted" Disciples of Marduk , named\xa0 Urgon , Taklit , Nub , Azerim , each fled from Babylon with essential pieces of the Machine and created or summoned minions and one great Guardian to guard over these parts after they had died.  Legacy  During his excavations of Babylon between 1899 — 1917 , Robert Koldeway discovered Nebuchadnezzar\'s palace as well as the Temple of Marduk . [1]  Behind the scenes  There were four Babylonian kings named Nebuchadnezzar:  The first ruled the Babylonian Empire in the 1100s BC.  The second (605-562 BC) was the Babylonian ruler mentioned in the biblical Book of Daniel, and built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and conquered Aram and Judah  The third and fourth rebelled against Darius I of Persia in 522 and 521 BC  It is not clear which | Question: Nebuchadnezzar was the ruler of which ancient kingdom (606-562 BC)?', ['ancient babylon', 'babylon'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6207'), ('Context: The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills was a private nursing home located in Hollywood , Florida , United States with 152 beds .

It is dynastically sort of a continuation to Cenél nGabráin of Dál Riata, "race of Fergus", as "house" an originally Celtic concept to express one of the two rivalling leader clans of early medieval Scotland, whose founding father is king Fergus Mor of Dalriada. This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cenél nGabráin were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld.  Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cenél Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc.  Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan\'s son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.  Domnall III, r. 1093-1094 and 1094-1097  Donnchad II, r. 1094  William I (William the Lion), r.1165-1214  Alexander II, r.1214-1249  House of StuartThe House of Stuart, originally Stewart and, in Gaelic, Stiubhard is a European royal house that originated in Scotland. The dynasty\'s patrilineal Breton ancestors had held the office of High Steward of Scotland since the 12th century, after arriving by way of Norman England. The royal Stewart line was founded by Robert II, and they were Kings and Queens of Scots from the late 14th century through the union with England in 1707.  Mary I, Queen of Scots was brought up in France, where she adopted the French spelling of the name, Stuart.  Her son, James VI of Scotland, inherited the thrones of England and Ireland upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603.  Except for the period of the Commonwealth, 1649-1660, the Stuarts were monarchs of England, Scotland and Ireland until 1707; then of Great Britain and Ireland, to the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. James VI of Scotland then inherited the realms of Elizabeth I of England, becoming James\xa0I of England and Ireland in the Union of the Crowns. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688, two Stuart queens ruled the isles: Mary II and Anne. Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife.  Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who would brought up a Roman Catholic and would precede his half-sisters; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters.  But neither had any children who survived to adulthood, so under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704, the crown passed to the House of Hanover on the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, to the midpoint of the Early modern period. Monarchs such as James IV were known for sponsoring exponents of the Northern Renaissance such as the poet Robert Henryson, and others.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea on the northwest , the Ionian Sea on the southwest , the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea on the south and southeast , and the Black Sea on the east and northeast .

Constructed by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) , starting on 13 August 1961 , the Wall cut off ( by land ) West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989 . Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992 . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses .

In the initial episodes of the first season , Carrie 's apartment is seen to be above a coffee shop somewhere near the vicinity of Madison Avenue . By approximately the fourth episode , the usual facade of a series of brownstones adjacent to hers is adopted , and remains that way throughout the series .

Filtration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive : it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure . About one - fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries ; four - fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries . Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day : 99 % of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed . Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive , due to diffusion , or active , due to pumping against a concentration gradient . Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active . Substances reabsorbed include : water , sodium , chloride , glucose , amino acids , lactate , magnesium , calcium , phosphate , uric acid , and bicarbonate . Substances secreted include urea , creatinine , potassium , hydrogen , and uric acid . Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate , and thereby maintain homeostasis , include ( along with the substance affected ) antidiuretic hormone ( water ) , aldosterone ( sodium , potassium ) , parathyroid hormone ( calcium , phosphate ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) .

Silver Screen Collection/Moviepix/Getty Images  "St. Elmo\'s Fire," the coming-of-age story that made for a seminal Brat Pack movie, was released exactly 30 years ago today!  With its killer John Parr theme song \xa0and its cast of glamorous young stars on the rise, it became a must-see for Generation X. The Joel Schumacher-directed film made over $37 million at the box office, making it the twenty-third highest-grossing movie of 1985.  [Cred: Columbia Pictures]  The Brat Pack never again appeared in such large numbers together (no movie featured more than two at a time after "St. Elmo\'s Fire"), but here they all are, together again, as we take a look at what they\'ve been up to (and how they\'re holding up):  [Cred: Moviepix/Getty Images and Venturelli/Getty Images]  Rob Lowe:\xa0Bad-boy "Billy Hicks" from the movie has gone on to achieve the most successful career, working steadily for the past 30 years. After burning up the screen as a heartthrob in "The Outsiders" (1983), "Class" (1983), "The Hotel New Hampshire" (1984), "Oxford Blues" (1984), "Youngblood" (1986), and "...About Last Night" (1986), among many others, he repositioned himself with the edgy thriller "Bad Influence" (1990). He had a career resurgence after playing for laughs in the three "Austin Powers" movies (1997—2002). Most recently, he scored with a memorable featured role in the Liberace biopic "Behind the Candelabra" (2013), and as a series regular on "Parks and Recreation" (2010—2015). It could\xa0literally\xa0be said he\'s aged well, except he doesn\'t seem to have aged at all.

Jane" (1997). Since then, 52-year-old Moore has made fewer films and more of a tabloid splash thanks to her marriages to and divorces from Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher. One of her daughters with Willis, Rumer, was just rewarded for her fancy footwork on "Dancing with the Stars."  Emilio Estevez: "Kirby Keger" from the film, Estevez dated Moore in real life, and earned his claim to fame in "The Mighty Ducks" (1992). Now 53, he is not only a respected actor, writer, and director (most notably of the star-studded 2006 Bobby Kennedy biopic "Bobby"), he\'s also known for being the brother of TV bad boy Charlie Sheen and son of acting legend Martin Sheen.

Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. About 0.9% of the Sun's mass is oxygen. Oxygen constitutes 49.2% of the Earth's crust by mass and is the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass). Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth's atmosphere, taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some 1015 tonnes).[d] Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: Mars (with 0.1% O2 by volume) and Venus have far lower concentrations.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected.

This is a translation of the Latin phrase dies Solis . English , like most of the Germanic languages , preserves the original pagan / sun associations of the day . Many other European languages , including all of the Romance languages , have changed its name to the equivalent of `` the Lord 's day '' ( based on Ecclesiastical Latin dies Dominica ) . In both West Germanic and North Germanic mythology the Sun is personified as Sunna / Sól .   Monday : Old English Mōnandæg ( pronounced ( ˈmoːnɑndæj ) ) , meaning `` Moon 's day '' . This is equivalent to the Latin name dies lunae . In North Germanic mythology , the Moon is personified as Máni .   Tuesday : Old English Tīwesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈtiːwezdæj ) ) , meaning `` Tiw 's day '' . Tiw ( Norse Týr ) was a one - handed god associated with single combat and pledges in Norse mythology and also attested prominently in wider Germanic paganism . The name of the day is also related to the Latin name dies Martis , `` Day of Mars '' .   Wednesday : Old English Wōdnesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈwoːdnezdæj ) ) meaning the day of the Germanic god Woden ( known as Óðinn among the North Germanic peoples ) , and a prominent god of the Anglo - Saxons ( and other Germanic peoples ) in England until about the seventh century . It is also vaguely related to the Latin counterpartdies Mercurii , `` Day of Mercury '' . The connection between Mercury and Odin is more strained than the other syncretic connections . The usual explanation is that both Wodan and Mercury were considered psychopomps , or guides of souls after death , in their respective mythologies ; both are also associated with poetic and musical inspiration . The Icelandic Miðviku , German Mittwoch , Low German Middeweek and Finnish keskiviikko all mean mid-week .   Thursday : Old English Þūnresdæg ( pronounced ( ˈθuːnrezdæj ) ) , meaning ' Þunor 's day ' . Þunor means thunder or its personification , the Norse god known in Modern English as Thor . Similarly Dutch donderdag , German Donnerstag ( ' thunder 's day ' ) , Finnish torstai , and Scandinavian Torsdag ( ' Thor 's day ' ) . Thor 's day corresponds to Latin dies Iovis , `` day of Jupiter '' .   Friday : Old English Frīgedæg ( pronounced ( ˈfriːjedæj ) ) , meaning the day of the Anglo - Saxon goddess Fríge . The Norse name for the planet Venus was Friggjarstjarna , ' Frigg 's star ' . It is based on the Latin dies Veneris , `` Day of Venus '' .   Saturday : the only day of the week to retain its Roman origin in English , named after the Roman god Saturn associated with the Titan Cronus , father of Zeus and many Olympians . Its original Anglo - Saxon rendering was Sæturnesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈsæturnezdæj ) ) . In Latin , it was dies Saturni , `` Day of Saturn '' . The Scandinavian Lørdag / Lördag deviates significantly as it has no reference to either the Norse or the Roman pantheon ; it derives from old Norse laugardagr , literally `` washing - day '' . The German Sonnabend ( mainly used in northern and eastern Germany ) and the Low German words Sünnavend mean `` Sunday Eve '' , the German word Samstag ( mainly used in southern and western Germany ) derives from the name for Shabbat . | Question: where did the days of the week originate from ?", ['Tiw', "Þunor 's day", "sun 's day", 'Latin name dies lunae', 'Latin phrase dies Solis', 'Day of Saturn', 'Roman god Saturn', "Tiw 's day", "Moon 's day", 'Thor', 'Óðinn', 'Fríge'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-54223'), ("Context: The Statue of Liberty is a figure of a robed woman representing Libertas , a Roman liberty goddess .

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria\'s approach was           significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte           Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste           Libeault of the Nancy           School . Faria\'s theoretical position, and the subsequent           experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant           contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of mile           Cou and the autogenic training techniques of Johannes           Heinrich Schultz .  Reichenbach  Rcamier, in 1821, prior to the           development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used           something resembling hypnoanesthesia and operated on patients under mesmeric coma.  In the 1840s and 1850s , Carl           Reichenbach began experiments to find any scientific validity to "mesmeric" energy, which he termed Odic           force after the Norse god Odin.

Also under Clause 2 , the manner for choosing electors is determined by each state legislature , not directly by the federal government . Many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly , but over time all of them switched to using the popular vote to help determine electors , which persists today . Once chosen , electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the plurality in their state , but at least 21 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior ; those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as `` faithless '' or `` unpledged electors '' .

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

This renewal of hostilities in the Arab–Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices. At the time, Iran was the world\'s second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally. Weeks later, the Shah of Iran said in an interview: "Of course [the price of oil] is going to rise... Certainly! And how!... You\'ve [Western nations] increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement...

The name was inspired by a combination of the team 's elevated location in Upper Manhattan , and to the noted Scottish military unit The Gordon Highlanders , which coincided with the team 's president Joseph Gordon whose family was of Scots Irish heritage .

A major factor in this rejection of the tradition of Mosaic authorship was the development of the documentary hypothesis , which understood the Pentateuch as a composite work made up of four `` sources , '' or documents , compiled over centuries in a process that was not concluded until long after Moses ' death . The documentary hypothesis aroused understandable opposition from traditional scholars . One of the most significant was David Zvi Hoffmann ( 1843 - 1921 ) , who attempted to defend Mosaic authorship by demonstrating that the sources identified by the documentary hypothesis were , in fact , pre-exilic ; if this were proven , he believed , then the hypothesis itself was dis - proven . The most he would concede to the proponents of the hypothesis was that Moses may have written various scrolls over his career and that these may have been collated and united before his death . Another important Jewish scholar , and one still active , is David Weiss Halivni ( b. 1927 ) : he has developed a theory of Chate'u Yisrael , literally , `` Israel has sinned '' , which states that the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours and neglected the Torah of Moses , with the result that it became `` blemished and maculated ; '' only on the return from Babylon did the people once again accept the Torah , which was then recompiled and edited by Ezra as evidenced in Ezra -- Nehemiah and Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah . He further states that while the text of the Torah was corrupted , oral tradition was preserved intact , which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details . Menachem Mendel Kasher ( 1895 - 1983 ) , taking a different approach , accepted the documentary hypothesis but adapted it to the Mosaic tradition , pointing to certain traditions of the Oral Torah which show Moses quoting Genesis prior to the epiphany at Sinai ; based on a number of Bible verses and rabbinic statements , he therefore suggested that Moses made use of documents authored by the Patriarchs when redacting that book .

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand. It sits behind a goal, with the family stand to the right, main stand to the left, and the kop directly opposite.

M*A*S*H character  Vital information  Captain (O-3), U.S. Army Reserve  Job/Role in unit:  Fred Williamson , film. Timothy Brown , television series  Oliver Harmon "Spearchucker" Jones was a surgeon who appears in the MASH novel by Richard Hooker , the MASH movie and also in the M*A*S*H television series. He was portrayed by Fred Williamson in the movie and by Timothy Brown \xa0, who also\xa0played the part of corpsman Corporal Judson in the film.  In the television series Spearchucker appears in six episodes during the early part of Season 1 of the series and was one of the original Swampmen, along with Trapper, Hawkeye, and Frank Burns, but the character was dropped from the series after 6 appearances.  Contents  Edit  In the MASH novel, the Spearchucker character appears in Chapter 12. Here his full name is given as Oliver Wendell "Spearchucker" Jones. To deal with boredom, Hawkeye, Trapper and Duke Forrest discuss putting together a football team. Hawkeye suggests bringing Spearchucker into the team.  Hawkeye had roomed with Spearchucker at the 72nd Evac Hospital and had found out that besides being a neurosurgeon, Spearchucker had played football during medical school to earn some extra money and had been signed up by the Philadelphia Eagles. However very few people knew about this.  So they persuade Henry to request for a neurosurgeon, specifically Spearchucker, for the 4077th as a ringer for their football team. Spearchucker helps prepare the team and eventually plays a key role in strategizing their victory over the 72nd Evac hospital.  In the book, just like in the movie, Spearchucker reveals that the nickname "Spearchucker", ordinarily a racial slur, referred in this case to his javelin-throwing prowess.  Spearchucker in the MASH movie  Edit  In the MASH movie, Spearchucker\'s full name becomes Oliver Harmon Jones. The original screenplay lists his backstory much as it was given in the novel. However in the movie dialogue, this is covered much more briefly, and he is described as playing for the 49ers not the Eagles. His role in the football game is the same as described in the book.  The film also depicts Spearchucker as a particularly skilled neurosurgeon and this, together with the experience of playing football together, helps Duke Forrest overcome his racial prejudices and the two become friends at the end, shaking hands when it is time for Duke to go back stateside.  Fred Williamson (in scene with Hawkeye Pierce ( Donald Sutherland )) played Spearchucker Jones in the 1970 MASH film  Spearchucker in the M*A*S*H TV series  Edit  Timothy Brown who portrayed Spearchucker in the TV series had been a professional football player. Perhaps there had been an intention to pursue the football theme in the M*A*S*H episodes but in the end not much is made of this. Spearchucker is only seen playing football once, with Radar, Boone and a few others at the beginning of the "Pilot" episode. He later attends the raffle party with Ginger (he\'s the one in the Samurai helmet).  In "Chief Surgeon Who" , we are reminded that he is a neurosurgeon when he tells Hawkeye in the O.R.: "outside of the brain I\'m dead". Hawkeye gives him advice on how to deal with a pancreatic injury which contradicts Franks, much to Frank\'s annoyance. Later, when General Barker is searching the camp for Henry, he stumbles into a tent when Spearchucker is playing strip dominoes with Ginger.  In "The Moose" , Spearchucker has his most significant role. Here he helps Hawkeye and Trapper "demoosify" Young Hi and teach her independence and self-confidence. He tells her that when she meets people, she must not look down. She must look them in the eye and not back off.

I’m sure you’re all familiar with it by now, but if not, BendGate was created from an alleged bending issue with Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. There’s a specific weak point on the inside of the chassis right beneath the volume buttons that allows it to bend very easily with pressure added in the right place. To most, it may seem like a non-issue, but a single video sparked one of the biggest viral moments this year in tech…  Lewis Hilsenteger from Unbox Therapy published the video that I’ve embedded below this article and that’s when it all got worse. In the video, Hilsenteger clearly bends an iPhone 6 Plus on camera and notes the specific weak point mentioned above. Of course, Hilsenteger (who is a friend and music collaborator ) had absolutely no idea that his video would cause the Internet to implode, but he assumed it would gain a decent amount of traction based on reports of the iPhone 6 Plus’ bendable properties that had been published earlier that day. 45 million views later, BendGate became a PR nightmare for Apple, somewhat of a conspiracy theory (which Hilsenteger debunked ), and a chance for mainstream media to show its true colors…  First off, let’s get one thing straight: The iPhone 6 Plus will bend if enough pressure is applied to a certain area. In fact, a lot of phones will bend when extreme pressure is applied. Everything has a weak point.

And there is more…  Iceland is one of the Nordic countries and part of Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden).  Reykjavík is the capital city of the Republic of Iceland.  Hvannadalshnukur (2,119m) is the highest point in Iceland.  Vatnajokull glacier in Southeast Iceland is Europe’s largest glacier.  Hekla is Iceland\'s most active volcano; Hekla is also a common female name in Iceland.  In 1963 a new volcano appeared in the Atlantic close to Iceland. It grew to become an island now called Surtsey.  The English word "geyser" comes from Iceland\'s Great Geysir in Haukadalur.  The phenomenon of the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) can be seen during mid-winter (November-December) when the weather is clear.  The "Althingi", the Icelandic parliament, dates back to the early tenth century.  The last name of Icelanders is derived from their father\'s first name.  In the telephone book everyone is listed by their first name.  In the last quarter of the nineteenth century twenty percent of Iceland\'s population emigrated to Canada and the USA.  In the 1960s and 70s there was a dispute between Iceland and the UK over fishing grounds, known as the "Cod Wars".  The population of Iceland reached 300,000 in the year 2006.  Soccer is Iceland’s favourite team game.  Icelandic, the language, belongs to the Germanic language family that includes German, Dutch and all the Nordic languages except Finnish. Its closest \'living relative\' is Faroese - both are derived from Old Norse.  Iceland, Not so quick (but still fun) facts!  Supernatural Iceland  Elves, trolls and ghosts  Surveys show that despite their obsession with modern technology, as many as 80% of Icelanders believe in the existence of elves. Even today, roads have been rerouted and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.  All around the country, strange lava formations were once explained in folktales as trolls who were turned to stone when caught outdoors in daylight. But only children in Iceland believe in trolls today, and the once widespread belief in ghosts is in decline, some say because electricity has taken the fright out of the long winter nights.  A different kind of fauna  Contrary to what many people think, there are no polar bears in Iceland. Admittedly, every ten years or so a polar bear may arrive as an accidental tourist on an ice flow from Greenland, However, they aren\'t invited to stay. The Arctic fox is the only native mammal. Reindeer live in the wild in east Iceland, but were only imported in the 18th century. Mink have also adapted to the wild, the descendants of animals which escaped from fur farms in the 1930s. A number of pedigree animal stocks are only found in Iceland. Many of these rare breeds have disappeared elsewhere and are the original decedents brought over by the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, cow, sheep and sheepdog. Marine mammals are also found in abundance along the coasts, especially minke whale, humpback whale, fin whale and several species of seals. Some whale watching tour operators claim 98% success rates for sightings.

His breakthrough came in 1982 when he co-wrote and co-starred in BBC Television’s The Young Ones, a situation comedy featuring a group of revolting students on the breadline, squeezing spots, baring bottoms and sharing a filthy flat.  Arms flailing and eyes bulging, Mayall’s character, the angst-ridden loud-mouthed student Rick, chimed with the programme’s unpredictable “alternative” quality. The show tore up the established rules of comedy; the resulting 35 minutes of rampaging, violent slapstick struck some as having more in common with Warner Bros cartoons than with traditional sitcoms.  Related Articles  22 Jan 2009  Mayall in The Young Ones with Adrian Edmonson, Nigel Planer and Christopher Ryan (BBC)  Mayall wrote The Young Ones with his then girlfriend Lise Meyer and another emerging alternative comedy star Ben Elton. Although it found a cult audience straight away — mostly students, teenagers and twentysomethings — others were slow to catch on and it was only when the series was repeated that it began to build a sizeable audience.  In contrast to his outrageous, rebarbative characterisations, Mayall was quietly-spoken and shy, with a reputation as the chameleon comedian: “fluent, funny, polite, informed” noted one of the comparatively few interviewers he spoke to, but “also evasive, slippery, canny, cautious and a tad self-congratulatory”.  “There’s a quality about me,” Mayall himself once confessed, “that you don’t quite trust”.  Although he became a defining part of the television landscape of the 1980s — including a memorable turn as the rumbustiously randy Squadron Commander Flashheart in Blackadder Goes Forth (“Always treat your kite like you treat your woman ... get inside her five times a day and take her to heaven and back!”) — Mayall always preferred working in the live theatre. His fellow comic actor Simon Fanshawe ascribed to Mayall “a kind of pure energy as a solo performer on stage that, if you are prepared for the ride, is irresistible”.  In April 1998, when he was 40, a near-fatal accident on a quad bike left Mayall in a coma for five days; severe head injuries caused impaired memory, shaky co-ordination and speech problems. “The accident was over Easter and as you know, Jesus our Lord was nailed to the cross on Good Friday,” recounted Mayall in an interview last year. “The day before that is Crap Thursday, and that’s the day Rik Mayall died. And then he was dead on Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday until Bank Holiday Monday.”  But he appeared to have made a complete recovery, and returned to work in blustering form as Richie Twat (pronounced Thwaite) in Guesthouse Paradiso (1999), a film he co-wrote with his friend and long-time comedy partner Adrian Edmondson.  Although his part as Peeves the poltergeist in the first Harry Potter film failed to make the final cut, Mayall remained philosophical. “I’ve looked over the edge,” he remarked, adding that his brush with death had taught him that ending up on the cutting room floor hardly seemed so bad.

It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids,  which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think  that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol\'s  most important job is to help the body respond to stress. Among its other  vital tasks, cortisol:  helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function;  helps slow the immune system\'s inflammatory response;  helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for  energy; and  helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced  by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol  is regulated by the brain\'s hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, a  bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. (Source: excerpt from Addison\'s Disease: NIDDK )  Summary Information: Adrenal glands  Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are a pair of endocrine glands, one located on the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, chemical substances that help to regulate a wide variety of the body\'s processes. The adrenal glands and the hormones they produce play a big role in such processes as metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, sexual development and function, the immune system, and the stress response.  The adrenal glands include two regions, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla, which each produce different hormones. Adrenal hormones include the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal steroid hormones: adrenal androgen hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids. Conditions that can afflict the adrenal glands include Addison\'s disease, Cushing\'s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal tumors, adrenal cancer, and trauma.

They are located immediately anterior to the kidneys, and are encased in a connective tissue                         capsule that is usually partially                         buried in an island of fat. The adrenal glands lie beneath                         the peritoneum (that is, they are "retroperitoneal").  * In some circumstances (e.g. in the cases of certain types of tumours), one or more of the adrenal glands may be surgically removed. For further information about this see: http://www.endocrineweb.com/adrenal.html (Norman Endocrine Surgery Clinic).  The Structure of the Adrenal Glands:  The most obvious aspect of the structure of the                          adrenal glands is their partitioning                          into two distinctive components:                          the paler medulla (centre), and                          the darker cortex (surround). Both of these tissues contain many blood vessels ,                         hence they may be described as "richly vascularized".  Adrenal Medulla  The medulla consists of many large columnar cells                            called "chromaffin cells". These synthesize and secrete catecholamines.  There are also some Ganglion cells                            are also observed. Blood from throughout                           the adrenal gland collects into large medullary veins to exit                           the gland.

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies. Skylab was 30.2 metres (99 feet) in length and 6.7 metres (22 feet) in diameter and had a mass of about 75,000 kg (165,000 pounds). Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research. Its main scientific instrument, the Apollo Telescope Mount , incorporated a number of component telescopes and other devices for observing the Sun over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum , from visible light through X-rays .

Skylab hosted two additional three-man crews for missions lasting 59 and 84 days. Each of the three Skylab missions set a new space endurance record. Although plans called for Skylab to be used again with one of the first space shuttle missions boosting it to a higher orbit, increased solar activity caused its orbit to degrade faster than expected.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK).

It starred Tony Hancock, with Sid James; the radio version co-starring Hattie Jacques, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams.  Kenneth Williams - Tony Hancock - Bill Kerr - Sid James  The series was written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson and produced by Dennis Main Wilson for most of its run. After Main Wilson departed for his television career, his role was taken by Tom Ronald. The distinctive tuba-based theme tune was composed by Wally Stott.  Comedian Tony Hancock starred in the show, playing an exaggerated and much poorer version of his own character and lifestyle, as a down-at-heel comedian living at the dilapidated 23 Railway Cuttings in East Cheam.  The comedy actor Sid James played a criminally-inclined confidant of Hancock, who usually succeeded in conning him each week; Bill Kerr appeared as Hancock’s Australian lodger, a character who became noticeably dim-witted in the later shows. A young Kenneth Williams, taking his first job in comedy, provided the funny voices for all the minor characters in the show each week. Moira Lister appeared in the first series, before being replaced by Andrée Melly for the next two; both women played love interest for Hancock’s character, in essentially ‘straight’ roles. In the fourth and fifth series a comedienne, Hattie Jacques, provided comedy in the female role as the harridan Grizelda Pugh, who was Hancock’s secretary and Sid’s occasional girlfriend. By this time, Hancock’s difficulties with women had become part of the characterisation.  Tony Hancock  The series broke with the variety tradition which was then dominant in British radio comedy, highlighting a new genre: the sitcom or situation comedy.  Commissioning of series in the UK were then closer to the American practice with extensive runs not unknown, but in this case, with only two writers. Continuity in the idiom was yet to develop, and details changed to suit each episode. The domestic situation varied, but Hancock usually portrayed a ‘resting’ or hopeless down-at-heel actor and/or comedian (though some episodes showed him having runs of success, while some episodes depict him pursuing professional careers as fantasies), James was always on-the-fiddle in some way, Kerr gradually became dim and virtually unemployable (although he had started out as a fast-talking American-style Australian), and Hancock’s ‘secretary’, Miss Pugh, had such a loose job description that in one celebrated episode she had cooked the Sunday lunch.  Hattie Jaques  Hancock’s character had various addresses, but by the third radio series he had arrived at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam. Sometimes this was portrayed as a council house, but occasionally there was a private landlord. In a few early episodes Hancock owned the house, and later this became the norm. The house changed to accommodate the cast: in some episodes it appeared to be a two-bedroom terraced house, with Kerr as Hancock’s lodger; but in series four and five it had at least three bedrooms, as Miss Pugh was also resident in some episodes. In others she ‘came round’ each day, presumably from her own domicile. Railway Cuttings and East Cheam were fictitious, but Cheam is a real town in Surrey, located to the west of Sutton.  Sid James & Tony Hancock  Most of the radio episodes were recorded between one day and three weeks in advance of broadcast, except for Series 6 which was mostly recorded during a three-week period in June 1959 in order to avoid clashing with the recording of Series 5 of the television show.  It should be noted that Galton and Simpson never gave any of their Hancock scripts, for Radio or Television, titles, this was usually left to the girl who filed the scripts at their office, she gave them names that were a reminder of what the script was about, so when Roger Wilmut came to write his book ‘Tony Hancock | Question: Who played Miss Pugh on the Hancock radio show?", ['hattie jacques'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1698'), ("Context: During Microsoft 's E3 2017 press conference on June 11 , 2017 , Microsoft announced that roughly 50 % of Xbox One users had played an Xbox 360 game on Xbox One through the system 's backward - compatibility feature .

He first appeared in The Crab with the Golden Claws and had been in every Tintin \xa0book since then.\xa0  Contents  [ show ]  History  Captain Haddock sailed over twenty years with his old friend, Captain Chester , before becoming commander of the Karaboudjan where his alcoholism was taken advantage of by his crooked first mate Allan Thompson . Tintin rescued him from the ship and the two friends were barely ever parted again. He is a direct descendant of the 17th century seafarer Sir Francis Haddock , a sea captain under Charles II. He was the captain for two expeditions during his adventures with Tintin, commanding the Aurora in The Shooting Star during the expedition to find the meteorite and the Sirius , Captain Chester\'s ship that he lent to Haddock to find Red Rackham\'s treasure. At the end of the latter adventure, Haddock acquired with the proceeds of the sale of his friend Cuthbert Calculus \' patent for the Shark-proof submarine , Marlinspike Hall , which once belonged to Captain Haddock\'s ancestor Francis. Haddock retired from sailing there and invited Tintin and Calculus to indefinitely live there with him.  Name  As for the origin of the name of Captain Haddock\'s name, who first appeared in Hergé \'s notes in 1938 , according to Philippe Goddin ,\xa0author of Chronology of a work, it is inspired by Captain Craddock, Franco-German film Hanns Schwarz and Max Vaucorbeil (1931), of which Hergé was a big fan. In the original french version of The Crab with the Golden Claws, Captain Haddock even sings a song in the film: Guys navy. However, according to the first wife of Hergé, Germaine Kiekens , the name "Haddock" comes from the English fish dish, the smoked haddock. However, the name Haddock is a real surname in English, examples such as Sir Richard Haddock (1629-1715) ordered the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay. His second son, Nicholas Haddock followed the career of his father. In addition, Herbert James Haddock (1861-1946) was commander of the White Star Line and the Titanic among others in the technical tests before delivery to the transatlantic company, and then the sister ship of the Titanic, the Olympic.  Drunkness  Captain Haddock was a drunkard, Which is one of his weaknesses. He hates drinking anything that doesn´t contain alcohol, like water. He did make attampts to shake this habit, even becoming the president of the Society of Sober Sailors , a seafarers equivalent to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, when Professor Calculus invented the pills to make consumption of alcohol unpleasant in Tintin and the Picaros , this weakness was gone.

This author uses an example of the contractile elements present in the porifera or sponges that do truly lack this striated muscle containing this protein . Furthermore , Steinmetz et al. present evidence for a polyphyletic origin of striated muscle cell development through their analysis of morphological and molecular markers that are present in bilaterians and absent in cnidarians , ctenophores , and bilaterians . Steimetz et al. showed that the traditional morphological and regulatory markers such as actin , the ability to couple myosin side chains phosphorylation to higher concentrations of the positive concentrations of calcium , and other MyHC elements are present in all metazoans not just the organisms that have been shown to have muscle cells . Thus , the usage of any of these structural or regulatory elements in determining whether or not the muscle cells of the cnidarians and ctenophores are similar enough to the muscle cells of the bilaterians to confirm a single lineage is questionable according to Steinmetz et al. Furthermore , Steinmetz et al. explain that the orthologues of the MyHc genes that have been used to hypothesize the origin of striated muscle occurred through a gene duplication event that predates the first true muscle cells ( meaning striated muscle ) , and they show that the MyHc genes are present in the sponges that have contractile elements but no true muscle cells . Furthermore , Steinmetz et all showed that the localization of this duplicated set of genes that serve both the function of facilitating the formation of striated muscle genes and cell regulation and movement genes were already separated into striated myhc and non-muscle myhc . This separation of the duplicated set of genes is shown through the localization of the striated myhc to the contractile vacuole in sponges while the non-muscle myhc was more diffusely expressed during developmental cell shape and change . Steinmetz et al. found a similar pattern of localization in cnidarians with except with the cnidarian N. vectensis having this striated muscle marker present in the smooth muscle of the digestive track . Thus , Steinmetz et al. argue that the pleisiomorphic trait of the separated orthologues of myhc can not be used to determine the monophylogeny of muscle , and additionally argue that the presence of a striated muscle marker in the smooth muscle of this cnidarian shows a fundamentally different mechanism of muscle cell development and structure in cnidarians . | Question: what type of muscle is the digestive system ?', ['smooth'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-72409'), ("Context: `` Archie Marries Veronica / Archie Marries Betty '' is an American comic book story by writer Michael Uslan and artists Stan Goldberg and Bob Smith that was originally presented in Archie # 600 -- 606 .

The basal ganglia are located near the thalamus and hypothalamus . They receive input from the cerebral cortex , which sends outputs to the motor centers in the brain stem . A part of the basal ganglia called the striatum controls posture and movement . Recent studies indicate that , if there is an inadequate supply of dopamine , the striatum is affected , which can lead to visible behavioral symptoms of Parkinson 's disease . | Question: the limbic system is an important part of the brain because it regulates ?", ['the autonomic nervous system', 'the endocrine system'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-28325'), ("Context: Sgt .

E-bikes , which can reach a speed of 32 kilometres per hour , are allowed to share the road with cars , pedestrians and other traffic throughout the province . The new rules limit the maximum weight of an e-bike to 120 kilograms , require a maximum braking distance of nine metres and prohibit any modifications to the bike 's motor that would create speeds greater than 32 kilometres per hour . Also , riders must be at least 16 years of age , wear approved bicycle or motorcycle helmets and follow the same traffic laws as bicyclists . Municipalities will be able to decide where e-bikes may be used on their streets , bike lanes and trails . E-bikes will not be permitted on 400 - series highways , expressways or other areas where bicycles are not allowed . Riding an e-bike under the age of 16 or riding an e-bike without an approved helmet carries fines ranging from $60 to $500 .

Many of the delegates assumed that the purpose of the convention was to discuss and draft improvements to the existing Articles of Confederation and would have abandoned the effort otherwise . The most contentious disputes revolved around composition and election of the upper legislative house in the future bicameral Congress , to be known as the Senate , how `` proportional representation '' was to be defined ( whether to include slaves or other property ) , whether to divide the executive power between three persons or invest the power into a single chief executive to be called the President , how to elect the President , how long his term was to be and whether he could run for reelection , what offenses should be impeachable , the nature of a fugitive slave clause , whether to allow the abolition of the slave trade , and whether judges should be chosen by the legislature or executive . Most of the time during the Convention was spent on deciding these issues , while the powers of legislature , executive , and judiciary were not heavily disputed . Once the Convention began , the delegates first agreed on the principles of the Convention , then they agreed on Madison 's proposed Virginia Plan and began to modify it . A Committee of Detail , assembled during the July 4th recess , eventually produced a rough draft of the constitution . Most of the rough draft remained in place , and can be found in the final version of the constitution . After the final issues were resolved , the Committee on Style produced the final version , and it was voted on by the delegates , inscribed on parchment with engraving for printing and sent to the states and their legislatures . | Question: the constitutional convention created which form of legislature ?", ['bicameral'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-76411')]

Evidence has been dug up that this root plant originated in Afghanistan. Over the centuries traders traveling through the region picked up carrot seeds there and carried them along the trade routes of Arabia, Africa, and Asia, selling them in regions anxious to cultivate new and productive plants. Even in the early days there were many varieties of carrots, coming in an assortment of colors - purple, white, black, and red but, surprisingly, not orange!  Carrots spread over the civilized world and have even been found in Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh\'s tombs. Drawings found in Egyptian temples are thought by Egyptologists to be a purple variety of carrots 1 .  Both the ancient Greeks and the Romans were familiar with carrots, although these early varieties were not the sweet, succulent orange carrots that are grown today. Early carrots were typically not often eaten as food by the Greeks, but were used for medicinal purposes. The Romans were known to have eaten both raw and cooked carrots accompanied with an olive oil dressing containing different herbs. Like many other plants, at various times in ancient societies, carrots were thought to be an aphrodisiac.  Carrots began to be cultivated in Europe by the 13th century (1200s), with many doctors prescribing carrots for medicinal purposes for ailments as varied as syphilis and animal bites! The Medieval Europeans were very much in awe of the ancients and inclined to borrow heavily from them.  Carrots were well-known to 16th century botanists and writers, who described red and purple varieties in France, and yellow and red varieties in England. The Dutch cross-bred the yellow and red carrot to produce a variety that was the emblematic color of the House of Orange. This carrot quickly became popular and was further developed to become the sweet, succulent orange carrot which is the most recognized color of carrot used throughout the world today 2 .  Carrots arrived in Australia in 1788 and became an important food for the colonists. The Carrot Museum reveals that the carrot was introduced to America in 1609. In 1871 America developed its first carrot. It is called the Danvers carrot from its origins in Danvers, MA. However, the carrot did not become popular in the U.S. until after World War I (1914-1918) when "doughboys" returning from the war had been exposed to the carrot in French and other European cuisine. 3  In the Second World War carrots were promoted by the British government and became one of the staple foods in England. People were encouraged grow carrots in their gardens and to cook them in different ways. They were incorporated into both sweet and savory dishes. Growing this crop during troubled times helped people get sufficient amounts of nutritious food to eat in times of food scarcity and rationing.  Red and yellow varieties of carrot are eaten in China and Japan; with the purple carrot becoming increasingly popular in different states in America. There are also \'rainbow\' carrots on the market. However, a single carrot is not multi-colored, the name comes from bags containing red, yellow, purple and orange carrots.

Carrots were also probably White throughout these periods,      often confused with Parsnips (also white).      There was (and still is!) enormous confusion when trying to sort out the individual histories of carrots and parsnips. The Latin name      for the parsnip genus is      thought to come from,      meaning "food".

Olympus Mons is a shield volcano that towers to an amazing 26 km. That makes it 3 times the height of Mt. Everest. Unlike Everest, Olympus Mons has a very gentle slope. It is up to 550 km at its base. The edge of the volcano’s base is marked by a basal cliff that is 6 km high in some places, but has been eradicated by the overflow of lava in the Martian past.  Olympus Mons is the result of many thousands of  basaltic lava flows. The extraordinary size of the volcano has been attributed to the lack of tectonic plate movement on the planet. The lack of movement allows the Martian crust to remain fixed in place over a magma hotspot allowing repeated, large lava flows. Many of these flows have levees along their edges. The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, forming the levees and leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. In images of the volcano you can see partially collapsed lava tubes seen as chains of pit craters. Broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are easily visible as well. Some areas along the volcano’s base show lava flows spilling out into the surrounding plains, forming broad aprons, which are burying the basal escarpment. Crater counts taken by the high resolution images returned by the Mars Express spacecraft in 2004 seem to show that flows on the northwestern flank range in age from 2 million years old to 115 million years old. Since these flows are geologically young, it may indicate that the volcano is still active.  The Olympus Mons caldera complex is made up of at least six overlapping calderas and segments of caldera. Each caldera formed when the roof collapsed following depletion and retreat of the subsurface magma chamber, so each caldera represents a separate eruption. A ‘lake of lava’ seems to have formed the the largest and oldest caldera segment. Using geometric relationships based on caldera dimensions, scientists estimate that the magma chamber associated with this caldera lies about 32 km below the floor of the caldera. Crater size/frequency distributions indicate the calderas range in age from 350 million years ago to about 150 million years ago and may have all formed within 100 million years of each other.  As the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons has been extensively studied. Those studies have been helped by the closeness of Mars. Those studies will continue into the future as will the exploration of the entire planet.  We’ve had many stories about Olympus Mons on Universe Today. Here’s an article about landslides on the side of Olympus Mons , and anther about how Olympus Mons might have been active recently .  Here’s a website all about Olympus Mons, and more information from Exploring Mars.  We have recorded a whole series of podcasts about the Solar System at Astronomy Cast . Check them out here.

Have you even heard of it? Whenever we hear about yogurt, the first thing that comes to mind is the white creamy dairy product that contains live and active cultures. It is often mixed with various kinds of fruits and comes with a sweet taste. But there is also a new type of yogurt that is available today called Greek Yogurt!  So what is Greek yogurt actually? First, Greek yogurt is a yogurt that is increasingly gaining popularity across the country. People love it for its distinctive taste and great health benefits. Greek yogurt is special. It is as thick as sour cream and carries a uniquely tangy flavor, and it contains significantly more protein and less sugar content than a regular yogurt.  Although Greek Yogurt may seem fairly recent, it has in fact been around for thousands of years. Originally known as labneh or strained yogurt, it was a staple in many countries across the Mediterranean region. While the yogurt is popularly named after Greek, Greece isn’t the only country with the culture of making this thick and rich yogurt. The synonymous name of Greek Yogurt is started with Fage, a brand name by a Greek owned company that makes Total Greek Yogurt, which later set the craze in the United States when everyone is passionate about healthy Mediterranean diets.  What Is Greek Yogurt Compared To Regular Yogurt?  While both Greek Yogurt and regular yogurt are made from pasteurized milks, they differ in the way they are processed. Basically, cream from the milk is removed and then bacteria are added to convert the milk lactose into lactic acid. This is how yogurt is made, but to make ‘Greek Style’ yogurt, an additional straining process of removing whey is made. The removal of whey also reduces the amount of carbohydrates as well as sugar content in the yogurt.  Also unlike typical American style yogurt, the milk that is used is made thicker by either boiling off some of the water content, or by adding powdered milk and butter fat to make it more concentrated. This is what makes Greek yogurt creamier and contains higher level of protein and fat.  It usually takes up to 3 pounds of milk to make a single pound of Greek yogurt. This is a reason why Greek Yogurt is more expensive than regular yogurt. It is not even surprising to see Greek yogurt costs up to three times as much.  While generally Greek Yogurt is a healthier choice, you do need to read the label carefully before purchasing one. Since you already know what is Greek yogurt made from, the thicker Greek Yogurt normally contains higher amount of calories and fat than a regular cup of traditional yogurt. But with today’s wide range of choice selections available, you should insist on getting one that is zero-fat or at least a low fat alternative. So you will get to enjoy the best of Greek Yogurt minus the extra calories and fat.

She did not trust in God enough to leave the matter in His hands.  The foundation of the Arab nations.  According to the Koran, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael were ancestors of the Arab nations, and of the prophet Mohammed. The Koran says it was at Mecca that God saved Hagar and her son from death by thirst. Muslim ritual reflects this: every year for thirteen centuries Muslims performing the Hajj have retraced Hagar’s steps as she desperately searched for water.  Hagar represents women in the Bible who are excluded or despised. This might happen because they are childless in a society that valued mothers (as Sarah was at first) or a slave in a hierarchical society (as Hagar was at first).  Mother and beloved child  The story has two episodes:  1 The conception and birth of Hagar’s son Ishmael ( Genesis 16:1-16 ). Hagar was an Egyptian slave girl in the tribe of Abraham. She belonged to Sarah, the alpha female of the tribe. When Sarah could not conceive she gave Hagar to her husband as a surrogate. Hagar became pregnant, and God promised that her child would be the ancestor of a great nation. She bore a son, Ishmael.  2 The expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael ( Genesis 21:1-21 ). Hagar was never fully accepted into the tribe despite being the mother of Abraham’s child, and in the end she was rejected completely and expelled into the desert. But God protected her twice from Sarah’s hatred by sending an angel, and eventually Hagar lived as a free woman, not a slave.  See MAPS OF BIBLE LANDS for the location of this story  Hagar —\xa0victim? or upwardly mobile?  Read Genesis 16:1-16  The story of Hagar took place during the late Bronze Age between 2000 and 1550BC, corresponding to the Middle Kingdom period in Egyptian history.  Hagar was an Egyptian girl who was a slave in the household of Sarah, a Hebrew princess. Sarah may have acquired Hagar as part of the generous bride-price paid to her husband Abraham by Pharaoh in Egypt (this story is in Genesis 12:10-20 ).  Ancient wall painting of beautiful Egyptian women  It was an accepted practice at the time to give servants and slaves as part of the dowry of a wealthy young woman. If Hagar was a gift from Pharaoh, she was probably an accomplished servant with valuable skills. Becoming the servant of a nomadic tribeswoman may have been a step down socially for her.  You might take a look at Egyptian love poems in Women in the Bible: the story of Potiphar’s Wife: it will give you some idea of the comparative sophistication of the Egyptians.  Hagar was always disadvantaged among the Hebrew women because she was a foreigner and a slave. This was ironic, since she came from a land that was socially and politically advanced and possessed cities, temples and elaborate burial sites.

Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

If you like, skip Scotland\'s                  stone age, and click down to bronze age , iron age (the Celts), Roman                  Britain (the Picts), or Dalriada (early                  Scottish history).  Stone Age in Ancient Scotland  Archeology is a fascinating field of study. You get to spend your life holding,                  for instance, a small carved stone ball up to the light while                  saying "What in the world did they use this for?" The                  two favorite words of archeologists? probably. possibly.  Probably farming began to take hold in ancient Scotland around 4000 BC.                  Possibly the carved stone balls were used for a game. In the east,                  people were buried in large barrows (called cairns when made with                  stones). In the west, they used chambered cairns (everyone got                  their own spot). Later, possibly, these two cultures merged under                  the new technologies, greater population, and increased trade of the Bronze Age.  Archeologists do magnificent work, bringing the past to light, but must walk                  a fine line between assuming ancient peoples thought exactly the                  way we do with very similar motivations and interests, or conversely                  lived in a world of such deep superstition and barbarity that                  we should be unable to relate to their concerns and activities                  in any way. It\'s a tough task. Once in a while, archeologists                  are rewarded with a very well-preserved site, such as Skara Brae                  in the Orkneys.  Undercovered by a storm in 1850, the village of Skara Brae survived under sand                  for 5000 years almost completely intact. Why? Because virtually                  everything was made of stone - houses, beds, dressers and shelves                  - even wall recesses with drains beneath, suggesting indoor facilities.                  They had to use stone, since Orkney has few trees.  Other sites, similar to Skara Brae, suggest that the Orkney tribes were                  totem-based. At Cuween Hill, many dog skulls have been found,                  while the Ibister were people of the eagle.  These were the early years of the great henges and stone circles, though                  most were built during the Bronze Age, including some of the largest                  such as Stone Henge. What is a henge? Henges include the circles                  of stone, but are surrounded by a ditch, with the earth dug up                  and piled around the outer perimeter of the ditch, encircling and protecting the stone and timber arrangements inside.  There is a great deal of speculation about the uses of the circles.                  Many included altars and burials. Some seem oriented toward the                  sun and some toward the moon. It would seem they may have been                  used for a variety of purposes depending on the time, place and                  current culture. Popular imagination peoples the henges with druids,                  but the circles of stone predate the druids by many, many centuries.  Bronze Age in Ancient Scotland  Archeologists believe that new people, called the Beaker people after their                  most common archealogical product, moved to the Isles around 2500                  BC bringing their metalworking skills and culture with them. This                  was a peaceful influx, a more technologically advanced society                  influencing and dominating the less advanced. However, the Beaker                  people embraced wholeheartedly the notion of stone circles and                  they are the ones who perfected the art. So cultural exchange                  worked both ways.  Scottish culture changed dramatically with the advent of metalworking.                  Learning to smelt gold and copper, and later to combine copper                  and tin into sturdy bronze, opened broad new vistas in trade,                  the arts, accumulation of wealth, and warfare. All of these produced                  commensurate changes in class structure and ancient society.

He is a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment, as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film, Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he starred as troubled teenager Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his stardom were loner Cal Trask in East of Eden (1955) and surly ranch hand Jett Rink in Giant (1956). Dean's enduring fame and popularity rest on his performances in only these three films, all leading roles.

For 50 years, since his death in a car crash on September 30, 1955, Dean has been portrayed as a daredevil driver whose speeding and recklessness on the road caused his own death.  Now, new evidence has emerged proving that not only was Dean driving safely, but at a much lower speed than was believed at the time.  What type of visitor are you?  At 5:45 PM on September 30, 1955, 24-year-old actor James Dean is killed in Cholame, California, when the Porsche he is driving hits a Ford Tudor sedan at an intersection.   The driver of the other car, 23-year-old California Polytechnic State University student Donald Turnupseed, was dazed but mostly uninjured; Dean’s passenger, German Porsche mechanic Rolf Wütherich was badly injured but survived.   Only one of Dean’s movies, “East of Eden,” had been released at the time of his death (“Rebel Without a Cause” and “Giant” opened shortly afterward), but he was already on his way to superstardom--and the crash made him a legend.  September 30, 1955 : James Dean dies - HistorySeptember 30, 1955 : James Dean dies  Introduction  On this day in 1955, movie star James Dean dies at age 24 in a car crash on a California highway. Dean was driving his Porsche 550 Spyder, nicknamed “Little Bastard,” headed to a car race in Salinas, California, with his mechanic Rolf Wuetherich, when they were involved in a head-on collision with a car driven by a 23-year-old college student named Donald Turnaspeed. Dean was taken to Paso Robles War Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:59 p.m. Wuetherich, who was thrown from the car, survived the accident and Turnaspeed escaped with minor injuries. No charges were ever filed against him.  James Byron Dean was born February 8, 1931, in Marion, Indiana. He studied drama at the University of California, Los Angeles, before moving to New York City, where he appeared in plays and TV shows and took classes at the Actors Studio with legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg.  Dean rose to stardom in 1955 with his role as Cal Trask in East of Eden. He reportedly beat out Paul Newman for the part. Dean’s performance in the film, based on the John Steinbeck novel, earned him a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. It was the first time in Oscar history that an actor was nominated after his death. The young actor’s next film was “Rebel Without a Cause,” also released in 1955, in which he played a rebellious teen named Jim Stark. The film, which co-starred Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, turned Dean into the poster boy for disaffected youth and cool. Dean’s final film “Giant,” released in 1956 after his death, was an epic tale of a Texas cattle rancher and his family. Dean starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson and was nominated posthumously for a second Oscar for his performance as Jett Rink.

May 7th 2016  Nearly everyone has some kind of fear, and some fears are more common than others. Sometimes these fears are rooted in actual experiences and other times they are not. Even having multiple phobias is quite common. These are just some of the most common phobias, but there are much more that have been documented.  1. Arachnophobia  Arachnophobia is the fear of spiders. Many people who share this fear are typically affected by a childhood memory, or are just frightened by the appearance. Even the thought of one crawling on their skin can make them shudder in fear. In the dark ages, spiders were thought to harbor the bubonic plague and were seen as a source of food and water contamination, leading to a widespread fear of spiders.  2. Ophidiophobia  Ophidiophobia is a fear of snakes. Some experts believe that the fear of snakes may be an innate survival mechanism to protect people from poisonous reptiles, though others argue that if this was the case, this phobia wouldn\'t be as common as it is. This phobia can cause people to avoid places like zoos or pet stores.  3. Acrophobia  Acrophobia is a fear of heights. Unlike a lot of fears, this fear can manifest into other fears, such as a fear of flying or roller coasters. This fear can vary in severity as well. Some may avoid things like climbing ladders, while others may not be able to ride in an elevator or go to a high floor in a building.  4. Necrophobia  Necrophobia is the fear of death or dead things. This is a very common fear, especially after the loss of a loved one. This fear is a sort of defense mechanism of the mind. This can also be a very difficult phobia to overcome because of the uncertainty surrounding death and the large faith component associated with death and dying.  5. Cynophobia  Cynophobia is the fear of dogs, and is often the result of a traumatic experience. For example, someone bitten by a dog as an infant may have a fear of dogs into adulthood without knowing why. This phobia can cause people to avoid dog-owning friends or relatives.  6. Claustrophobia  Most people know that claustrophobia is the fear of confined spaces. This fear can manifest after a traumatic experience, such as being stuck in an elevator, though this is not always the case. Claustrophobia can vary in severity and is known to run in families.  7. Coulrophobia  Coulrophobia is the fear of clowns. Many people develop this fear as children, though this isn\'t always the case. Clowns are often portrayed in media as bad, such as in the move "It", or in real life as was the case with serial killer John Wayne Gacy who dressed up like a clown. This can trigger a phobia in some people.  8. Pediophobia  This is the phobia of dolls. Dolls were originally created as vessels for the dead, and this seems to be the root of many fears, particularly that the dolls could cause harm to the person with the phobia. One high profile case of pediophobia is that of Zak Bagans from the television show "Ghost Adventures." Bagans\' phobia is so intense that he cannon touch a doll or toy clown.  9. Hemophobia  This is the fear of blood. Some people experience feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness and occasionally faint at the sight of blood, even when it is something as small as a cut. The origins of this fear are unclear, but it may be related to a fear of death.  10. Glossaphobia  This is one phobia that many people struggle to overcome. Glossaphobia is the fear of public speaking. This phobia can manifest in childhood, and it\'s estimated that up to 75 percent of people have this fear to some degree.  11. Nyctophobia  This is one of the most common childhood fears, the fear of the darkness.

His infamy was sealed when the raid ended in three deaths.  He went on to become one of the world\'s most notorious militants as he masterminded deadly attacks across Europe, avoiding capture throughout the 1970s and 1980s.  For the past three decades years, he has been the face of violent Marxist struggle. He became a romanticised, exotic figure with his penchant for Havana cigars, womanising, berets, and alcohol adding to his enigmatic allure. Outside his revolutionary supporters though, he is simply seen as a cold-blooded terrorist.  Working in the name of far-left groups and Palestinian liberation, he claimed to have been responsible for killing more than 1,500 people in the name of his cause .  His latest trial in Paris deals with four attacks in the 1980s, thought to be part of his war against the French authorities to free two comrades, including his future wife, who were arrested planning to attack the Kuwaiti embassy.  Born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1949, Ramirez became a poster-boy for international militant Marxism as \'Carlos the Jackal\'. Ramirez took \'Carlos\' as his nom de guerre, and "The Jackal" was added by British journalists, after a Guardian writer saw a copy of Frederick Forsyth\'s book \'The Day of the Jackal\' in his London flat.  In the 1960s, the family moved to London, where Ramirez was partly brought up. The son of a wealthy Marxist lawyer, Jose Altagracia Ramirez Navas, he and his brothers were home-schooled by Communist tutors and all given revolutionary Communist names: Ilich, Lenin and Vladimir.  Ramirez headed to Moscow\'s Patrice Lumumba University, famed as a training ground for leftist revolutionaries and guerillas all over the world, but he was expelled in 1970.  He later moved to Lebanon, where he joined the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. His brother Vladimir explained to The Guardian that "he decided that the best way to defeat imperialism was to take up arms and the best place to do it was the Middle East."  He became increasingly in a range of international terrorist organisations, such as West Germany\'s Red Army Faction. Files released from police archives in Hungary, East Germany and Romania allegedly outline his involvement in a series of attacks.  With the collapse of European communism in 1989, Ramirez found life on the run more difficult. Eventually he took refuge in Sudan, where he was seized from a hospital room in 1994 and hauled to Paris on a private jet inside a sack by French agents.  Jailed for life in 1997 for three murders in Paris, he divorced his first wife Magdalena Kopp while in jail through the Muslim ritual of renunciation. He then married his French lawyer, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, whom he met and married in jail in 2001.  In a recent interview with French radio regarding his latest trial, he vowed to fight the charges with his characteristic revolutionary fervour, he insisted "I\'m still in a combative state of mind".  He has also remained as controversial as ever. Last month he praised Osama Bin Laden in France\'s Liberation newspaper, as a martyr who served as an "example ... for authentic resisters against imperialism."

There are ten numbercodedspecimens measuringapproximately 1 x 1 1/2 inches(except the diamond, dont you wish!). The determination of the hardness of a mineral can be an important step toward its identification. Hardness is the resistance which the smooth surfof a mineral offers to being scratched. A diamond is the hardest of all substances and can only be scratched by another diamond. Over a century ago, Friedrich Mohs by experimentation made up a scale of hardness which is referred to as Mohs scale. It does not imply an exact hardness, but is set up so that any mineral can scratch all those beneath it in the scale, or can be scratched by those above it in the scale. Since a diamond is the hardest it is given the number 10; talc is the softest so it is given number 1. Quartz is often used as a division in the scale and all those above 7 are called hard minerals. Here are the samples included in the set and their number on the scale of hardness: 1 Talc 6 Feldspar 2 Gypsum 7 Quartz 3 Calcite 8 Beryl 4 Fluorite 9 Corundum 5 Apatite 10 Diamond Some very familiar objects can be used in conjunction with this scale. A fingernail has the hardness of 2. 5, a copper coin between 3 and 4, a nail about 5, common window glass 5. 5, a steel file or porcelain tile 6. 5. Other minerals are sometimes substituted in the scale such as topaz for beryl since they both have a hardness of 8. Scale of hardness with diamond is recommended for grades 6 to 12.

The hardness of a mineral largely determines its durability and is related also to the strength and toughness of solid substances. It is important not to confuse hardness of a material with strength. Many hard materials (such as diamonds) are brittle and will break easily if they are struck. However, in common usage the term 'hardness' is often extended to include strength and toughness.  Strength of Materials  A full discussion of the strength of materials is beyond the scope of this Entry. Suffice it to say that there are different types of strength:  Types of strength  Bending  When it is bent.  Hence, in simple terms, the strength of a material is a measure of its resistance to various forms of deformation.  Hardness  The relative hardness of minerals is determined according to Mohs Scale, named after the German mineralogist, Friedrich Mohs , who devised it in 1812. In the original Mohs Scale, ten minerals were arranged in order of increasing hardness and were assigned the numbers one to ten.

Belgians were the first to experiment with fruit, adding raspberry and cherry into the mix, and today brewers have taken things even further, sweetening their suds with apples, blueberries, bananas and more.\xa0  Take a look at Gayot.com’s list of the top 10 fruit beers to find everything from tart lambics to crisp saisons to creamy strawberry beer.  1. Raspberry Redemption  Gayot.com  Joseph James Brewing Company - Henderson, NV  This microbrewery in Henderson, Nevada, is not shy about making extreme beers. Their Raspberry Redemption contains no sweet, syrupy fruit concentrate, but rather loads of the real McCoy. Eighty pounds of fresh raspberries are added during the boil. After the beer is done fermenting, it\'s transferred onto another 600 pounds of fresh raspberries, where it sits for three months, soaking up the true flavor of the fruit. Fifty pounds of Hershey\'s raw cocoa and Belgian candi sugar are also put in while the beer is cooking, which provides some sweet balance to the tartness of the true raspberry flavor of this beer. After bottling, this brew goes through a secondary fermentation, providing a natural carbonation, so this bottle-conditioned beer will have some natural yeast sediment left in the bottle after pouring.  Style: Belgian-Style Dubbel  Price: $11.99 for 750 ml  2. Lindemans Pomme  Gayot.com  Brouwerij Lindemans - Vlezenbeek, Belgium  The Lindemans brewery has its roots as a family farm with a small brewery that began the commercial brewing of lambic ales in 1811. The fruit seasoning this lambic is apple (pomme is French for apple). Long before hops were common in most beers, fruits and herbs were used as bittering agents! As with all Belgian lambics, immediately after being brewed the beer is left in vats open to the outside air, where it is fermented by a variety of wild yeasts. The yeast provides plenty of tartness, as do the fresh apples that are added during a secondary fermentation. This apple lambic pours a light golden hue with a thick foamy head of tightly packed bubbles. An aroma of sweet and sour apple dominates, which may remind you of a Sour Apple Jolly Rancher candy. A Granny Smith Apple sweet and sour flavor continues as you sip, with sweetness up front turning to tartness in the aftertaste. Unlike ciders, which tend to be overly sweet, this lambic has other complexities compliments of the yeast. This beer has a diminutive 3.5 percent alcohol content, making it easy drinking.  Style: Lambic/Fruit  Gayot.com  Lost Coast Brewery - Eureka, CA  One of the few breweries to be founded by women, Lost Coast Brewery in California\'s Humboldt Bay region began in 1986 when homebrewers Barbara Groom and Wendy Pound wondered what it would be like to open their own brewpub. From its humble beginnings, Lost Coast has grown exponentially and is now the 49th largest brewery in the U.S. and 36th largest craft brewery in the nation. This wheat beer pours a beautiful burnt orange honey color. Its aroma is anything but subtle and will remind you of a freshly peeled tangerine. Upon tasting, this beer makes a transformation, with an initial flavor delivering a mild tangerine sweetness that, after swallowing, turns into a tangy aftertaste with bitterness reminiscent of tangerine peel zest. Both flavors blend well with the combination of wheat and crystal malts and Perle finishing hops. Tangerine Wheat is one of Lost Coast\'s two fruit beer offerings, the other being its Raspberry Brown.

The wine can be made only in a strictly defined region comprising 14 wine-producing villages in the Troodos foothills about 20 miles (30km) north of the city of Limassol. In 1993, the European Union registered \'Commandaria\' as a protected name and geographical origin.  All Commandaria wines are both sweet and high in alcohol (15–20%). Their sweetness is entirely natural – the result of the high sugar levels wine grapes can achieve in Cyprus\' warm climate, later concentrated by the drying process the grapes undergo before vinification (see passito ). The high alcohol results from an addition of pure grape spirit (see fortification ).  The historic Commandaria wine style dates back to the late 12th century, when Guy de Lusignan was gifted the island by King Richard \'the Lionheart\' of England, who had captured it during the Crusades. De Lusignan fled to Cyprus after he was defeated and run out of Jerusalem. He imposed feudal rule and remained on the island until his death in 1194. The name \'Commandaria\' comes from the Grand Commandery, the feudal land belonging to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, where the original wine-producing vineyards were located.  Commandaria, southern Europe\'s most easterly wine region, has much in common with Oporto , its most westerly (some 2,300 miles away). Both produce sweet, fortified wines; both owe their existence to England\'s historic thirst for rich wine and war; both have had their name and style protected by law; and both are shipped down a river for ageing, to port cities which are the second largest in their respective nations.  One of the clearest differences between Commandaria and port is color: while Commandaria has a deep amber hue which gets darker as the years go by, port is red in its youth and bricks with age. Some Commandaria is made using a solera -style ageing system similar to those used to age sherry in Jerez \xa0(solera\xa0involves blending wine batches from successive years to create consistency of taste). There are even single-vintage cuvees produced in exceptional years.  Both red ( Mavro ) and white ( Xynisteri ) wine grapes are used to make Commandaria. Even today, their vines are generally trained into the traditional bush-vine form that was used before the development of structured trellising. The wine production and the style it produces remain true to the island\'s traditions in almost every regard.  Only a small quantity of Commandaria is made each vintage, so obtaining the wine is significantly more difficult than obtaining its western equivalents port or sherry. This rarity adds to its mystique and helps to maintain its firm ranking among the world\'s classic wines.

Commandaria has a rich history dating back\xa0to Homeric times when it was a popular drink at festivals celebrating the goddess of beauty Aphrodite who emerged from the sea at Paphos in Cyprus - a scene immortalized by Botticelli\'s famous painting, "the Birth of Venus".  A dried grape wine from Cyprus was first known to be described in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod and was known as the Cypriot Manna. Previously it was called "Mana" the Greek word for "Mother". The reason for this is very interesting. The wine was matured in giant earthenware jars. When the time came to pour it out, a certain amount was left in the bottom. When the new wine was added, the old wine helped it to mature. So the old became the mother of the new. It is very likely that the Commandaria you can buy today is the original Cypriot wine enjoyed by the Greek poet Homer and drunk by the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.

The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

Belfast West was the fourth by-election held since the 2010 General Election. There were 6 candidates on the ballot paper.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).

He was subsequently appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead. The by-election was held on the 9th June and was a easy hold for Sinn Fein.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database. There is no transcript for a trial of a Sweeney Todd, nor for that matter any similar crimes.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

Prince Charles and Princess Diana took up residence at Highgrove House soon after they were married in 1981.  "I knew I wanted to take care of the place in a very personal way and to leave it one day, in a far better condition than I found it."  HRH The Prince of Wales on Highgrove  The Duchy of Cornwall acquired Highgrove House from the MP Maurice Macmillan, son of former Tory Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1980.  The purchase added to the nation\'s speculation that the Prince was considering marriage.  Highgrove became the first home for Charles and Diana\'s young sons Princes William and Harry and they spent much of their early years on the estate prior to starting school.  Princess Diana is reported to have made many shopping trips to neighbouring Tetbury and Cirencester during her years at Highgrove and locals became used to seeing her and the young Princes out and about in the area.  Diana left Highgrove in the 1990s  Diana officially moved out of Highgrove following the breakdown of her marriage to Charles in the early 1990s.  Highgrove remains the official residence of Prince Charles. He has used the 37-acre estate to promote his interest in organic farming and gardening.  The Prince is well known for his love of nature and in his book Highgrove: Portrait of an Estate he writes: "I had absolutely no experience of gardening or farming, and the only trees I had planted had been official ones in very official holes.  "I knew I wanted to take care of the place in a very personal way and to leave it one day, in a far better condition than I found it".  Prince Charles lives at Highgrove  He is reputed to have spent £500,000 on the gardens at Highgrove taking advice on plants and design from famous garden expert Rosemary Verey of nearby Barnsley House before her death in the late 1990s.  Highgrove featured in a BBC Natural World TV documentary narrated by David Attenborough in January 2003.  Highgrove - a Prince\'s Legacy focused on a year in the life of the garden and estate farm and Prince Charles\' efforts to make it a showcase for traditional and organic growing methods.  There has long been keen public interest in the gardens. The  Garden is open regularly during the season, both to individuals and groups.

Dates: Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910 -- May 23, 1934); Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909 -- May 23, 1934)  Also Known As: Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, The Barrow Gang  Overview of Bonnie and Clyde  In some ways it was easy to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde. They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the "big, bad law" who were "out to get them." Clyde\'s impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie\'s poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!)  continue reading below our video  Profile of Bonnie and Clyde  Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law.  As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde\'s many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations.  While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush.  Background of Bonnie  Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker\'s job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas).  From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4\' 11" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.)  Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn\'t a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced.  While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929.  Background of Clyde  Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde\'s parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives.  When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.  At that time, West Dallas was a very rough neighborhood and Clyde fit right in. Clyde and his older brother, Marvin Ivan "Buck" Barrow, were often in trouble with the law for they were frequently stealing things | Question: In which year in the 1930\'s were Bonnie and Clyde killed?', ['1934'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6683'), ('Context: EastEnders star Danny Dyer becomes London Underground ...EastEnders star Danny Dyer becomes London Underground station announcer for the day  EastEnders star Danny Dyer becomes London Underground station announcer for the day  The actor will take over duties at Bromley-By-Bow  ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW  By David Brown  Wednesday 18 February 2015 at 12:01AM  London commuters passing through Bromley-By-Bow Underground station are in for a treat today as EastEnders star Danny Dyer takes over the tannoy announcements.

"I can’t tell you how much I loved sitting in the Bromley-By-Bow control room with them lovely ladies in their blue coats who work tirelessly.

The Straits of Tiran is closed to Israel by Egyptian president Nasser.  by charles-feigelstock  The Straits of Tiran, also known as the Suez Canal, is a very important artificial canal used for cargo. In the beginning of Nasser’s presidency in 1956 his closing of the Straits of Tiran was a catalyst for the Suez Crisis, which came to have international notoriety.  On this day May 22, in 1967, The Straits of Tiran are closed by Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. What ensued on June 5, 1967, came to be known as the Six Day War. Nasser made a blockade of all ships heading to Israel, despite it being made illegal by the U.N. in 1956.  The Six Day War was fought June 5-10, and it was a conclusive victory for Israel. The background of the war and the closing of the Straits have been traced back to false information the Soviet Union provided to Nasser. Egypt then amassed its own army, blockading the Straits of Tiran. In a pre-emptive attack Israel struck Jordan, Syria, and Egypt, all of whom had amassed armies set to invade. Israel won Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Sinai Peninsula in this war. The Soviet Union’s intentions, to this day, are still unknown.  Today’s History  Australis: Museum VictoriaAustralis: Museum Victoria  Propulsion: Reduction geared steam turbines / twin screws  Shipping Line: Chandris Line  History of the Ship  Originally named America, the immigrant ship Australis was designed by William Francis Gibbs and built for the North Atlantic trade – to travel between Europe and the United States. When launched on 31 August 1939 (by Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt), she was the largest passenger vessel to have ever been constructed in the United States and provided luxury accommodation for 1202 passengers in three classes.  In the midst of World War II, she was taken over by the US Navy and converted to an American troop ship capable of carrying 8175 soldiers. Realising the impact on public sentiment should America be sunk, the American government quickly renamed the ship the USS West Point. During the war, she visited ports in Europe, Africa and South America and was frequently attacked by Japanese forces.  After 12 years on the North Atlantic trade following the war, she was sold to the Chandris Line in 1965 and christened Australis, being converted to a fully air conditioned single class ship for the Australian migrant trade. A large portion of her original interior styling was maintained, and she remained adorned with many murals and Art Deco floor coverings during her immigration years.  Immigrant Ship to Australia  The Australis left Piraeus, Greece, for her first immigrant voyage to Australia on 21 August 1965, reaching Fremantle on 6 September and Melbourne on 13 September. She made a total of 62 voyages to Australia between 1965 and 1977, travelling regularly between Britain and Australia via the Suez Canal, stopping at ports such as Aden, Port Said and Colombo. In 1967, when the Suez was closed, she detoured around South Africa stopping at Cape Town and Durban. In 1970, while travelling between New Zealand and Suva, a fire broke out in the galley causing substantial damage, not only to the galley, but also to the ballroom and 40 cabins.  Passenger Experiences of the Journey  In the later years of the immigration boom, Australia saw many younger, single immigrants arriving with high expectations and a sense of adventure. At this time, the journey by ship was like a holiday for some passengers.  Gisela Pfab migrated from Germany in 1970:  'I was single and it turned out I had a lot of company on the boat. Soon we partied every night and didn't get to bed until in the early morning. As a result we missed our English classes most of the time.'  For others, the journey on the Australis was a pathway to freedom from political upheaval in their home country and the beginning of a new life.

Although the dockyard has long been closed and is now being redeveloped into a business and residential community as well as a museum featuring the famous submarine, HMS Ocelot, major naval buildings remain as the focus for a flourishing tourist industry. Chatham Dockyard, located on the River Medway and of which two-thirds is in Gillingham and one third in Chatham, Kent, England, came into existence at the time when, following the Reformation, relations with the Catholic countries of Europe had worsened, making it neccessary to acquire additional defences.  For 414 years Chatham Dockyard provided over 500 ships for the Royal Navy, and was forefront of shipbuilding, industrial and architectural technology. At its height, it employed over 10,000 skilled artisans and covered 400 acres or 1.6 km². Chatham dockyard closed in 1984, and 84 acres or 340,000 m2 of the Georgian dockyard is now managed as a visitor attraction by the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust. Chatham also has military connections; several Army barracks were located here, together with 19th century forts which provided a defensive shield for the dockyard. Brompton Barracks, located in the town, remains the headquarters of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The town has important road links and the railway and bus stations are the main interchanges for the area. It is the administrative headquarters of Medway unitary authority, as well as its principal shopping center. The Treasurer of the Navy's accounts of the King's Exchequer for the year of 1544 identifies Deptford as the Dockyard that carried out all the major repairs to the King's Ships that year.  That was soon to change, although Deptford remained a dockyard for over three centuries. In 1547 Jillingham water, as Chatham Dockyard was then known, is mentioned as second only in importance to Deptford; followed by Woolwich, Portsmouth and Harwich. In 1550 ships that were then lying off Portsmouth were ordered to be harboured in Jillingham Water, by reason of its superior strategic location. Chatham was established as a royal dockyard by Elizabeth I in 1567. She herself visited the yard in 1573. By the late 17th century it was the largest refitting dockyard and very important during the Dutch wars. The Medway, apart from Chatham Dockyard, has always had an important role in transportation: historically it provided a means for the transport of goods to and from the interior of Kent.

When the bacteria invade the body, they produce a poison (toxin) that causes painful muscle contractions. Another name for tetanus is "lockjaw" because it often causes a person\'s neck and jaw muscles to lock, making it hard to open the mouth or swallow. Vaccines are recommended for infants, children, teens, and adults to prevent tetanus.  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical ...Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  Tetanus disease | definition of Tetanus disease by Medical dictionary  http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Tetanus+disease  \xa0  Definition  Tetanus is a rare but often fatal disease that affects the central nervous system by causing painful muscular contractions. It begins when tetanus bacteria enter the body, usually through a wound or cut exposed to contaminated soil. Tetanus is easily preventable through vaccination .  Description  Tetanus is rare in the United States, with nearly all cases occurring in adults who were not vaccinated as children. About 100 cases are reported each year; 63% of these occur in people over the age of 50. The number of tetanus cases in the United States has steadily decreased since the 1940s (500 to 600 cases per year); the number of reported cases has remained at approximately 50 to 100 cases per year since the mid-1970s. In 1999, however, the lowest number of annual cases to date was reported (33, or 0.02 per 100,000).  Tetanus causes convulsive muscle spasms and rigidity that can lead to respiratory paralysis and death . It is sometimes called "lockjaw" because one of the most common symptoms is a stiff jaw, unable to be opened. Sometimes, tetanus affects only the part of the body where the infection began, but in almost all of reported cases, it spreads to the entire body. The incubation period from the time of the injury until the first symptoms appear ranges from two to 50 days. Symptoms usually occur within five to 10 days. When symptoms occur early, the chance of death is increased. Tetanus is not contagious.  Causes and symptoms  Tetanus is caused by a bacteria called Clostridium tetani, whose spores (the dormant form) are found in soil, street dust, and animal (or even human) feces. Tetanus spores germinate in the body, producing a highly poisonous neurotoxin in the blood, spreading to the nervous system. The infection is usually transmitted through deep puncture wounds or cuts or scratches that are not cleaned well. Between 1997 and 1999, approximately 64% of tetanus cases in the United States were associated with such wounds as punctures, lacerations, or abrasions. Many people associate tetanus with rusty nails and other dirty objects, but any wound can be a source. Less common ways of getting tetanus are animal scratches and bites, surgical wounds, dental work, and therapeutic abortion. About 18% of cases reported between 1997 and 1999 were a result of intravenous drug use. Cases have also been reported in people with no known wound or medical condition.  The first symptom of tetanus is often a stiff or "locked" jaw that prevents the patient from opening his/her mouth or swallowing. This is also called trismus and results in a facial expression called a sardonic smile (or risus sardonicus). Stiffness of the neck and other muscles throughout the body and uncontrollable spasms often follow. Sometimes these convulsions are severe enough to cause broken bones. The bacterial toxin (tetanospasmin) affects the nerve endings, causing a continuous stimulation of muscles. Other symptoms include irritability, restlessness, loss of appetite, and drooling. People with tetanus that is localized experience pain and tingling only at the wound site and spasms in nearby muscles.

She is an only child . Evie attends a school for gifted children ( run by her mother ) and achieves good grades there . Her mother had always told Evie that her father was a secret agent , but on her thirteenth birthday Evie began to develop superhuman abilities and it was revealed that her father is an extraterrestrial from the planet Antareus . Evie 's main power is the ability to freeze time on Earth by touching the tips of her index fingers together , allowing her to maneuver herself or objects to alter the course of events on Earth . When she claps her hands together , time resumes as normal . She can also `` unfreeze '' individuals by touching them while time is frozen . She later gains the power to gleep , which allows her to manifest objects by using the power of her mind . Her father describes her as `` the perfect child : loving ; caring ; with the same needs of most teenagers '' .

The two fell in love , were married in 1971 , and two years later Donna gave birth to Evie . Shortly after , in 1974 , Troy was called back to Antareus to fight in a war . Since then , Troy occasionally visits Earth , and stays in touch with his daughter via a special communication device known as the `` cube '' ( see below ) . Troy 's powers seem to be almost limitless : though he lives on Antareus , he can control many things on Earth ( from computers to the weather ) ; he can give and take away Evie 's powers at will ; and also seems to be aware of certain events on Earth . While Troy appears in the show 's opening credits , he rarely makes a physical appearance in the series -- and when he does his face is obscured ( for example , via a surgical mask or shadows ) .

Crossbreeding (parents of two          different purebred breeds) results in offspring          that may be stronger and healthier than either          parent, an effect called hybrid vigour.  Many dog crossbreds (hybrids) have been given fanciful or portmanteau names,  as in Labradoodle (purebred Labrador Retriever crossed with purebred Poodle.)  Further generations of crossbreds bred to crossbreds lose the advantage of  hybrid vigour, although they may still be called by the hybrid name, and may  eventually be recognized as a separate purebred dog breed.  Some dog hybrids are now being (very loosely) selectively bred. The term  designer dogs is often used to refer to these mixes and crosses. The practice  causes much controversy; opponents cite the often exorbitant prices charged for  what is just a mutt.  While the trend to produce hybrid or designer          dogs is considered new it is, in fact, a          continuation of the centuries-old practice of          selective breeding. Basically every breed of dog          is a "mutt" in the sense that every type of dog          was created by interbreeding different types of          dogs to produce a breed with a certain set of          desirable characteristics.  \xa0  \xa0  \xa0\xa0  A dog of unknown or complex heritage is called a mixed breed       dog; not the same as a crossbred (hybrid) dog, which has       known parents of two different purebred breeds.  \xa0\xa0  Hybrid of these two Dog Breeds  Catahoula Bulldog  Pug  Schnauzer  All dog breeds were bred for a particular       purpose, usually some form of hunting, herding, or guarding.       These tasks have been largely replaced by the need to       produce healthy dogs with good temperaments as domestic       companions or pets. Breeding two different breeds often       allows the best traits of both parents to pass through.       However, the difference between a designer mutt and a       purebred dog is generations of breeding a dog that looks and       acts almost exactly the same. Most \'hybrid\' dogs are only       first generation crosses, and are never taken further to       actually be considered selectively bred. The most selection       made is to select one breed (usually a poodle or cocker       spaniel) to breed to any and every breed out there.  This       has resulted in a surge of popularity for certain crosses in       which a desirable mix of traits occurs. The Labradoodle, for       example, was first bred as an attempt to develop guide dog       for visually impaired people with allergies. Unfortunately,       the popularity of hybrids such as "Labradoodles" has       resulted in rampant, and often unscrupulous, breeding. The       resulting pups do not reliably demonstrate the desirable       characteristics, such as a hypo-allergenic coat, that the       original breeders were attempting to standardize, because       they consist of only first or second generation crosses, and       do not hold a standard, and cannot be bred reliably for the       same outcome.  Dog hybrids are not recognized by the main breed       registries, as they only register purebred dogs. New breeds       of dogs must have a breed club that will document the       ancestry of any individual member of that breed from the       original founding dogs of the breed; when the kennel club       that the breed club wishes to join is satisfied that the       dogs are purebred, they will accept and register the dogs of       that breed. Each kennel club has individual rules about how       to document a new breed. Hybrid dogs, created by breeding       two purebred dogs of different breeds (crossbred), have the       advantage of heterosis, or hybrid vigor, and are often       stronger and healthier than either of the parents.

Belgians were the first to experiment with fruit, adding raspberry and cherry into the mix, and today brewers have taken things even further, sweetening their suds with apples, blueberries, bananas and more.\xa0  Take a look at Gayot.com’s list of the top 10 fruit beers to find everything from tart lambics to crisp saisons to creamy strawberry beer.  1. Raspberry Redemption  Gayot.com  Joseph James Brewing Company - Henderson, NV  This microbrewery in Henderson, Nevada, is not shy about making extreme beers. Their Raspberry Redemption contains no sweet, syrupy fruit concentrate, but rather loads of the real McCoy. Eighty pounds of fresh raspberries are added during the boil. After the beer is done fermenting, it\'s transferred onto another 600 pounds of fresh raspberries, where it sits for three months, soaking up the true flavor of the fruit. Fifty pounds of Hershey\'s raw cocoa and Belgian candi sugar are also put in while the beer is cooking, which provides some sweet balance to the tartness of the true raspberry flavor of this beer. After bottling, this brew goes through a secondary fermentation, providing a natural carbonation, so this bottle-conditioned beer will have some natural yeast sediment left in the bottle after pouring.  Style: Belgian-Style Dubbel  Price: $11.99 for 750 ml  2. Lindemans Pomme  Gayot.com  Brouwerij Lindemans - Vlezenbeek, Belgium  The Lindemans brewery has its roots as a family farm with a small brewery that began the commercial brewing of lambic ales in 1811. The fruit seasoning this lambic is apple (pomme is French for apple). Long before hops were common in most beers, fruits and herbs were used as bittering agents! As with all Belgian lambics, immediately after being brewed the beer is left in vats open to the outside air, where it is fermented by a variety of wild yeasts. The yeast provides plenty of tartness, as do the fresh apples that are added during a secondary fermentation. This apple lambic pours a light golden hue with a thick foamy head of tightly packed bubbles. An aroma of sweet and sour apple dominates, which may remind you of a Sour Apple Jolly Rancher candy. A Granny Smith Apple sweet and sour flavor continues as you sip, with sweetness up front turning to tartness in the aftertaste. Unlike ciders, which tend to be overly sweet, this lambic has other complexities compliments of the yeast. This beer has a diminutive 3.5 percent alcohol content, making it easy drinking.  Style: Lambic/Fruit  Gayot.com  Lost Coast Brewery - Eureka, CA  One of the few breweries to be founded by women, Lost Coast Brewery in California\'s Humboldt Bay region began in 1986 when homebrewers Barbara Groom and Wendy Pound wondered what it would be like to open their own brewpub. From its humble beginnings, Lost Coast has grown exponentially and is now the 49th largest brewery in the U.S. and 36th largest craft brewery in the nation. This wheat beer pours a beautiful burnt orange honey color. Its aroma is anything but subtle and will remind you of a freshly peeled tangerine. Upon tasting, this beer makes a transformation, with an initial flavor delivering a mild tangerine sweetness that, after swallowing, turns into a tangy aftertaste with bitterness reminiscent of tangerine peel zest. Both flavors blend well with the combination of wheat and crystal malts and Perle finishing hops. Tangerine Wheat is one of Lost Coast\'s two fruit beer offerings, the other being its Raspberry Brown.  Style: Fruit Beer  Gayot.com  New Belgium Brewing - Fort Collins, CO  Released in 2012 as part of New Belgium Brewing\'s Lips of Faith series, this ale was crafted in honor of alternative hip hop and blues musician G. Love, a huge fan of the brewery who has been home brewing since high school.

Between 1943 and 1949, 54 animals received the medal, including 32 pigeons, 18 dogs and 3 horses.\xa0Here are just a few examples.  Simon The Cat  Simon, the ship\'s cat aboard HMS Amethyst during the Yangtze Incident of 1949, was awarded a posthumous PDSA Dickin Medal for his devotion to duty despite suffering terrible injuries when the British warship was shelled by the Chinese Communist forces. During the 101 days HMS Amethyst was held captive on the Yangtze River, Simon devoted his time to catching the rats that threatened the crew\'s dwindling rations.  GI Joe, Pigeon  GI Joe, Pigeon \xad USA43SC6390, was awarded the PDSA Dickin medal in August 1946. The citation reads: “This bird is credited with making the most outstanding flight by a USA Army Pigeon in World War II. Making the 20 mile flight from British 10th Army HQ, in the same number of minutes, it brought a message which arrived just in time to save the lives of at least 100 Allied soldiers from being bombed by their own planes.”  Rob a War Dog  Rob, a\xad Collie (War Dog No. 471/332 Special Air Service) was awarded the PDSA Dickin medal on 22nd \xa0January 1945. Citation: “Took part in landings during North African Campaign with an Infantry unit and later served with a Special Air Unit in Italy as patrol and guard on small detachments lying-up in enemy territory. His presence with these parties saved many of them from discovery and subsequent capture or destruction. Rob made over 20 parachute descents.”  Upstart the Police Horse  Upstart \xad was a police horse awarded the PDSA Dickin medal on 11th\xa0April 1947.

The PDSA Dickin Medal was instituted in 1943 in the United Kingdom by Maria Dickin to honour the work of animals in war. It is a bronze medallion , bearing the words "For Gallantry" and "We Also Serve" within a laurel wreath, carried on a ribbon of striped green, dark brown and pale blue. [1] It is awarded to animals that have displayed "conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units". [1] The award is commonly referred to as "the animals\' Victoria Cross ". [1] [2] [3]  Maria Dickin was the founder of the People\'s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), a British veterinary charity.  She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with British Empire armed forces or civil emergency services.  The medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949 – to 32 pigeons, 18 dogs, three horses, and one cat – to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the Second World War , and subsequent conflicts.

"An adult human brain has more than 100 billion neurons"  >\xa0100 billion  One of the most remarkable aspects of the adult nervous system is the human brain. The human brain controls memory, vision, learning, thought, consciousness and other activities. By means of electrochemical impulses the brain directly controls conscious or voluntary behavior. It also monitors, through feedback circuitry, most involuntary behavior and influences automatic activities of the internal organs.  During fetal development the foundations of the mind are laid as billions of neurons form appropriate connections and patterns. No aspect of this complicated structure has been left to chance. The basic wiring plan is encoded in the genes. It has been shown from previous studies that in developing embryos of animals, nerve cells are created in or travel to designated regions of the brain, and once in place send out axons along preprogrammed paths to make contact with specific targets.  The brain\'s billions of neurons connect with one another in complex networks. All physical and mental functioning depends on the establishment and maintenance of neuron networks. A person\'s habits and skills -- such as nail-biting or playing a musical instrument -- become embedded within the brain in frequently activated neuron networks. When a person stops performing an activity, the neural networks for the activity fall into disuse and eventually may disappear.  Differences in weight and size of a person\'s brain does not correlate with differences in mental ability. The adult human brain normally weighs from 1.0 to 1.5\xa0kg (2¼ to 3¼\xa0lbs).  The work of the brain is similar to a combination of a computer and a chemical factory. So take good care of your PC!

Search the site  By Kendra Cherry - Reviewed by a board-certified physician.  Updated March 11, 2016  How many neurons are in the human brain? Older estimates have long suggested that 100 billion was the magic number, but some more recent research suggests that the brain actually contains fewer neurons than previously believed.  The human brain is made up of a complex network of neurons . These neurons serve as the building blocks of the nervous system, transmitting information to and from the brain and throughout the body.  You probably expect that a large number of neurons are required for such a complex process, but just how many neurons are there in the human brain?  How Many Neurons are in the Human Brain?  According to many estimates, the human brain contains around 100 billion neurons (give or take a few billion). This estimate has often been reported for many years in neuroscience and psychology textbooks and for many years was simply accepted as a relatively close approximation.  Recently, however, Brazilian researcher Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel discovered that these estimates might not be entirely accurate. While the number is widely cited, she found that no one seemed to know where this number originated. She then decided to investigate in order to determine if the number is accurate. | Question: The human brain is made up of between 10 billion and 100 billion nerve cells known as what?', ['nerve cells', 'neuron', 'neurons'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1877'), ("Context: Canopic jars were used by the ancient Egyptians during the mummification process to store and preserve the viscera of their owner for the afterlife .

His breakthrough came in 1982 when he co-wrote and co-starred in BBC Television’s The Young Ones, a situation comedy featuring a group of revolting students on the breadline, squeezing spots, baring bottoms and sharing a filthy flat.  Arms flailing and eyes bulging, Mayall’s character, the angst-ridden loud-mouthed student Rick, chimed with the programme’s unpredictable “alternative” quality. The show tore up the established rules of comedy; the resulting 35 minutes of rampaging, violent slapstick struck some as having more in common with Warner Bros cartoons than with traditional sitcoms.  Related Articles  22 Jan 2009  Mayall in The Young Ones with Adrian Edmonson, Nigel Planer and Christopher Ryan (BBC)  Mayall wrote The Young Ones with his then girlfriend Lise Meyer and another emerging alternative comedy star Ben Elton. Although it found a cult audience straight away — mostly students, teenagers and twentysomethings — others were slow to catch on and it was only when the series was repeated that it began to build a sizeable audience.  In contrast to his outrageous, rebarbative characterisations, Mayall was quietly-spoken and shy, with a reputation as the chameleon comedian: “fluent, funny, polite, informed” noted one of the comparatively few interviewers he spoke to, but “also evasive, slippery, canny, cautious and a tad self-congratulatory”.  “There’s a quality about me,” Mayall himself once confessed, “that you don’t quite trust”.  Although he became a defining part of the television landscape of the 1980s — including a memorable turn as the rumbustiously randy Squadron Commander Flashheart in Blackadder Goes Forth (“Always treat your kite like you treat your woman ... get inside her five times a day and take her to heaven and back!”) — Mayall always preferred working in the live theatre. His fellow comic actor Simon Fanshawe ascribed to Mayall “a kind of pure energy as a solo performer on stage that, if you are prepared for the ride, is irresistible”.  In April 1998, when he was 40, a near-fatal accident on a quad bike left Mayall in a coma for five days; severe head injuries caused impaired memory, shaky co-ordination and speech problems. “The accident was over Easter and as you know, Jesus our Lord was nailed to the cross on Good Friday,” recounted Mayall in an interview last year. “The day before that is Crap Thursday, and that’s the day Rik Mayall died. And then he was dead on Good Friday, Saturday, Sunday until Bank Holiday Monday.”  But he appeared to have made a complete recovery, and returned to work in blustering form as Richie Twat (pronounced Thwaite) in Guesthouse Paradiso (1999), a film he co-wrote with his friend and long-time comedy partner Adrian Edmondson.  Although his part as Peeves the poltergeist in the first Harry Potter film failed to make the final cut, Mayall remained philosophical. “I’ve looked over the edge,” he remarked, adding that his brush with death had taught him that ending up on the cutting room floor hardly seemed so bad.

On November 9, 1922, he was named the winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."  The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from the surface of matter  (usually metals) when light shines on it. Einstein explained the effect by proposing that light consists of small particles, or quanta, called photons, which carry energy that is proportional to the frequency of light. The electrons in the matter that absorb the energy of the photon get ejected. He published these findings in 1905 in the paper "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light." Einstein\'s observations that the photoelectric effect could be explained only if light behaves like a particle, not a wave, was instrumental in establishing the hypothesis that light can behave both like a wave and a particle.  The photoelectric effect is the basis for photosynthesis. It also forms the basis for a variety of devices such as photodiodes, which are used in light detection within fiber optics, telecommunications networks, solar cells, imaging, and many other applications.  An interesting note: Records show the Nobel Prize Awarding Institution, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, decided to reserve the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, and therefore awarded no Physics prize that year. According to the statutes, a reserved prize can be awarded the year after, and Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for 1921 one year later, in 1922.  Einstein was unable to attend the December 10 Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm. He presented his Nobel speech on July 11, 1923, in Gothenburg.  Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, NJ.

How to Write 225 Words Per Minute With a Pen - The AtlanticHow to Write 225 Words Per Minute With a Pen - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  How to Write 225 Words Per Minute With a Pen  A lesson in the lost technology of shorthand  Students in the shorthand class at Broken Bow College, 1903. Nebraska State Historical Society  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  As a journalist, I begin most interviews by holding up my pen and asking, “Have you ever seen one of these?” No one ever has.  It’s not an ordinary pen, of course. It’s a Sky wifi smartpen , a piece of gee-whiz technology from a company called Livescribe. Basically, the smartpen replaces all your standard reporter’s tools. To start with, it’s an old-fashioned pen for old-fashioned paper, so I can still scribble my notes the way I always have. The smartpen is also a high-quality digital recorder, creating an audio file of the interview as we go along. Finally, a tiny camera near the tip of the pen simultaneously takes pictures of my notes as I write.  Gregg is a way of compressing language. You are the machine that does the encoding and decoding. And your brain can do it in real time at very, very high speeds.  All of that information is then pulled together by a microprocessor housed in the barrel of the pen. And because the smartpen is really a computer, it’s able to sync up the picture of my handwritten notes with the audio file. That means I can tap the tip of the pen anywhere in my notebook, and the pen will instantly replay the audio of whatever was being said when I took that note. And since it’s WiFi enabled, the whole interview—audio file, notes, and all—is automatically uploaded to my Evernote account. It’s a little like magic.  There’s one other feature I like to point out. It’s possible, I tell people, to get optical character recognition software to go with the pen. If you write like a normal person, the OCR will automatically convert your handwritten notes into a text file that you can then copy and paste into your word processor. For many reporters, this is the best feature, obviating the painful task of transcribing long interviews. But it doesn’t work for me, I explain, because even though I’m recording this interview with the latest model Sky wifi smartpen, I’m taking notes using a 19th Century technology called Gregg shorthand | Question: What is the American word for a short-hand typist?', ['stenographer', 'shorthand typist', 'shorthand'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4123'), ('Context: The Roosevelt Corollary was an addition to the Monroe Doctrine articulated by President Theodore Roosevelt in his State of the Union address in 1904 after the Venezuela Crisis of 1902 -- 03 .

It is dynastically sort of a continuation to Cenél nGabráin of Dál Riata, "race of Fergus", as "house" an originally Celtic concept to express one of the two rivalling leader clans of early medieval Scotland, whose founding father is king Fergus Mor of Dalriada. This Ferguside royal clan had rivalled the crown (of Dalriada, then that of Alba) against the Cenél Loairn, the later House of Moray for the preceding four or more centuries. The Cenél nGabráin were represented by the so-called House of Alpin before Dunkeld.  Sir Iain Moncreiffe made the case that Crínán of Dunkeld actually belonged to a Scottish sept of Irish Cenél Conaill royal dynasty.[1] This of course would not exclude his descendants from also being a (female line) continuation of the Cenél nGabráin through Bethóc.  Genealogically the Dunkeld dynasty is based on Duncan I of Scotland being of a different agnatic clan to his predecessor and maternal grandfather Malcolm II of Scotland. However, sociohistorically, the reign of Duncan\'s son Malcolm III of Scotland, which happens to coincide with the start of the centuries-long period of strong influence from the southern neighbour, the Kingdom of England, has been seen as a more important place to start.  Domnall III, r. 1093-1094 and 1094-1097  Donnchad II, r. 1094  William I (William the Lion), r.1165-1214  Alexander II, r.1214-1249  House of StuartThe House of Stuart, originally Stewart and, in Gaelic, Stiubhard is a European royal house that originated in Scotland. The dynasty\'s patrilineal Breton ancestors had held the office of High Steward of Scotland since the 12th century, after arriving by way of Norman England. The royal Stewart line was founded by Robert II, and they were Kings and Queens of Scots from the late 14th century through the union with England in 1707.  Mary I, Queen of Scots was brought up in France, where she adopted the French spelling of the name, Stuart.  Her son, James VI of Scotland, inherited the thrones of England and Ireland upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603.  Except for the period of the Commonwealth, 1649-1660, the Stuarts were monarchs of England, Scotland and Ireland until 1707; then of Great Britain and Ireland, to the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. James VI of Scotland then inherited the realms of Elizabeth I of England, becoming James\xa0I of England and Ireland in the Union of the Crowns. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688, two Stuart queens ruled the isles: Mary II and Anne. Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife.  Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who would brought up a Roman Catholic and would precede his half-sisters; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters.  But neither had any children who survived to adulthood, so under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704, the crown passed to the House of Hanover on the death of Queen Anne in 1714.  During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, to the midpoint of the Early modern period.

Tom Mankiewicz was asked to revamp the script and it was soon renamed Hart to Hart. With Robert Wagner as self-made millionaire Jonathan Hart, Stefanie Powers as his journalist wife Jennifer and Lionel Stander as their trusty sidekick Max the "Hartbeat" began. Premiering on August 25, 1979, Hart was met with mixed reviews but by the end of the first season Jonathan and Jennifer Hart were household names. Guest appearances were made by everyone from Stella Stevens and Roddy McDowell to Jill St. John and Dorothy Lamour and even a cameo by Natalie Wood. The series would run for five seasons before leaving ABC in 1984. Hart to Hart is still airing in syndication in over 60 countries worldwide. In 1993 while touring together in A.R. Gurney\'s Love Letters, RJ, Stefanie and Lionel would return to television\xa0in the first of what would be eight 2-hour Hart movies. Jokingly dubbed "Hart to Hart: The New Generation", Jonathan and Jennifer still found themselves going from one adventure to the next. The first five would air as NBC Friday Night Mysteries. Sadly, Lionel Stander died shortly after completing the fifth movie and the sixth movie saw the Harts atending Max\'s funeral. The final three movies aired on The Family Channel. Interesting tidbit. The last movie aired on Aug 25 1996. Exactly 17 years (to the date) of the airing of the pilot movie. ======================== Company credits Production Companies * Columbia Pictures Television * Rona II * Spelling-Goldberg Productions Distributors * American Broadcasting Company (ABC) * Columbia TriStar Domestic Television (2001) * Independent Television (ITV) * Sony Pictures Television (2002-) ======================== Awards American Cinema Editors, USA 1980 -- Nominated -- Best Edited Episode from a Television Series -- Bob Bring [For episode "Max in Love".] Emmy Awards 1982 -- Nominated -- Outstanding Art Direction for a Series -- James J.

Up until recently, the matter had been dealt with in the UK in an ad hoc fashion, sometimes using supervisory powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and its legislative predecessors. Generally speaking, however, there had been no legislation in the UK peculiar to the situation of banks in financial difficulties; thus the insolvency of a bank fell within the general rules that relate to insolvency, rather than under any legislation specifically tailored for banks. For instance, in the administration of Lehman Bros International (Europe) and its associated companies, the rights of creditors and other counterparties of the insolvent companies (including those asserting proprietary claims) have been governed by the usual procedures and so subjected to the moratorium that applies in an administration against asserting and enforcing claims1,.  As a temporary measure, following upon the failure of Northern Rock PLC, the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 came into force, which permitted the UK authorities to take action so that the share capital and the business, assets and liabilities of failed authorised deposit takers could be transferred, in whole or in part, to the Bank of England, the Treasury or a commercial entity. The Act specifically provided that the powers under it would cease to be exercisable on 21st February, 2009 (S. 2(8)), but without prejudice to action taken beforehand (S. 2(9)). It was pursuant to the Act that Bradford & Bingley PLC was nationalised and some of its engagements passed over to Abbey National PLC on 29th September, 20082. The Act was also used in relation to Northern Rock PLC3 and in two later instances, relating to Heritable Bank PLC4 and Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander Ltd5.  After consultation during 2008, the Government sought to deal with matters on a more permanent footing. It introduced the Banking Bill before Parliament in October, 2008. The Bill provided for the application of a "Special Resolution Regime" in relation to banks in difficulties. The Bill also contained provisions dealing with other topics, such as funding of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, inter-bank payment schemes and financial stability within the UK, as well as various miscellaneous matters. The Bill was given initial consideration by Parliament before its session came to an end in November, 2008. It was then re-introduced in the new session of Parliament and received the Royal Assent as an Act of Parliament on 12th February, 2009 and thereby became the Banking Act 2009. The parts of the Act dealing with the Special Resolution Regime came into force shortly thereafter, on 17th and 21st February, 20096. Some of the other parts of the Act have yet to be brought into force.  In a number of places, the Act provides for secondary legislation to be made to amplify upon matters referred to in it. It also provides, in Ss 5, 6, 12 and 13 for a Code of Practice (the "Code") to be issued by the Treasury, relating to the use of the Special Resolution Regime. The Code was issued and laid before Parliament on 23rd February, 20097.  S. 10 of the Act provides for the establishment of a "Banking Liaison Panel" to advise on matters relating to the Special Resolution Regime, including the making of secondary legislation pertaining to it, the Code and certain of the powers of the Treasury under S. 75 to amend the law (but not, as the Code notes at Para. 6.23, to provide advice on the exercise of a power under S. 75 which "is carried out in connection with or to facilitate a [proposed or actual] particular use of a stabilisation power").

Edith Cresson was born January 27, 1934, in a fashionable Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Her father was a senior civil servant. Raised by a British nanny, she became fluent in the English language. Cresson attended the School of Advanced Commercial Studies, earning a degree in business and later a doctorate in demography.  A successful businesswoman, she added a second career in politics when she met François Mitterrand in 1965. For the next 26 years the future president helped Cresson advance through the ranks of what is now the French Socialist Party, calling her "my little soldier."  After Mitterrand became president in 1981, Cresson served first as minister of agriculture (1981-1983), then as minister of external trade and tourism (1983-1984), as minister of industrial restructuring and external trade (1984-1986), and finally minister of foreign affairs (1988-1990). She resigned from the government on October 3, 1990, to work as a consultant on international development. Meanwhile she was three times elected a deputy to the National Assembly from the Vienne province (1981, 1986, 1988).  Then in May 1991, President Mitterrand asked Cresson to form a new government. Some experts believe Mitterand had grown dissatisfied with the failures of the government of Michel Rocard to gain majorities in the National Assembly.   Others believe the French president foresaw major international trade issues looming as the trans-European Union came into existence, and sought Cresson\'s expertise in trade affairs.  As prime minister, the combative Cresson planned to strengthen France\'s industrial power and to "protect" French and European trade from the inroads of Japanese and American products. In assembling her new cabinet of 29 members she chose a number of holdovers from the government of her predecessor. One, Pierre Brgovoy, was named to head a new superministry combining economic, trade, industrial, and technology affairs. His appointment served to restore trust in the French leadership in financial markets. She also appointed five women, three to posts in labor, development, and youth and sports.  When her appointment to prime minister drew misogynist remarks from some politicians of France\'s center and right parties, Cresson said, "Men are not in any sense irreplaceable except in one\'s private life." Nevertheless, more fair-minded criticism about her ability to command majorities in the National Assembly persisted.  The Cresson government moved aggressively to free what had become a stagnant economy, and on contentious domestic issues, frequently centered around immigrants. Quoted making strident and antagonistic comments about the Japanese "strategy of conquest," Cresson was greatly concerned over what she was convinced to be Japan\'s major threat to European trade and commonwealth. Diplomatically, her outspokenness was creating unease in international circles. Within four months of becoming president, the Cresson government had fallen precipitously in popularity. Subtle and not-so-subtle attacks on her gender continued, including a popular daytime television show featuring two puppet characters, one a sexy and servile female broadly seen as a Cresson parody. In April 1992, Cresson resigned. Since then she has served as Commissioner for Science, Research and Development to the European Commission.  Cresson\'s husband, Jacques, a retired executive of Peugeot, the French automobile and appliance company, remained supportive of his wife, and their relationship has been likened to that of Margaret Thatcher and her husband. Cresson has been compared to the British prime minister for her bluntness, energy, and stubbornness. They have two daughters.  Further Reading on Edith Cresson  The appointment and career of Cresson was covered in the Washington Post (May 16 and May 18, 1991). See also "An Iron Lady Across the Channel?"

The first paperback copy appeared in 1948, published by the British Publishers Guild.  Background  All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer\'s native Swansea in South Wales. Written over a number of years, the often comic stories show glimpses of his life, from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post.  Thomas claimed, in a letter to Vernon Watkins, that he had "kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons". He claimed also, somewhat dubiously, that the title was not a parody of James Joyce\'s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, although the general influence of Joyce\'s Dubliners was freely acknowledged. In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins: "I\'ve been busy over stories, pot-boiling stories for a book, semi-autobiographical, to be finished by Christmas."  Reception  Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well. Ferris, reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said: "the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more". Critic Jacob Korg later commented that "taken as a group, [the stories] seem to trace the child\'s emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering, pathos, and dignity".  The book has been described as showing Thomas\' "waggish humor at its best, his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display".  Apart from Under Milk Wood, the book is "probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts". It has been suggested that few writers "have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious".   Adaptations  The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas\' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014.   Contents  * "The Peaches"  * "A Visit to Grandpa\'s"  * "Patricia, Edith and Arnold"  * "The Fight"  * "Extraordinary Little Cough"  * "Just Like Little Dogs"  * "Where Tawe Flows"  * "Who Do You Wish Was with Us?"  * "Old Garbo"  * "One Warm Saturday"  Under Milk WoodUnder Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, commissioned by the BBC and later adapted for the stage. A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972.  An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village Llareggub ("bugger all" backwards).  They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business.  Origins and development  When Thomas was staying at New Quay, Cardiganshire, in West Wales, one winter, he went out early one morning into the still sleeping town and verses came to his mind about the inhabitants. He wrote the account of this as a short story named "Quite Early One Morning" (recorded for BBC Wales on 14 December 1944 and broadcast 31 August 1945). He continued to work on the idea for the remaining eight years of his life.

Their leader was William Quantrill and they included Jesse James and his brother Frank.     Early in the war, Missouri and Kansas, nominally under Union government, had become bandit country, with groups of Confederate bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers competing for control. The town of Lawrence, Kansas, a centre of anti-slavery sentiment, had outlawed Quantrill’s men and jailed some of their young womenfolk. In August 1863, Quantrill led a furious attack on the town, killing over 180 civilians, supposedly in retaliation for the casualties caused when the women’s jail had collapsed, possibly by design.  The Confederate government, which had granted Quantrill a field commission under the Partisan Ranger Act, was outraged and withdrew support for such irregular forces. By 1864, Quantrill had lost control of the group, which split-up into small bands. Some, including Quantrill, were killed in various engagements. Others lived on, to hold reunions many years later, when the name Quantrill\'s Raiders began to be used.  Origins  The Missouri-Kansas border area was fertile ground for the outbreak of guerrilla warfare when the Civil War erupted in 1861. Historian Albert Castel wrote:  In February 1861 Missouri voters elected delegates to a statewide convention, which rejected secession by a vote of 89-1. Unionists, led by regular U.S. Army commander Nathaniel Lyon and Frank Blair of the politically powerful Blair family, and increasingly pro-secessionist forces, led by governor Claiborne Jackson and future Confederate general Sterling Price, contested for the political and military control of the state. By June, there was open warfare between Union forces and troops supporting the Confederacy. Guerrilla warfare immediately erupted throughout the state and intensified in August after the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson\'s Creek.   By August 1862, with the Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge, the state was free of significant regular Confederate troops but the violence in Missouri continued. One historical work describes the situation in the state after Wilson\'s Creek:  The most notorious of these guerrilla forces was led by William Clarke Quantrill.  Methods and legal status  Quantrill was not the only Confederate guerrilla operating in Missouri, but he rapidly gained the greatest notoriety. He and his men ambushed Union patrols and supply convoys, seized the mail, and occasionally struck towns on either side of the Kansas-Missouri border. Reflecting the internecine nature of the guerrilla conflict in Missouri, Quantrill directed much of his effort against pro-Union civilians, attempting to drive them from the territory where he operated.  Quantrill\'s guerrillas attacked Jayhawkers, Union militia, and U.S. forces relying primarily on ambush and raids.   Under his direction, Confederate guerrillas perfected military tactics such as disguises, coordinated and synchronized attacks, planned dispersal after an attack using pre-planned routes and relays of horses, and technical methods, including the use of multiple .36 caliber Colt revolvers, for increased firepower and their improved accuracy over the .44 caliber.  Confederate induction  On 15 August 1862, Quantrill was granted a field commission as a captain in the Confederate army under the Confederate Partisan Ranger Act.  Other officers were elected by the men. Quantrill often referred to himself as a colonel. Despite the legal responsibility assumed by the Confederate government, Quantrill often acted on his own with little concern for his government\'s policy or orders.  His most notable operation was the Lawrence Massacre, a revenge raid on Lawrence, Kansas in August 1863.  Lawrence Massacre  Lawrence had historically been the base of operations for abolitionist and jayhawker organizations.  During the period of border warfare (1855-1861), known as "Bleeding Kansas" in the press, and during the Civil War, irregular raids into Missouri by abolitionists, redlegs, and jayhawkers and Union soldiers, resulted in robberies, theft, arson, and the murder of citizens.  In August 1863, Union authorities assigned to the border were frustrated by the hit-and-run tactics of Quantrill\'s guerrillas | Question: Quantrill\'s Raiders, a loosely organised force of Partisan rangers under the leadership of William Clarke Quantril, fought in which war?', ['american civil war'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3014'), ('Context: Iceland Quick & Fun Facts - Icelandair Mid-AtlanticIceland Quick & Fun Facts  Iceland Quick & Fun Facts  Iceland Quick & Fun Facts  Iceland has the most active volcano area in the world, the largest waterfall and glacier in Europe, the northern most botanical garden and golf course in the world, the cleanest capital in the world, a population with the longest life expectancy and had the first democratically elected female president in the world, Mrs. Vigdis Finnbogadottir.  And there is more…  Iceland is one of the Nordic countries and part of Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden).  Reykjavík is the capital city of the Republic of Iceland.  Hvannadalshnukur (2,119m) is the highest point in Iceland.  Vatnajokull glacier in Southeast Iceland is Europe’s largest glacier.  Hekla is Iceland\'s most active volcano; Hekla is also a common female name in Iceland.  In 1963 a new volcano appeared in the Atlantic close to Iceland. It grew to become an island now called Surtsey.  The English word "geyser" comes from Iceland\'s Great Geysir in Haukadalur.  The phenomenon of the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) can be seen during mid-winter (November-December) when the weather is clear.  The "Althingi", the Icelandic parliament, dates back to the early tenth century.  The last name of Icelanders is derived from their father\'s first name.  In the telephone book everyone is listed by their first name.  In the last quarter of the nineteenth century twenty percent of Iceland\'s population emigrated to Canada and the USA.  In the 1960s and 70s there was a dispute between Iceland and the UK over fishing grounds, known as the "Cod Wars".  The population of Iceland reached 300,000 in the year 2006.  Soccer is Iceland’s favourite team game.  Icelandic, the language, belongs to the Germanic language family that includes German, Dutch and all the Nordic languages except Finnish. Its closest \'living relative\' is Faroese - both are derived from Old Norse.  Iceland, Not so quick (but still fun) facts!  Supernatural Iceland  Elves, trolls and ghosts  Surveys show that despite their obsession with modern technology, as many as 80% of Icelanders believe in the existence of elves. Even today, roads have been rerouted and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.  All around the country, strange lava formations were once explained in folktales as trolls who were turned to stone when caught outdoors in daylight. But only children in Iceland believe in trolls today, and the once widespread belief in ghosts is in decline, some say because electricity has taken the fright out of the long winter nights.  A different kind of fauna  Contrary to what many people think, there are no polar bears in Iceland. Admittedly, every ten years or so a polar bear may arrive as an accidental tourist on an ice flow from Greenland, However, they aren\'t invited to stay. The Arctic fox is the only native mammal. Reindeer live in the wild in east Iceland, but were only imported in the 18th century. Mink have also adapted to the wild, the descendants of animals which escaped from fur farms in the 1930s. A number of pedigree animal stocks are only found in Iceland. Many of these rare breeds have disappeared elsewhere and are the original decedents brought over by the Vikings, including the Icelandic horse, cow, sheep and sheepdog. Marine mammals are also found in abundance along the coasts, especially minke whale, humpback whale, fin whale and several species of seals. Some whale watching tour operators claim 98% success rates for sightings.

However, I don\'t think I would have otherwise. BUT I am really glad that I did. I loved this movie! I really liked the story line and it also gave me a brief glimpse of the history of Cuba. That in itself made it one of my new favorite movies. Combine this with the music and the awesome dancing and it becomes a fantastic movie. I am not going to compare it to the first DD movie. It deserves to be set out on it\'s own. It is definitely worthy. The young actors do an awesome job of portraying the characters in this movie.

It was really good. Yes it was a chick flick and a teen movie, but it was SO good and romantic! Javier (Luna) was SO hot and good. The way his body moved was amazing! The only reason I rated this movie a 9 was because I didn\'t like the way it ended. I thought it could have been done a little differently. But I still went out and bought the DVD!! This may sound a little crazy, but almost every night I watch it! If I could learn to dance the way they do...I would pay to learn how to dance so Cuban!

The mix of drama, romance, history, and dance is perfect! The acting, dancing, and music in the movie was great! You want to just stand up and dance (even if you have no idea how to) Havana nights really takes you into the lives of these two people and makes you really care about them. It has an ending that is very true to real life. That things don\'t always go as they should. It had a Romeo and Juliet vibe without being cheesy what so ever. Diego and Romola give a heart warming performance that makes you always want to come back for more.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.

The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War,  First Iraq War, or Iraq War  before the term "Iraq War" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also referred to in the U.S. as "Operation Iraqi Freedom").   The Iraqi Army\'s occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council. U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition, the largest military alliance since World War II. The great majority of the Coalition\'s military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.   The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the U.S. network CNN.    The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm.    The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, continuing for five weeks. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The Coalition ceased its advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia\'s border. Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.  Terminology  The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:  *Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries. A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous, having now been applied to at least three conflicts: see Gulf War (disambiguation). The use of the term Persian Gulf (as opposed to Arabian Gulf) is also disputed: see Persian Gulf naming dispute. With no consensus of naming, various publications have attempted to refine the name. Some variants include:  **Gulf War (e.g. The Gulf War, BBC television series, 2005; Modern Conflicts: The Gulf War, Discovery Channel DVD set, 2010)  **Persian Gulf War (e.g. Encyclopedia of the Persian Gulf War, Mark Grossman, 1995; An Operational Analysis of the Persian Gulf War, U.S. Army War College, 2016)  **Gulf War (1990–1991) (e.g. The Gulf War 1991 (Essential Histories), Alastair Finlan, 2003; Gulf War, 1990-91, William Thomas Allison, 2012)  **First Gulf War (to distinguish it from the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent Iraq War) (e.g. Gulf War One: Real Voices from the Front Line, Hugh McManners, 2010)  **Second Gulf War (to distinguish it from the Iran–Iraq War) (e.g. Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State Building and Regime Security, Mohammad-Mahmoud Mohamedou, 1997)  *Liberation of Kuwait () (taḥrīr al-kuwayt) is the term used by Kuwait and most of the Coalition\'s Arab states including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.  *Other language terms include  and  (Gulf War);  (Second | Question: August 2, 1990 saw Iraq invading what country, sparking a series of events that culminated in the 1st Gulf War?', ['kuwait', 'kuw', 'state of kuwait', 'kuwaitis'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7703'), ("Context: The ancient Sanskrit epics the Ramayana and Mahabharata comprise together the Itihāsa ( `` History '' ) or Mahākāvya ( `` Great Compositions '' ) , a canon of Hindu scripture .

From Everybody:  "The Little Family Just Got Bigger."  Plot:  Eleanor Little (Geena Davis) and Frederick Little (Hugh Laurie) and their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) are intending an adoption. While George is at school, his parents go to an orphanage where they meet and fall in love with a humanoid mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Despite misgivings from Mrs. Keeper (Julia Sweeney), they adopt Stuart and take him home. However, Stuart is greeted coldly by George, who refuses to acknowledge the mouse as his brother, and the family cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane), who is disgusted at having a mouse for a "master". Despite Eleanor and Frederick\'s intentions, Stuart quickly feels like an outsider in the large Little family, especially when the family\'s unknowing relatives bring Stuart large presents and George snaps at his family, claiming out loud that Stuart is not his brother. When Stuart admits his feelings of loneliness to his parents, they ask Mrs. Keeper to do some background research on Stuart\'s biological family.After accidentally stumbling across George\'s playroom in the basement, Stuart finally bonds with George when they play together and plan to finish George\'s remote controlled boat, the Wasp, for an upcoming boat race in Central Park. At the same time, however, one of Snowbell\'s alley cat friends, Monty (voiced by Steve Zahn) visits unexpectedly and discovers Stuart. Determined not to have his reputation destroyed, Snowbell meets with Monty\'s leader, Smokey (voiced by Chazz Palminteri), a mafia don-like alley cat, and plans to have Stuart removed from the household without harming him.Stuart and George finish the Wasp in time for the race, but on the day of the race, the control is smashed when a bystander accidentally steps on it. Stuart pilots the Wasp himself, but ends up in a tussle with a larger boat belonging to George\'s rival, Anton, who has already smashed the rest of the boats without being disqualified. Stuart snaps the wires of Anton\'s boat and manages to win the race, at the same time finally winning George\'s acceptance and respect. During the family celebration, however, the Little\'s are visited by a mouse couple, Reginald and Camille Stout (voiced by Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly), who claim to be Stuart\'s parents who gave him up to the orphanage years ago due to poverty. Reluctantly, Stuart leaves with the Stouts, George presenting him with his toy car as a farewell gift. A few days later, however, Mrs. Keeper comes to visit and tells the Little\'s that Stuart\'s parents actually died many years ago in a supermarket accident. Realizing their son has been kidnapped, the Little\'s call the police and stick posters of Stuart\'s face across the city.Meanwhile, Snowbell meets with Smokey and the alley cats: he had actually conspired with them to have the Stouts pose as Stuart\'s parents in order to remove Stuart from the household. Fearing retribution should the Little\'s discover Snowbell\'s deception, Smokey orders the Stouts to hand Stuart over to them, but the Stouts, having grown to truly love Stuart, tell him to flee. Smokey subsequently orders a manhunt for Stuart. They corner him in Central Park and a chase ensues. Despite losing his car and almost falling down a storm drain, Stuart manages to evade Smokey and return home, unfortunately, while the Little\'s are out putting posters up. The only one present is Snowbell, who lies that the Little\'s have been enjoying themselves greatly since Stuart\'s departure, and uses Stuart\'s removed face from the family photograph as proof (which they had actually used for the posters). Heartbroken, Stuart leaves again, but Snowbell begins to question his actions when he sees the pain the Little\'s are going through.The alley cats locate Stuart in Central Park and bring Snowbell for the hunt.

It was not envisaged for European Union measures, that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions, to be subject to human rights. At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights, hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights. The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent. In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union draws a list of fundamental rights from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties. | Question: Which entities were originally concerned with preventing violation of human rights?", ['the European Convention on Human Rights', 'the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights', 'member states'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4118'), ("Context: Computer hardware includes the physical , tangible parts or components of a computer , such as the central processing unit , monitor , keyboard , computer data storage , graphic card , sound card , speakers and motherboard .

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

In May and June, the Cactus bears                   creamy white flowers with yellow centers that                   measured about three inches. The Saguaro Cactus                   flower can be found on the end of the branches. The                   flower only opens on cooler nights and is closed                   during the heat of midday. The stem of the cactus                   can be 18 to 24 inches in diameter, The Cactus and                   its branches grow upright as do all cacti in the                   southwestern U.S. When it rains the Saguaro Cactus                   soaks up water and holds it in its ribs. Since it                   does not rain a lot in the desert, the cactus uses                   the water that it stores when it doesn\'t rain. The                   Saguaro Cactus is Arizona\'s state flower. The                   average lifespan for a Saguaro cactus is about 200                   years.  The Saguaro                   Cactus lives in an especially rocky terrain                   consisting of desert slopes and flats. The Saguaro                   cactus also lives in bajadas or lowlands. The                   cactus likes a hot, dry climate. It does not need a                   lot of water to survive. The Saguaro Cactus lives                   only within the Sonoran Desert of                   southeastern  California, southern Arizona, and northwestern Mexico. In          the Sonoran Desert, the Saguaro Cactus can grow in very          limited areas below elevations of 3,500 feet.  The Saguaro Cactus          can absorb a lot of water because the ribs on the plant can          expand. The Saguaro Cactus has an amazing root system. The          root system is very shallow for such a tall, heavy plant.          The Saguaro Cactus has one tap root that is only about three          feet long. It also has two sets of radial roots. One is a          thick root system, which is only about one foot long, and          there is also a thinner root system that grows to a length          equal to the height of the Saguaro Cactus.  The Saguaro Cactus          has a very strong framework consisting of three different          structural features. There is a woody tissue that runs          parallel up and down the Saguaro to form a cylindrical          shape. There is also a thick whitish pith, and a fleshy          tissue. Downward pointing spines make it easier to direct          rainwater into the depressions of the cactus. The spines          help to cool the outer skin. The spines also help redirect          the wind and insulate the plant. Many animals eat the          Saguaro Cactus; the Long-Nosed bat, bees, wasps, ants, and          butterflies drink the nectar of the Cactus flower. Small          animals such as the Pack Rat, and Pocket Mice will come to          eat the Cactus. Gila woodpeckers like the interior of the          Saguaro Cactus because it is the only plant it can hollow          out for their nest in the desert. The woodpecker will drill          2 to 3 holes before it decides to live in one. It will peck          right into the soft tissue that is used to store water. The          cactus will fix the damage by sealing up the inside with          "callous scar tissue" and that stops water loss. The Saguaro          Cactus is protected by the United States government, because          the Saguaro Cactus was beginning to disappear from the          landscape. There is a national park to protect the Saguaro          Cactus.

ABSV—June 2005 e.v.  For those who enter the Golden Dawn without prior exposure to the Hebrew language, the memorization of these 22 letters upon which the Qabalistic tradition of Western mysticism and magick rests may seem a most insurmountable chore. Coupled with the apparently foreign names and spheres of the Qabalistic Sephiroth, the Neophyte might be half-ready to throw up her hands in defeat. Perhaps Hebrew “is all Greek” to her, but the Neophyte need only rest assured that many have encountered this challenge before her, and in divers ways and paths they have climbed their way through what may seem now like an impossible task but, by and by, becomes as if second nature. In the hopes of helping the Neophyte find her way through this morass, I would like to offer the method by which I learned the Hebrew alephbet–for I too had no prior knowledge of these letters before encountering them in magick.  My mnemonic for learning the Hebrew letters consisted of two parts:  Comparing (and contrasting) the Hebrew alephbet with the English alphabet.  Knowing the Hebrew letters’ attributions to the Tarot trumps.  The second was particularly useful for me only because I had been working with the Tarot years before I had to learn any Hebrew letters. But as that is harder to generalize–and in any case, the Initiate will be learning all Tarot-Hebrew correspondences in the Fourth Knowledge Lecture–I would like to focus on the former method. Regardless of what method one uses, I believe that the knack to memorizing any hefty amount of knowledge–and this, it goes without saying, is something worth keeping in mind for future knowledge lectures, rituals, prayers, invocations, ad nauseam–is to divide it into clusters, study each independently, and then synthesize the entirety of that knowledge at the end.  Let us first write out the Hebrew alephbet in its proper order: Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Heh, Vau, Zayin, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Kaph, Lamed, Mem, Nu, Samekh, Ayin, Peh, Tzaddi, Qoph, Resh, Shin, Tau.  And let us hold in our minds the letters of the English alphabet.  We should have no problem learning the first four Hebrew letters: Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth. One need only sing, “A, B, C, D,” (with C for Gimel) or if familiar with Greek to recall its first four letters: “Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta.” Now if we search the Hebrew letters for the next cluster resembling the English alphabet, we see that it is Kaph, Lamed, Mem, Nu–which is simply “K, L, M, N.” Go down a little further and the next–and last–cluster that resembles English is Peh, (Tzaddi), Qoph, Resh, Shin, Tau–which is simply “P, Q, R, S, T” with an easily memorized exception.  Now we have split up the Hebrew alephbet into five clusters as follows:  1. Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth – sim. “A, B, C, D”  *2. Heh, Vau, Zayin, Cheth, Teth, Yod  3. Kaph, Lamed, Mem, Nun – sim. “K, L, M, N”  *4. Samekh, Ayin  5. Peh, Tzaddi, Qoph, Resh, Shin, Tau – sim. “P, –, Q, R, S, T”  The two clusters with asterisks are those on which the Neophyte should focus her attention, for as we now see, she is already familiar with clusters 1, 3, and 5 by merit of her knowledge of English.

Cauliflower can be prepared in many different ways; it can be boiled, steamed, roasted or fried. \xa0It is also a great substitute for potatoes. Boiled and mashed they have the same texture as mashed potatoes, but without all the carbs, as they lack the starch of potatoes.  Cauliflower saw its peak of popularity way back in the 1600’s and 1700’s in France, after being introduced by the Romans.

The term oleracea refers to a vegetable garden herb that is used in cooking, while botrytis is a Greek word meaning “clusterlike” or “grapelike.” The English word cauliflower comes from the Latin words caulis, meaning “stem” or “cabbage,” and flos, “flower.”  General Information  Cauliflower, like its cousin broccoli, is a member of the cabbage family, and it took centuries of cultivation to produce a tight head of clustered flower buds in place of the compact leaves of the cabbage head. Thousands of tiny white flower buds are closely packed into even larger buds, forming the florets that make up the single large round head or “flower.” Cauliflower was introduced into medieval Europe by the Arabs during their occupation of Spain, and by the twelfth century Spaniards were eating as many as three varieties of the vegetable. In sixteenth-century England, cauliflower was called “Cyprus coleworts,” probably because it was first imported from the island of Cyprus. A new green variety has been developed commercially that is a cross between conventional cauliflower and broccoli. The head resembles cauliflower, but the color is chartreuse, rather than the dark green of broccoli.

The Laughing Kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) is a carnivorous bird in the kingfisher subfamily Halcyoninae. Native to eastern mainland Australia, it has also been introduced to parts of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Western Australia. Male and female adults are similar in plumage, which is predominantly brown and white. A common and familiar bird, this species of kookaburra is well known for its laughing call. The species was previously known as the Laughing Jackass and Giant Kingfisher. They live in close family groups where the young male offspring are driven out near maturity and the females usually stay on and assist the breeding adults in raising the new young by defending and feeding.

Additional information added by Avianweb  The Laughing Kookaburras (Dacelo novaeguineae) are Australian kingfishers that were named for their laughing calls.  In the past, it has been given the nicknames, the “Laughing Jackass” and the “Giant Kingfisher.” Its name comes from the Aboriginal language of the extinct Wiradhuri tribe.  Kookaburras occupy open woodland territories, forests and land on the edges of plains. It is the largest member of the Kingfisher family.  \xa0  Distribution and Habitat  The Laughing Kookaburras are indigenous to the woodlands of Eastern\xa0 mainland Australia , but they have also been introduced to Western Australia, Tasmania ,\xa0Flinders Island, Kangaroo Island , and New Zealand .  The Laughing Kookaburra prefers the mature trees in the woodlands, especially in the dry eucalyptus forests; however, it is a frequent guest in urban parks and gardens. Its territory is based on the availability of a consistent food supply and safe nesting sites.  Kookaburras can live 10 to 12 years in the wild, and they are not threatened or\xa0endangered.\xa0They remain in their territories year-round.  \xa0  Description  A familiar bird in its habitats, the Laughing Kookaburra is easily identifiable by its plumage, mainly shades of brown and white. This makes for excellent camouflage to protect it from its predators and hide it from its prey. Its head and bill are both large, and its eyes are brown. Its stocky, solidly built body is about 45 cm (18 in) long, from beak to tail, making it one of the most sizeable species in the Kingfisher family. The boat-shaped bill is bi-colored; the maxilla, or top part, is blue, and the lower part, or mandible, is a pale pink.  The sexes are dimorphic yet very similar. The female is larger than the male, and her rump contains fewer blue markings than the male’s. The body is cream-colored, and there is a dark brown stripe running through each eye and across the top of the beige-colored head. Another brown stripe runs from the eye to the back of the head on the side. Both the back and the wings are brown, although the wings include sparkling sky-blue markings on the shoulders. The tail is rufous reddish-orange with dark brown bars and white tips on the feathers.  The Laughing Kookaburra’s breast is filled with pale gray, wavy lines, and the outsides of the wings are covered with a scattering of blue markings. The male Laughing Kookaburra’s rump is often blue. The female is slightly larger than the male.  \xa0  Vocalizations  The name "Laughing Kookaburra | Question: "In Australia, what is known as a ""Laughing Jackass""?" ?', ['kookaburra', 'dacelo'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3486'), ("Context: Steve Carell as Felonious Gru , the former villain turned Anti-Villain League agent , Margo , Edith , and Agnes ' adoptive father , and Lucy 's husband .

By the terms of the lease, signed in June 1856, the city of Paris granted the French racing authorities 60 hectares at Longchamp (from 1st July 1856 to 30 June 1906).  The Hippodrome of Longchamp  On 15 December 1856, the State accorded "Société d\'Encouragement" the right to run the "Autumn" race series hitherto held at the Champs-de-Mars under the management of Haras.  The first ever race was run at Longchamp on Sunday 27 April 1857 in front of a massive crowd. The Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Eugénie were present, having sailed down the Seine on their private yacht to watch the third race. Until 1930, many Parisians came to the track down the river on steamboats and various other vessels, the trip taking around an hour to the Pont de Suresnes.  The royal couple joined Prince Jerome Bonaparte and his son Prince Napoleon in the Royal Enclosure alongside the Prince of Nassau, Prince Murat and the Duke of Morny, an avid racegoer. Non-aristocratic members of the upper classes were not permitted into the Royal enclosure and had to be content with watching from their barouche carriages on the lawn.  Charabancs, Victoria carriages and paddle boats all brought Parisians to Longchamp. And they came as much for a day out as from curiosity for this new form of entertainment.  The card for the opening day contained five races. The first horse ever to cross the finishing line was Eclaireur, in the black and red colors of Auguste Lupin. A short length behind was Miss Gladiator, destined, a few years later, to become one of the most famous brood mares in French racing history when she foaled the celebrated Gladiator, whose bronze statue still stands at the main entrance to the racetrack.

So, in a strict sense, a private school is an unaided independent school. For the purpose of this definition, only receipt of financial aid is considered, not land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate. It is within the power of both the union government and the state governments to govern schools since Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution.

Before he changed the music industry with songs like "Ring of Fire" and "Folsom Prison Blues," Johnny Cash spent his hardscrabble childhood in the small community of Dyess, Arkansas.  The Johnny Cash Boyhood Home, the newest of Arkansas State University\'s Heritage Sites, opens Saturday for public tours after a restoration project that includes other historic buildings.  When visitors walk into the home, they are stepping back into the 1930s.  Cash family artifacts original to the home include the piano that belonged to Johnny\'s mother, his father\'s shaving mug and even the original flooring in his childhood bedroom and the living room. The living room linoleum still has burn marks caused by the wood-burning stove.  Other furnishings and objects are of the time period and mostly contributed by donors, said Ruth Hawkins, director of Arkansas Heritage Sites at Arkansas State University. They are based on the photos and memories of Tommy Cash and Joanne Cash Yates, two of Johnny Cash\'s siblings.  Period details include a pedestal sewing machine, a battery-operated radio like one Johnny Cash would play at night and the living-room sofa. The period icebox and corner cabinet were painted the apple-green color the siblings remember.  The Dyess Colony was a federal agricultural resettlement community created in 1934, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s New Deal program in response to the Great Depression.  The colony provided homes and jobs for about 500 poor farm families, including the Cash family.  Johnny, called JR at the time, was 3 years old when his family moved into a Dyess home in 1935.  Johnny spent his childhood in Dyess, attending school and church in the town. He also suffered an enormous loss when his brother Jack was killed in a sawmill accident in 1944.  Cash left "JR" behind and became Johnny when he left Arkansas for the Air Force in 1950.  Arkansas was an important influence on Cash, who told audiences how "Five Feet High and Rising" and many of his other songs were influenced by his time living in Dyess.  "The little church in Dyess, Arkansas, has been such an inspiration to me, and (so have) the people from Dyess," Cash said at the 40th reunion of Dyess High School in 1990, in a video exhibited at the Dyess Colony Museum.  Cash died in 2003, leaving four daughters from his first marriage to Vivian Liberto. Cash and his second wife, singer June Carter Cash, had a son together. June Carter Cash died earlier in 2003.  The annual Johnny Cash Music Festival , which starts on Friday in nearby Jonesboro, has raised almost $2 million to fund the restoration project. Headliners for this year\'s sold-out festival include Reba McEntire, Bobby Bare and Loretta Lynn, who are donating their performances, as have artists in previous years.  With the restoration of Cash\'s childhood home and nearby Dyess Colony Administration Building complete, work has already begun on the restoration of the historic Dyess Theatre adjacent to the administration building, to be used as a visitor center.  In his 1997 autobiography, "Cash," he credited his state with inspiring his music. "Back in Arkansas, a way of life produced a certain kind of music."

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal\'s USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s.

They called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the name, whose precise origin is contested, nevertheless indicates the chief source of their inspiration. Disenchanted with contemporary academic painting—most of them were colleagues at the Royal Academy of Art and famously disparaged the Academy’s founding president, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), as “Sir Sloshua”—the Brotherhood instead emulated the art of late medieval and early Renaissance Europe until the time of Raphael, an art characterized by minute description of detail, a luminous palette of bright colors that recalls the tempera paint used by medieval artists, and subject matter of a noble, religious, or moralizing nature. In mid-nineteenth-century England, a period marked by political upheaval, mass industrialization, and social ills, the Brotherhood at its inception strove to transmit a message of artistic renewal and moral reform by imbuing their art with seriousness, sincerity, and truth to nature.  At London’s Royal Academy and Free Exhibition shows of 1849, several paintings were exhibited with the cryptic initials “P.R.B.” along with the artists’ signatures; among these were Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother, Slain in a Skirmish between the Colonna and Orsini Factions (private collection) by William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Isabella (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) by John Everett Millais (1829–1896), and the Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate, London) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). These canvases, though diverse in subject, embodied the Brotherhood’s initial aims in their keen observation of the natural world and depiction of subjects that lead the viewer to contemplate moral issues of justice, piety, familial relationships, and the struggle of purity against corruption.  Hunt’s work illustrates a passage from a popular Victorian novel, set in fourteenth-century Rome, by Bulwer Lytton, and is characterized by a careful description of the outdoor setting. Millais’ Isabella is based on John Keats’ retelling of a story from Boccaccio’s Decameron; the artist re-creates in sumptuous detail the tastes and textures of a medieval banquet, from the creased tablecloth strewn with nutshells to guests at the grandly arrayed gathering. In his portrayal of the life of the Virgin, Rossetti employs an archaizing style and symbolic elements associated with early Renaissance painting: the lily , representing purity, the dove of the Holy Spirit, and the cruciform trellis. Other founding members of the Brotherhood—James Collinson (1825–1881; he resigned after converting to Catholicism in 1850), William Michael Rossetti (1829–1919), Frederic George Stephens (1827–1907), and the sculptor Thomas Woolner (1825–1892)—exhibited less frequently than its three prolific leading members.  The works of the Pre-Raphaelites met with critical opposition to their pietism, archaizing compositions, intensely sharp focus—which, with an absence of shadows, flattened the depicted forms—and the stark coloration they achieved by painting on a wet white ground. They had, however, several important champions.
