It is a price-weighted index comprised of Japan's top 225 blue-chip companies traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange . The Nikkei is equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the United States.  BREAKING DOWN 'Nikkei'  Originally called the Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average (from 1975 to 1985), it is now named for the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" or Japan Economic Newspaper, commonly known as Nikkei, which sponsors the calculation of the index. The index has been calculated since September 1950, retroactive to May 1949. Among the best-known companies included in the Nikkei index are Canon Inc., Sony Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation. It is the oldest stock index in Asia.  The Nikkei was established as part of the rebuilding and industrialization of Japan in the aftermath of the Second World War. Constituent stocks are ranked by share price, rather than by market capitalization as is common in most indexes. Valuations are denominated in Japanese yen. The composition of the Nikkei is reviewed every September, and any needed changes take place in October.  Background  The Tokyo Stock Exchange was established in 1878. In 1943, during the Second World War, the Japanese government combined the TSE with five others to form a single Japanese Stock Exchange. That exchange was closed down in August 1945, near the end of the war. The Tokyo Stock Exchange re-opened on May 16, 1949 under the aegis of the new Securities Exchange Act .  Japan experienced a major asset bubble in the late 1980's, as the government used fiscal and monetary stimuli to counteract a recession caused by the Japanese yen's 50% appreciation during the first part of the decade. Stock prices and land values tripled between 1985 and 1989; at the height of the bubble, the TSE accounted for 60% of global stock market capitalization. The bubble burst in 1990, and the value of the Nikkei Index fell by one-third that year. In October 2008, the Nikkei traded below 7,000; this was a decline of more than 80% from its December 1989 high. It subsequently rebounded strongly, rising 150% between June 2012 and June 2015 with the help of economic stimulus from the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan . This was still nearly 50% below the 1989 high.  Investing in the Nikkei Index  It is not possible to directly purchase an index, but there are several Exchange Traded Funds whose components correlate to the Nikkei. ETFs that track it and trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange include Blackrock Japan's iShares Nikkei 225 and Nomura Asset Management 's Nikkei 225 Exchange Traded Fund. The MAXIS Nikkei 225 Index ETF is a dollar-denominated fund that trades on the New York Stock Exchange .  Trading Center | Question: What is the Japanese share index called?

08/15/2021 15:45:50 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Leaves of GrassLeaves of Grass is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass,  revising it multiple times until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400.  The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected, with each representing Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.  With one exception, the poems do not rhyme or follow standard rules for meter and line length. Among the poems in the collection are "Song of Myself", "I Sing the Body Electric", "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking". Later editions included Whitman's elegy to the assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd".  Leaves of Grass was highly controversial during its time for its explicit sexual imagery, and Whitman was subject to derision by many contemporary critics. Over time, the collection has infiltrated popular culture and been recognized as one of the central works of American poetry.  Publication history and origin  Initial publication  Leaves of Grass has its genesis in an essay called The Poet by Ralph Waldo Emerson, published in 1844, which expressed the need for the United States to have its own new and unique poet to write about the new country's virtues and vices. Whitman, reading the essay, consciously set out to answer Emerson's call as he began work on the first edition of Leaves of Grass. Whitman, however, downplayed Emerson's influence, stating, "I was simmering, simmering, simmering; Emerson brought me to a boil".   On May 15, 1855, Whitman registered the title Leaves of Grass with the clerk of the United States District Court, Southern District of New Jersey, and received its copyright.Kaplan, 198 The first edition was published in Brooklyn at the printing shop of two Scottish immigrants, James and Andrew Rome, whom Whitman had known since the 1840s,  on July 4, 1855. The shop was located at Fulton Street (now Cadman Plaza West) and Cranberry Street, now the site of apartment buildings that bear Whitman's name.  Whitman paid for and did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself. The book did not include the author's name, instead offering an engraving by Samuel Hollyer depicting Whitman in work clothes and a jaunty hat, arms at his side.Callow, 227 Early advertisements for the first edition appealed to "lovers of literary curiosities" as an oddity.  Sales on the book were few but Whitman was not discouraged.  The first edition was very small, collecting only twelve unnamed poems in 95 pages.Loving, 179 Whitman once said he intended the book to be small enough to be carried in a pocket. "That would tend to induce people to take me along with them and read me in the open air: I am nearly always successful with the reader in the open air", he explained.Reynolds, 352 About 800 were printed,  though only 200 were bound in its trademark green cloth cover. The only American library known to have purchased a copy of the first edition was in Philadelphia.  The poems of the first edition, which were given titles in later issues, were "Song of Myself", "A Song for Occupations | Question: "Who wrote ""Leaves of Grass""?" ?

It is the largest lake in Central America and one of the very few, or perhaps the only, freshwater lake to have sharks, although their numbers have dropped precipitously.  The adventurous are rewarded by the splendor of volcanoes, jungle villages, placid lakes, and pristine beaches, untouched islands, like you'll find boating in Lago de Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America and home to rare freshwater sharks. Or perhaps you'll discover a remote surf break on the southwestern Pacific coast.  Largest Lake In Central America Nicaragua is home to the largest lake in Central America locally known as Cocibolca or Lake Nicaragua. Nearly 20% of the total landmass of Nicaragua is set aside in 78 different National Parks and protected areas.  People considered digging a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama-if they had used Nicaragua, they would have dug a canal to Lake Nicaragua (the largest lake in Central America), then another one away from it. Instead, it was dug through the Isthmus of Panama.  The largest Central American nation, Nicaragua, is full of parks and reserves and more lakes than any other Central American nation. Located between Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south and with long coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, Nicaragua is about one-third tropical rainforests and is split in half by a mountain range scattered with volcanoes.  Also known as La Mar Dulce (the Sweet Sea), Lake Nicaragua is the largest lake in Central America and the tenth largest freshwater lake in the world. Forty-five rivers flow into the lake and it is home to the worlds only species of freshwater shark.  The lake is connected to the Caribbean Sea by the San Juan River, historically making the lakeside city of Granada, Nicaragua an Atlantic port although it is closer to the Pacific. The lake has a history of Caribbean pirates which assaulted nearby Granada on three occasions.[1]. Despite draining into the Caribbean Sea, the Pacific Ocean is near enough to be seen from the mountains of Ometepe.  Before construction of the Panama Canal, a stagecoach line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company connected the lake with the Pacific across the low hills of the narrow Isthmus of Rivas. Plans were made to take advantage of this route to build an interoceanic canal, the Nicaragua Canal, but the Panama Canal was built instead. In order to quell competition with the Panama Canal, the U.S. secured all rights to a canal along this route in the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty of 1916. However, the idea of another canal in Nicaragua still periodically resurfaces. Ecocanal is one of these projects.

As the heir to a major European banking business, he used his family’s vast wealth to fund painters, sculptors, and architects, helping Florence emerge as a cultural center and spurring the Renaissance at great personal cost. He led the city-state as a despot, using everything from friendship to threats to secure and maintain his power. He cared greatly about Florence’s success, even putting himself in harm’s way to settle conflicts with rivals.  "I do not regret [spending 663,000 florins for charity, buildings, and taxes] for though many would consider it better to have a part of that sum in their purse, I consider it to have been a great honor to our state, and I think the money was well-expended and I am well-pleased."  Quoted (1471) in Living on the Edge in Leonardo’s Florence, edited by Gene A. Brucker, 2005, Google Books  Biography  Lorenzo de’ Medici assumed power in the city-state of Florence in 1469. The Medicis were among the foremost bankers in Europe at the time, accumulating great wealth, and they had ruled the republic for years. Lorenzo continued the family tradition of leading as a despot, and he centralized power through strategic friendships, marriages, bribes, and threats.  Despite this strength, Lorenzo’s rule was not unchallenged. In 1478, the Pazzi conspiracy – named for the rival banking family that instigated an attempted coup – tried to assassinate Lorenzo, injuring him and killing his brother. The attempt occurred with the knowledge of the Pope, and when Lorenzo retaliated against the conspirators, the Catholic Church (backed by soldiers from Naples) entered a state of war with Florence.  Lorenzo inspired Florentines to defend their city-state. However, as war dragged on, Lorenzo boldly decided to force peace talks by sailing to Naples personally. There he remained in the king’s hands for three months, until the king – impressed by Lorenzo’s action – agreed to end the violence. Lorenzo used this event to consolidate more power, as he could now argue that he knew the best way to handle threats to Florence.  Meanwhile, Lorenzo became one of the foremost artistic patrons in Florence, and all of Italy. He sponsored Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Sandro Botticelli. This set an example that spurred patronage across Renaissance Italy. de’ Medici also supported humanists, creating a library with classical works from the East. He expanded the Medici library and encouraged the study of classic literature in Florence and across Europe. Although the money he spent meant he left the Medici bank weaker than when he inherited it, he was groundbreaking in his support for the arts.  What Made Lorenzo de' Medici A leader?  Florence was a leading artistic city during the Renaissance, and Lorenzo de’ Medici was one of its most enthusiastic patrons. He set an example for the city to by endorsing several of the period’s leading artists.  Through multiple arrangements and marriages, de’ Medici assured his family of power in the Catholic Church (there were four Medici popes) and across Europe.  Lorenzo’s actions following the Pazzi Conspiracy showed his willingness to take risks on behalf of his people, and once he returned, the Florentine people were willing to follow him even after he used the event to centralize his power.  The Medici banking clan continued its prominence through Lorenzo’s reign, meaning that he did not just lead the city politically, but also economically. He used this money to promote art and architecture, enhancing Florence’s reputation as a cultural center.  Discover More About Lorenzo de' Medici  Keywords  Print  Hibbert, Christopher.

The descendants of his seven sons and five daughters contested the throne for generations, climaxing in the Wars of the Roses (1455–85).  Edward III, watercolour, 15th century; in the British Library (Cotton MS. Julius E. IV).  By permission of the British Library  Early years  The eldest son of Edward II and Isabella of France , Edward III was summoned to Parliament as earl of Chester (1320) and was made duke of Aquitaine (1325), but, contrary to tradition, he never received the title of prince of Wales.  Edward III grew up amid struggles between his father and a number of barons who were attempting to limit the king’s power and to strengthen their own role in governing England. His mother, repelled by her husband’s treatment of the nobles and disaffected by the confiscation of her English estates by his supporters, played an important role in this conflict. In 1325 she left England to return to France to intervene in the dispute between her brother, Charles IV of France, and her husband over the latter’s French possessions, Guyenne , Gascony , and Ponthieu. She was successful; the land was secured for England on condition that the English king pay homage to Charles. This was performed on the king’s behalf by his young son.  United Kingdom: Edward III (1327–77)  The heir apparent was secure at his mother’s side. With Roger Mortimer , an influential baron who had escaped to France in 1323 and had become her lover, Isabella now began preparations to invade England to depose her husband. To raise funds for this enterprise, Edward III was betrothed to Philippa , daughter of William, count of Hainaut and Holland.  Within five months of their invasion of England, the queen and the nobles, who had much popular support, overpowered the king’s forces. Edward II, charged with incompetence and breaking his coronation oath, was forced to resign, and on January 29, 1327, Edward III, aged 14, was crowned king of England.  During the next four years Isabella and Mortimer governed in his name, though nominally his guardian was Henry, earl of Lancaster . In the summer of 1327 he took part in an abortive campaign against the Scots, which resulted in the Treaty of Northampton (1328), making Scotland an independent realm. Edward was deeply troubled by the settlement and signed it only after much persuasion by Isabella and Mortimer. He married Philippa at York on January 24, 1328. Soon afterward Edward made a successful effort to throw off his degrading dependence on his mother and Mortimer. While a council was being held at Nottingham, he entered the castle by night, through a subterranean passage, took Mortimer prisoner, and had him executed (November 1330). Edward had discreetly ignored his mother’s liaison with Mortimer and treated her with every respect, but her political influence was at an end.  Britannica Stories  Cheetahs Face Extinction Risk  Edward III now began to rule as well as to reign. Young, ardent , and active, he sought to remake England into the powerful nation it had been under Edward I . He still resented the concession of independence made to Scotland by the Treaty of Northampton. The death of Robert I , the Bruce, king of Scotland, in 1329 gave him a chance of retrieving his position. The new king of Scots, his brother-in-law, David II , was a mere boy, and Edward took advantage of his weakness to aid the Scottish barons who had been exiled by Bruce to place their leader, Edward Balliol, on the Scottish throne.

Mammy Two Shoes (sometimes Mrs. Two Shoes) is a recurring character in MGM 's Tom and Jerry cartoons. She is a heavy-set middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters.  As a partially seen character , she was famous for never showing her face (except very briefly in Saturday Evening Puss ). Mammy's appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. It was later revealed that her character was greatly inspired by Oscar -winning black actress and singer Hattie McDaniel , best known for playing "Mammy" in MGM and David O. Selznick 's 1939 film Gone with the Wind .  A character very similar to Mammy Two Shoes had earlier been portrayed in the Disney Silly Symphonies shorts Three Orphan Kittens and More Kittens , as well as the Pluto short Pantry Pirate and the Figaro short Figaro and Cleo . A similar character Aunt Petunia the Mammy actually shows her face which resembles blackface in The Little Audrey Cartoon Series .  Contents  7 References    Theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoons    Mammy Two Shoes, in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , whose full face was shown for the first time.  Mammy first appeared in Puss Gets the Boot , the first Tom and Jerry cartoon (except Tom was called "Jasper"). She always referred to Tom as his given name Thomas and almost always used "is" in conjunction with a pronoun ("is you" and "I is"). The character went on to make many appearances through the entire series until 1952 and her last appearance in the short, Push-Button Kitty . William Hanna and Joseph Barbera initially portrayed Mammy as the maid of the house, with the real owners unknown to us. Later, Hanna and Barbera seemed to suggest, through dialogue and occasional behavior, that the house was Mammy's own.  Mammy was originally voiced by well-known African-American character actress Lillian Randolph . In the 1960s, the MGM animation studio , by then under the supervision of Chuck Jones , created censored versions of the Tom & Jerry cartoons featuring Mammy for television. These versions used rotoscoping techniques to replace Mammy on-screen with a similarly stocky white woman (in most shorts) or a thin white woman (in Saturday Evening Puss); Randolph's voice on the soundtracks was replaced by an Irish-accented (or, in Puss, generic young adult) voice performed by white actress June Foray . [1]  The original versions of the cartoons were reinstated when Turner Broadcasting acquired ownership of the Tom & Jerry property. But in 1992, the cartoons featuring Mammy were edited again; this time, to replace Lillian Randolph's voice with that of Thea Vidale , who re-recorded the dialogue to remove Mammy's use of potentially offensive dialect . These re-recorded versions of the cartoons are aired to this day on Turner's Cartoon Network -related cable channels, and have at times turned up on DVD as well. However, some European TV showings of these cartoons, especially the UK, retain Randolph's original voice. The Region 2 Complete Collectors Edition DVD boxset has Vidale's voice on the first DVD and Randolph in a number of the episodes after that (such as A Mouse in the House and Mouse Cleaning ).    Replacement characters for Mammy  From 1954's Pet Peeve , Mammy disappeared from Tom and Jerry; the owners of the animals' house became a young, white, middle-class couple named Joan and George , and starting with 1955's The Flying Sorceress , the audience was able to see these owners' heads.

Alan Minter won his next five boxing fights, three by knockout, before tasting defeat for the first time after the referee stopped the fight in the eighth round to King George Aido due to bad cuts suffered by Alan Minter. Two more wins followed before facing Jan Magziarz, who beat him twice in a row again due to cuts.  1974 was a diverse year for Alan  Minter, defeating Tony Byrne by a result in eight, losing in two to  Ricky Torres again on cuts, having a third fight with Magziarz result in  a no boxing fight in four rounds and closing the year with a win in  eight rounds by result in his first worldwide fight, against Shako Mamba  in Hamburg, Germany.In 1975, he won four fights in a row, including another boxing bout in Hamburg and, by the end of the year, he challenged Kevin Finnegan for the British boxing Middleweight title, captivating it by a 15 round decision. In 1976 he won six fights, to extend his streak to ten successive wins.These wins gave Alan Minter a status among the top ten boxing Middleweight challengers.  In 1977, he won the European boxing Middleweight title by beating Germano Valsecchi by a knockout in five in Italy. But in his next boxing fight his winning line ended when he lost to former world title challenger Ronnie Harris by a knockout in eight. Alan Minter returned to top ten contender status by upsetting the former World Welterweight and Light Middleweight Champion Emile Griffith with a ten round decision win in Monte Carlo, but then he lost his European title to Gratien Tonna by a knockout in eight at Milan. He closed '77 with a third 15 round decision win over Finnegan to retain his British title.  1978 was a bad year for Alan Minter, even though he won all three of his boxing bouts. On 15 February, at the Muhammad Ali vs Leon Spinks I undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, he won his first bout in the United States by knocking out Sandy Torres in five. Then, he went to Italy once once more to get back his European Middleweight title by knocking out Angelo Jacopucci in twelve rounds. Jacopucci died a few days afterwards, due to injuries sustained in the bout. Alan Minter completed his year by avenging his loss to Tonna with a six round boxing knockout.  In 1979, Alan Minter won all four of his boxing fights, two of them by knockout. On 16 March 1980, in Las Vegas, he was given a attempt at World Middleweight Boxing Champion Vito Antuofermo's title at the Caesars Palace. He won the title by a 15 round result and, in a rematch, he retained the world title by a TKO in eight rounds. Alan Minter's run as world boxing champion came to an end on 27 September of that year, when he was stopped on cuts in three rounds to Marvin Hagler at Wembley Arena in London. After the fight was stopped, Alan Minter's followers caused a riot, throwing beer cans into the boxing ring and both boxers had to be ushered away by the police. Earlier to the fight, Alan Minter made the obviously racist statement on the BBC that, "that black man is not going to take my title away."

The individual who holds the office is the most senior Minister of the Crown, the leader of the Cabinet and the chairperson of the National Security Committee. The office is not mentioned in the Constitution of Australia and exists only through an unwritten political convention and tradition. Despite this, in practice it is the most powerful political position in Australia. The individual who holds the office is commissioned by the Governor-General of Australia.  Almost always and according to convention, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party or largest party in a coalition of parties in the House of Representatives. However, there is no constitutional requirement that the prime minister sit in the House of Representatives, or even be a member of parliament, though by convention this is always the case. The only case where a member of the Senate was appointed prime minister was John Gorton, who subsequently resigned his Senate position and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives (Senator George Pearce was acting prime minister for seven months in 1916 while Billy Hughes was overseas).   Malcolm Turnbull has held the office of Prime Minister since 15 September 2015. He received his commission after replacing Tony Abbott as the leader of the Liberal Party, the dominant party in the Coalition government, following the outcome of the September 2015 Liberal leadership ballot.   Former Prime Ministers continue to be important national figures, and in some cases go on to significant post-prime ministerial careers. Some notable examples have included: Edmund Barton, who was a justice of the High Court; George Reid, Andrew Fisher, Joseph Cook and Stanley Bruce, who were High Commissioners to the United Kingdom; Arthur Fadden, who was Treasurer under another prime minister, Robert Menzies; and Kevin Rudd, who became Julia Gillard's Foreign Minister.  Appointment  The Prime Minister of Australia is appointed by the Governor-General of Australia under Section 64 of the Australian Constitution, which empowers the Governor-General to appoint Ministers of the Crown and requires such Ministers to be members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or become members within three months of the appointment. Before being sworn in as a minister, a person must first be sworn in as a member of the Federal Executive Council if they are not already a member. Membership of the Federal Executive Council entitles the member to the style of The Honourable (usually abbreviated to The Hon) for life, barring exceptional circumstances. The senior members of the Executive Council constitute the Cabinet of Australia.  The Prime Minister is, like other ministers, normally sworn in by the Governor-General and then presented with the commission (Letters patent) of office. When defeated in an election, or on resigning, the Prime Minister is said to "hand in the commission" and actually does so by returning it to the Governor-General. In the event of a Prime Minister dying in office, or becoming incapacitated, the Governor-General can terminate the commission. Ministers hold office "during the pleasure of the Governor-General" (s. 64 of the Constitution of Australia), so theoretically, the Governor-General can dismiss a minister at any time, by notifying them in writing of the termination of their commission; however, his or her power to do so except on the advice of the Prime Minister is heavily circumscribed by convention.  Despite the importance of the office of prime minister, the Constitution does not mention the office by name. The conventions of the Westminster system were thought to be sufficiently entrenched in Australia by the authors of the Constitution that it was deemed unnecessary to detail them. The formal title of the portfolio has always been simply "Prime Minister", except for the period of the Fourth Deakin Ministry (June 1909 to April 1910), when it was known as "Prime Minister (without portfolio)".   If a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or the House passes a vote of "no confidence" in the government, the Prime Minister is | Question: Who is the current Australian prime minister ?

There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.   Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.   The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.   The term "element" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms "elementary substance" and "simple substance" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian простое вещество). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element.  When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such "native elements" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel.  The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900.  The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ("periods") in which the columns ("groups") share recurring ("periodic") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity.

Together with the Egadi, Lipari, Pelagie, and Panteleria islands, Sicily forms an autonomous region of Italy. It lies about 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Tunisia (northern Africa).

Its strategic location at the centre of the Mediterranean has made the island a crossroads of history, a pawn of conquest and empire, and a melting pot for a dozen or more ethnic groups whose warriors or merchants sought its shores. At the coming of the Greeks, three peoples occupied Sicily: in the east the Siculi , or Sicels, who gave their name to the island but were reputed to be latecomers from Italy; to the west of the Gelas River, the Sicani ; and in the extreme west the Elymians , a people to whom a Trojan origin was assigned, with their chief centres at Segesta and at Eryx (Erice). The Siculi spoke an Indo-European language; there are no remains of the languages of the other peoples. There were also Phoenician settlements on the island. The Greeks settled Sicilian towns between the 8th and 6th centuries bce. The mountainous centre remained in the hands of Siculi and Sicani, who were increasingly Hellenized in ideas and material culture .

In 965 the island fell to Arab conquest from North Africa , in 1060 to Normans, who progressively Latinized the island. In the 12th and 13th centuries the island formed a part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (or Naples), and in the 18th century Sicily was ruled by the Bourbons. During the 19th century the island was a major centre of revolutionary movements: in 1860, as a result of Giuseppe Garibaldi’s revolt, it was liberated from the Bourbons and in the following year was incorporated into the united kingdom of Italy. In 1947 Sicily gained regional autonomy .  Mosaic picture of Jesus Christ in the cathedral in Cefalù, Sicily, Italy.

There are six skin types , fair skin that always burn, dark skin that never burns and everything in between.  Melanin is the pigment that determines skin colour as well as hair and eye colour.  Melanin is produced by skin cells when they are exposed to the sun. The more sun exposure, the more melanin is produced .  There are two types of melanin , eumelanin which gives skin a brown colour (tan) and pheomelanin which gives skin a red colour (burn).  Regular sun exposure (e.g. every day) is associated with tanning. It increases eumelanin levels which gives skin a brownish tan and provides protection against the sun’s rays. This reduces the risk of burning and skin cancer with future sun exposure.  Irregular sun exposure (e.g. only during holidays or weekends) is associated with burning. It increases pheomelanin levels and increases cancer risk.  Exposure to artificial ultra-violet radiation from tanning beds has the same effect on skin colour and cancer risk as exposure to the sun’s ultra violet rays.  Skin Colour  Human skin comes in a wide variety of colours, ranging from shades of dark brown to almost white. Although an individual’s skin colour is influenced by numerous factors, the most significant is its content of a pigment called melanin. Melanin is also the pigment responsible for determining hair and eye colour.  Levels of melanin are primarily determined by genetics; individuals born to fair skinned parents will inherit their parent’s fair skin, as individuals born to dark skinned parents will inherit dark skin. The level of inherited skin pigmentation is referred to as constitutive pigmentation. A number of other factors determined at birth, for example the way a person’s body produces hormones and the way these hormones signal the cells which produce melanin, also influence skin colour. These factors inherited at birth, which cannot be changed, are referred to as intrinsic factors.  Extrinsic factors, things outside the body, also influence skin colour and provide acquired pigmentation. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the most important extrinsic factor. The sun emits UVA and UVB rays and the different types of UV rays have different effects on skin pigmentation. Exposure to UVA rays produces immediate pigmentation by influencing melanin which has already been produced and is waiting in the skin’s upper layers. Pigmentation which occurs several days after sun exposure is a result of new melanin being produced in response to UVB exposure. Other extrinsic factors which influence skin pigmentation and colour include DNA damage (often induced by UVB exposure) and age, as the way the body produces melanin changes as a person ages.  Skin type  Skin type is a classification based on the skin’s reaction to exposure to the sun’s UV radiation, after a period of non-exposure (e.g. sun exposure at the beginning of summer, when the skin has not been exposed during winter). The skin’s reaction is measured in terms of burning and tanning.  The Fitzpatrick system of classifying skin type is most commonly used in the assessment of skin cancer risk. The Fitzpatrick skin types are:  Type I     Melanin  Melanin is a pigment found in skin cells. There are two types of melanin which have visibly different effects on skin pigmentation. Eumelanin produces dark brown pigmentation and is the primary melanin type in individuals with darkly pigmented skin. Because eumelanin is insoluble, its skin-darkening (tanning) effects last a relatively long time, compared to the temporary skin-reddening effect of pheomelanin which is soluble. Pheomelanin is a red-yellow coloured pigment and the primary type of melanin in fair skinned individuals who are prone to sunburn. Eumelanin offers better protection from the sun’s UV rays compared to pheomelanin.  The melanin content of an individual’s skin is primarily determined by genetics meaning that babies inherit their skin colour from their parents. In particular a gene called plays a major role in determining an individual’s skin pigmentation. | Question: In the human body, which pigment is primarily responsible for the colour of skin?

Begun in the 1970s and ’80s and resuscitated at the turn of the 21st century, the Star Wars films continually advanced the field of motion picture special effects and developed into an enormously lucrative merchandising industry.  The sidekick “droids” R2-D2 and C-3PO from the original Star Wars trilogy …  Lucasfilm—20th Century Fox/The Kobal Collection  George Lucas’s success as a writer and director with American Graffiti (1973) gained him the backing of 20th Century Fox , which put up $9.5 million for the production of the first Star Wars film. The film, directed by Lucas, was in production for four years, with scenes shot in Tunisia and Death Valley , California, and on soundstages in England. When it was released on May 25, 1977, Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) met with runaway success. A space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the film centres on Luke Skywalker (played by the then relatively unknown Mark Hamill), a young man who finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an authoritarian empire and rebel forces. Skywalker and the opportunistic smuggler Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) are tasked with saving Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from captivity on a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth Vader , whose deep mechanically augmented voice (contributed by James Earl Jones ) became instantly iconic . At the core of the film and the series it initiated are the Jedi Knights—a group of either benevolent or malevolent warriors who harness and manipulate the Force, an all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of good and evil—and Skywalker’s quest to join their ranks.

The film won six Academy Awards along with a special-achievement award for accomplishments in sound, and it revolutionized the motion picture industry with its advancements in special effects . Lucas’s effects company, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), designed a slew of imaginative alien creatures and mechanical “droids” that populated a variety of exotic locales. Perhaps most impressive, however, were the elaborate space battles accomplished with scaled miniatures. The series continued to make remarkable advancements in the field of special effects into the 21st century, and ILM became one of the most successful effects studios utilized by Hollywood. Lucas followed the first Star Wars film with two sequels, Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi (1983). The franchise thrived in the 1980s and ’90s through the release of videos, a substantial merchandise line, and the theatrical re-release of the trilogy in 1997.

Get Known if you don't have an account  Share  WMG  Cinderella Man is an American film released in 2005, directed by Ron Howard , starring Russell Crowe , Renee Zellweger , Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko. It loosely follows the story of Real Life boxing champion James J. Braddock, aka "Cinderella Man" (played by Russell Crowe). It was an uplifting underdog story, set in a time when the country very much needed one.  The movie begins during what should have been the upswing of Braddock's career in the late 1920's. Braddock has it all — a successful boxing career, a pretty wife, Mae (played by Renee Zellweger), and 3 beautiful children. Cut to several years later, we find out that Braddock was forced to abandon his boxing career after suffering a broken hand. His wife saw this as a both a blessing and a curse, as she feared for his safety in the ring, but knew boxing was the best way for Jim to support their family.  As the Great Depression hits, Braddock is forced to do manual labor, working on the docks to (barely) support his family, who live in extremely poor conditions. At one point, he takes public assistance (a great source of shame to him) to pay his electricity bill, allowing his kids to stay in the house. After another boxer cancels at the last minute, Jim's old manager, Joe Gould (played by Paul Giamatti) asks him to fight the number two contender in the world. There is little chance Jim will win, but this is a Ron Howard film, so...  Jim wins the fight, thanks to new-found strength in his non-broken hand from his work on the docks, coupled with an uncompromising drive to support his family. After the stunning upset, Gould and Braddock discuss a full-time return to the ring. Mae is extremely angry with Joe for trying to profit from Jim's willingness to put himself in danger. She is surprised and humbled to see that Joe's belief in Jim is so strong, he and his wife have sold almost all of their possessions in order to pay for Jim's training.  As Jim continues to win fights, he moves closer to fighting the defending world champion, Max Baer (played by Craig Bierko), an arrogant and dangerous opponent in the ring. Jim's rags-to-riches story captivates the nation, earning him the nickname "Cinderella Man" and the fight is billed as a David vs. Goliath. Max Baer taunts Jim at every turn prior to the fight, attempting to humiliate him publicly. The boxing commissioner insists on showing footage of two of Baer's previous fights, where each boxer died from injuries sustained in the ring, so Jim is aware of what is at stake.  But Jim's resolve remains strong and he insists on fighting, because he feels a duty to all those who believe in him. On the night of the fight, Mae can not even bring herself to watch in person, or listen on the radio. In the end, of course, Braddock wins a stunning and hard-fought bout, enabling a Happily Ever After ending. But it is a Ron Howard movie, so this was to be expected.  Definitely not to be confused with Cinderella or the Eminem song of the same name.

It is believed to have originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France but is now grown wherever wine is produced. The Chardonnay grape itself is very neutral, with many of the flavors commonly associated with the grape being derived from such influences as terroir and oak. It is made into many different styles of wine, from the elegant, “flinty” wines of Chablis to rich, buttery Meursaults and New World wines with tropical fruit flavors. It is widely known for producing excellent full-bodied wines. The cooler zoned climate Chardonnay grapes produce an abundance of fruit flavors.  White Burgundy  You won't find the word "Chardonnay" anywhere on the bottle but the world's best Chardonnay wines bear only the name of the place in Burgundy, France where they were made. These are known as "white Burgundy" wines, and are usually 100% Chardonnay. The three primary Chardonnay winegrowing regions within Burgundy are 1) Côte de Beaune, 2) Chablis and 3) Mâconnais.  The Côte de Beaune region is home to the greatest of all white Burgundy wines, made in villages of Meursault, Puligny-Montrachet, Chassagne-Montrachet and the Corton-Charlemagne vineyard. Unlike other white Burgundies, these wines are fermented and aged in oak barrels, emerging lucious and full-bodied.  Chablis chardonnays are characterised by tingly lemon, green apple, and mineral flavors that can seem sour at first but are excellent when paired with the right dish. There are three levels of quality (and price) from basic Chablis, to Chablis Premier Cru to Chablis Grand Cru.  The Mâconnais region is a source of "value" Chardonnays, including Pouilly-Fuissé and Mâcon-Villages, in comparison to other white Burgundy wines. Reliable producers include Louis Latour, Bouchard, Jadot and others.  Domestic and New World Chardonnay  California and other domestic Chardonnays are very different in style, usually richer and heavier than French Chardonnays, and are often oaked for a vanilla-bean or smoky bouquet. Oak also lends a golden color to the wine. Big buttery (see malolatic fermentation ) or overoaked Chardonnays can overwhelm delicate dishes and sometimes are made to mask poor quality, flavorless grapes. The best examples of domestic Chardonnay are perfectly balanced with good acidity. Napa Valley Chateau Montelena produces an indisputably balanced Chardonnay, which won the attention of the world in the famous 1976 Paris Blind Wine Tasting that put California wine on the world map. (If you haven't seen it, check out the movie "Bottle Shock" and our short video about this historic event.)  Australia, New Zealand and Chile also produce good quality, inexpensive chardonnay with bright tropical fruits. Their style tends to resemble California Chardonnay.  Tasting          Chardonnay  You can pick up apple, pineapple, or the hint of peach. The warmer climate Chardonnays may have less of the fruits but develop wonderful honey, vanilla, and roasted flavors that really fill the mouth. While many examples of Chardonnay can benefit from a few years of bottle aging, especially if they have high acidity, most Chardonnays are meant to be consumed in their youth. Notable exceptions to this are the most premium examples of Chablis and white Burgundies.  Food & Chardonnay Wine Pairings  Due to the wide range of styles, Chardonnay has the potential to be paired with a diverse spectrum of food types. It is most commonly paired with roast chicken and other white meats such as turkey. Heavily oak influenced Chardonnays do not pair well with more delicate fish and seafood dish. Instead, those wines tend to go better with smoked fish, spicy southeast Asian cuisine, garlic and guacamole dips.  Looking for an interesting alternative to Chardonnay? You might try a Viognier.  It offers a full, rich body and intense aromas with high alcohol content. Viognier has tropical fruit and floral aromas instead of Chardonnay's vanilla and butter scents.

Just like fingernails, the horny shell has no nerves or blood vessels. The horny hoof wall grows out from the coronary band that sits just at the hair line above the hoof.  The hoof itself is thick and hard, yet pliable. The hoof wall is thickest at the toe and thinner at the heel. The ideal horse hoof anatomy should have a nice rounded toe and a wide heel base. A narrow heel suggests the presence of navicular disease or the tendency toward contracting navicular.  The hoof will soften in wet conditions and dry out in dry conditions. Adding a bit of vegetable oil to your horse’s diet will help keep the hooves strong and moisturized from the inside out. Just like human nails and hair, the horses hoof and coat will respond to oils in the diet.  Horse Hoof Anatomy – The Bottom Side  Looking at the illustration you can clearly see the structure of the bottom of the hoof. The most pronounced feature is the triangular shaped frog. The frog acts as a shock absorber. It is the softest part of the horses hoof and expands with each step, as does the flexible heel of the hoof. Horse shoes should be slightly wider than the heel of the hoof to allow for this expansion.  Did you know the frog sheds twice a year?  The white line is the transitional tissue between the tough horny outer wall of the hoof, and the sensitive inner tissues of the hoof. When a farrier is shoeing a horse, he places the nails into the horny wall that has no nerve or blood vessels. A white line that is pierced by a farriers nail causes pain, lameness and possible infection.  The bars of the hoof serve in several ways. They help to take up some of the weight that is placed on the hoof wall and they keep the hoof from over and under expanding. The bars also spread out slightly with each step to help drive the ‘heart pump’ action of the hoof.  Horse Hoof Anatomy – The Inner Structure  The coffin bone is the ‘toe’ bone of the horse’s foot. This bone is shaped like a small hoof with flared sides. This is the bone that rotates downward to pierce the sole of the foot in a horse with founder. The coffin bone meets the short pastern bone while the tiny navicular bone just behind them both inside the horses hoof.  The Horse Hoof - The Second Heart  Did you know that a horse has no muscles in their lower leg? The lower leg is made up of bone, ligament and tendons, and of course the all important hoof. The horse hoof anatomy allows the hoof to act as a second heart. With each step the horse takes, the flexible hoof expands and contracts, forcing blood back up the horses leg toward the heart.   This is why keeping a horse in a stall with little activity is so unhealthy. The lack of exercise and movement cuts down on circulation. This can cause a horse to “stock up”,  a condition where the lower legs are swollen from lack of circulation.  The sole of the hoof is harder than the frog and softer than the outer hoof wall. It is flexible and acts at the ‘heart pump’. The sole in the front hoof is round shaped, while the sole of the back hoof is more oval shaped. A concave sole is preferable to a flat sole.

A circular arrangement of standing stone pillars, many of which are topped with a horizontal stone slab, the architecture of Stonehenge is a marvel in itself, which has caused scholars to study how the structure was built.  The stones are arranged in the post-and-lintel formation. Five trilithons make up the inner horse-shoe shape. The outer ring of the Neolithic monument has 30 lintel stones joined with the tongue and groove joint woodworking technique. The biggest stones, also called sarsens, are believed to have been brought from Marlborough Down. The small stones, or the bluestones are believed to have been quarried from about 200 km away in Pembroke County, Wales.  A huge heel stone lies in front of the northeast entry. It is an enormous unshaped boulder. The Slaughter Stone is also located close to this entrance. It seems to be a fallen monolith that extends into the river.  The mysteries surrounding Stonehenge draw visitors from around the world. Some believe that it was used for burial of the dead while others believe that it was a place of healing. Some reckon that it is a kind of solar calendar while others opine that it is a place of worship.  The questions such as who were the people behind the construction of Stonehenge or why was the monument erected, are still a mystery. Yet, the Stonehenge was decoded to some extent, by Prof. Mike Parker Pearson, University of Sheffield. While excavating in a farmer’s field, located about less than 2 miles of the Stonehenge, the team of Prof. Pearson comprising of several archeologists, found out the remains of a big prehistoric village. In a National Geographic Channel documentary, he has tried to uncover some secrets of the monument, which are discussed as under:  The radiocarbon dating of the circle suggests the origins of the Stonehenge around 4500 years ago, long before King Arthur’s reign. It was exactly the period when the Great Pyramids were being constructed.  The Stonehenge temple is made up of 75 massive sarsen stones (local sandstones) set up between 3500 and 5000 years ago.  The monument is aligned along the axis of the sun, thus it catches the sun at its center during the summer solstice.  In 2004, long trenches were excavated to find avenues that connect the wooden circle and the river.  In 2005, carbon dating was performed on the wooden Stonehenge, which led to the conclusion that it was built during the same time (as the stone Stonehenge). The wooden replica of the monument had 160 massive poles. Its inner rings were similar in shape and size to the Stonehenge. The creation of such masterpieces require sophisticated engineering techniques.  It is the only rock structure with carved stones and joined with the tongue and groove joint at the ends.  Prof. Pearson also believes that the design of the Stonehenge hints that the monument occupied a central position in the ceremonial landscape. It was used to house the spirits of the dead. It may have associations with another mysterious monument. A grand avenue connected the Stonehenge to the River Avon.  Among other theories, Prof. Pearson proposes that several tribes gathered from Southern Britain during the summer solstice to thank their ancestors to bring back life to the land, animals, and themselves. During the winter solstice, they would probably again gather at the site to perform the ceremony for the dead.  Around 240 human remains were discovered at the site. The carbon dating technique unveiled that the remains belonged to the 5th century. As the number of remains was less, Prof. Pearson proposed that these may have been the remains of the ruling dynasty and the remains of all other people were deposited somewhere else. Probably, the river symbolized the beginning of another journey, the remains of the dead were put into it.  About two-and-a-half km away | Question: In which English county is Stonehenge?

08/15/2021 15:45:51 - INFO - __main__ - Context: Cape CodCape Cod is a geographic cape separated from the mainland by the Cape Cod Canal.  It extends into the Atlantic Ocean from the southeastern corner of mainland Massachusetts, in the northeastern United States.  Its historic, maritime character and ample beaches attract heavy tourism during the summer months.  Cape Cod stretches from Provincetown in the northeast to Woods Hole in the southwest. Cape Cod, as defined by the Cape Cod Commission's enabling legislation, comprises Barnstable County. The Cape Cod Canal cuts  roughly across the base of the peninsula, though the western boundary of the cape extends to include small portions of the towns of Bourne and Sandwich which lie on the mainland side of the canal.   Two highway bridges cross the Cape Cod Canal: the Sagamore Bridge and the Bourne Bridge. In addition, the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge carries railway freight and limited passenger services onto the Cape. Cape territory is divided into fifteen towns with many villages.  Region of Cape Cod and the Islands   Like Cape Cod itself, the islands south of the Cape have evolved from whaling and trading areas to become resort destinations, attracting wealthy families, celebrities, and other tourists.  These include the large nearby islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard which have grown in population by 6.8 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, between 2000 and 2010 while the year-round population of Barnstable County dropped 3 percent according to the Census.   Both islands are also famous summer tourist destinations, commonly accessed by ferry from several locations on the cape. The phrases Cape Cod and the Islands and the Cape and Islands are often used to describe the whole region of Barnstable County, Dukes County (including Martha's Vineyard and the smaller Elizabeth Islands), and Nantucket County.  Several small islands right off Cape Cod, including Monomoy Island, Monomoscoy Island, Popponesset Island, and Seconsett Island, are also in Barnstable County.  The Forbes family-owned Naushon Island was first purchased by John Murray Forbes. Naushon is one of the Elizabeth Islands, many of which are privately owned. One of the publicly accessible Elizabeths is the southernmost island in the chain, Cuttyhunk, with a year-round population of 52 people. Several prominent families have established compounds or estates on the larger islands, making these islands some of the wealthiest resorts in the Northeast, yet they retain much of the early merchant trading and whaling culture.  Cape Cod in particular is a popular retirement area; 27.8% of the population of Barnstable County is 65 years old or older.,  and the average age of residents is the highest of any area in New England. By voter registration numbers, Democrats outnumber Republicans by less in the three counties than in the whole of Massachusetts, to varying degrees.   The bulk of the land in the area is glacial terminal moraine and represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast New England; similar glacial formations make up Long Island in New York and Block Island in Rhode Island.  Geography and political divisions  Physical geography and boundaries  The name "Cape Cod", as it was first used in 1602, applied only to the very tip of the peninsula. It remained that way for 125 years, until the "Precinct of Cape Cod" was incorporated as the Town of Provincetown. No longer in "official" use over the ensuing decades, the name came to mean all of the land east of the Manomet and Scusset rivers – essentially along the line that became the Cape Cod Canal. The creation of the canal separated the majority of the peninsula from the mainland, effectively turning it into an island.  Indeed, most agencies, including the Cape Cod Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), treat the Cape as an island with regard to disaster preparedness, groundwater management, and the like.   Most "Cape Codders" – residents of "The Cape" – refer to all land on the mainland side of the canal as "off-Cape." However, the legal delineation of Cape Cod, coincident to the boundaries of Barnstable County, extends to the northwest boundaries of the towns of Bourne and Sandwich – | Question: Which island off Cape Cod was once the site of the world's biggest whaling port?

DJ Taylor on Alan Sillitoe's fiction | Books | The GuardianDJ Taylor on Alan Sillitoe's fiction | Books | The Guardian  Share on Messenger  Close  For an all-purpose introduction to Alan Sillitoe's half century or so as a professional writer, it would be difficult to touch "The Match", a short story written in the mid-1950s that first saw the light in his collection The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (1959). Set on a grim winter Saturday in Eden-era Nottingham, and taking as its catalyst a soccer match between Notts County and Bristol City, its seven or eight pages are a brisk exercise in determinism, built upon a failing and abusive marriage.  Nervy, middle-aged Lennox is watching the game with his much younger neighbour. To the newly married Fred, County's defeat is a matter for mild disappointment: he can take football or leave it. But to Lennox the result seems to symbolise all the miseries of his life. Speeding ill-temperedly home, he upends his tea on the carpet, picks a quarrel with his wife and viciously assaults her. Eventually Fred and Ruby, listening through the party wall, note that the noise in the next house has died down. After a slamming of doors and much walking to and fro outside, Mrs Lennox takes the children and leaves him "for the last time".  As Harry Ritchie points out in his Success Stories: Literature and the Media in England 1950-1959, contemporary critics responded to "The Match" and the other stories in the collection as they would have done to a piece of cinema verité: snapshots from a world they knew nothing of - in this case the bloodied hearths of the Nottingham council terraces - whose interest was as much anthropological as literary.  Fifty years later, in a world where the working-class novel is only one among many fictional varieties, what distinguishes the story is not so much its "realistic" treatment of working-class life as its artistry. Some of this is to do with the psychology - Lennox's wife, for example, reproaching her husband in a way that she knows will drive him to fury. Quite as much, though, hangs on the lurking sense of prefiguration. Not only does the reader anticipate Lennox's destiny from the moment he opens his mouth: he is also encouraged to connect it to an endless cycle of working-class lives ruined by bad temper and failure to communicate. The brief description of Fred's 19-year-old wife hammers this inference home. "Plump like a pear, not round like a pudding, already pregnant though they'd only been married a month", Ruby is clearly Mrs Lennox in embryo, needing only a couple of decades | Question: Arthur Seaton is the hero of which 1958 novel set in Nottingham?

It is the largest lake in Central America and one of the very few, or perhaps the only, freshwater lake to have sharks, although their numbers have dropped precipitously.  The adventurous are rewarded by the splendor of volcanoes, jungle villages, placid lakes, and pristine beaches, untouched islands, like you'll find boating in Lago de Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America and home to rare freshwater sharks. Or perhaps you'll discover a remote surf break on the southwestern Pacific coast.  Largest Lake In Central America Nicaragua is home to the largest lake in Central America locally known as Cocibolca or Lake Nicaragua. Nearly 20% of the total landmass of Nicaragua is set aside in 78 different National Parks and protected areas.  People considered digging a canal through either Nicaragua or Panama-if they had used Nicaragua, they would have dug a canal to Lake Nicaragua (the largest lake in Central America), then another one away from it. Instead, it was dug through the Isthmus of Panama.  The largest Central American nation, Nicaragua, is full of parks and reserves and more lakes than any other Central American nation. Located between Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south and with long coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, Nicaragua is about one-third tropical rainforests and is split in half by a mountain range scattered with volcanoes.  Also known as La Mar Dulce (the Sweet Sea), Lake Nicaragua is the largest lake in Central America and the tenth largest freshwater lake in the world. Forty-five rivers flow into the lake and it is home to the worlds only species of freshwater shark.  The lake is connected to the Caribbean Sea by the San Juan River, historically making the lakeside city of Granada, Nicaragua an Atlantic port although it is closer to the Pacific. The lake has a history of Caribbean pirates which assaulted nearby Granada on three occasions.[1]. Despite draining into the Caribbean Sea, the Pacific Ocean is near enough to be seen from the mountains of Ometepe.  Before construction of the Panama Canal, a stagecoach line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company connected the lake with the Pacific across the low hills of the narrow Isthmus of Rivas. Plans were made to take advantage of this route to build an interoceanic canal, the Nicaragua Canal, but the Panama Canal was built instead. In order to quell competition with the Panama Canal, the U.S. secured all rights to a canal along this route in the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty of 1916. However, the idea of another canal in Nicaragua still periodically resurfaces. Ecocanal is one of these projects.

As the heir to a major European banking business, he used his family’s vast wealth to fund painters, sculptors, and architects, helping Florence emerge as a cultural center and spurring the Renaissance at great personal cost. He led the city-state as a despot, using everything from friendship to threats to secure and maintain his power. He cared greatly about Florence’s success, even putting himself in harm’s way to settle conflicts with rivals.  "I do not regret [spending 663,000 florins for charity, buildings, and taxes] for though many would consider it better to have a part of that sum in their purse, I consider it to have been a great honor to our state, and I think the money was well-expended and I am well-pleased."  Quoted (1471) in Living on the Edge in Leonardo’s Florence, edited by Gene A. Brucker, 2005, Google Books  Biography  Lorenzo de’ Medici assumed power in the city-state of Florence in 1469. The Medicis were among the foremost bankers in Europe at the time, accumulating great wealth, and they had ruled the republic for years. Lorenzo continued the family tradition of leading as a despot, and he centralized power through strategic friendships, marriages, bribes, and threats.  Despite this strength, Lorenzo’s rule was not unchallenged. In 1478, the Pazzi conspiracy – named for the rival banking family that instigated an attempted coup – tried to assassinate Lorenzo, injuring him and killing his brother. The attempt occurred with the knowledge of the Pope, and when Lorenzo retaliated against the conspirators, the Catholic Church (backed by soldiers from Naples) entered a state of war with Florence.  Lorenzo inspired Florentines to defend their city-state. However, as war dragged on, Lorenzo boldly decided to force peace talks by sailing to Naples personally. There he remained in the king’s hands for three months, until the king – impressed by Lorenzo’s action – agreed to end the violence. Lorenzo used this event to consolidate more power, as he could now argue that he knew the best way to handle threats to Florence.  Meanwhile, Lorenzo became one of the foremost artistic patrons in Florence, and all of Italy. He sponsored Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Sandro Botticelli. This set an example that spurred patronage across Renaissance Italy. de’ Medici also supported humanists, creating a library with classical works from the East. He expanded the Medici library and encouraged the study of classic literature in Florence and across Europe. Although the money he spent meant he left the Medici bank weaker than when he inherited it, he was groundbreaking in his support for the arts.  What Made Lorenzo de' Medici A leader?  Florence was a leading artistic city during the Renaissance, and Lorenzo de’ Medici was one of its most enthusiastic patrons. He set an example for the city to by endorsing several of the period’s leading artists.  Through multiple arrangements and marriages, de’ Medici assured his family of power in the Catholic Church (there were four Medici popes) and across Europe.  Lorenzo’s actions following the Pazzi Conspiracy showed his willingness to take risks on behalf of his people, and once he returned, the Florentine people were willing to follow him even after he used the event to centralize his power.  The Medici banking clan continued its prominence through Lorenzo’s reign, meaning that he did not just lead the city politically, but also economically. He used this money to promote art and architecture, enhancing Florence’s reputation as a cultural center.  Discover More About Lorenzo de' Medici  Keywords  Print  Hibbert, Christopher.

Since 2010, the tallest structure in London has been The Shard, which was topped out at , making it the tallest habitable building in Europe at the time. The second tallest is One Canada Square in Canary Wharf, which rises 235 m and was completed in 1991.  The third tallest is the Heron Tower in the City of London financial district, which was topped out in 2010 and stands at a height of 230 m, including its spire.  The Greater London area is currently about level with the Paris Metropolitan Area as the metropolitan area in the European Union with the most skyscrapers. As of 2015, there are 16 skyscrapers in London that reach a roof height of at least 150 m, with 17 in Paris (compared to 15 in Frankfurt, eleven in Warsaw and five in Madrid).  The history of tall structures in London began with the completion of the 27 m White Tower, a part of the Tower of London, in 1098.   The first structure to surpass a height of 100 m was the Old St Paul's Cathedral. Completed in 1310, it stood at a height of 150 m.  St Paul's was the world's tallest structure until 1311, when its height was surpassed by Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln. It regained the title when the spire of Lincoln Cathedral fell in 1549.  Although the spire of the Old St Paul's was destroyed by lightning in 1561, it still stood as the tallest structure in London, while the world's tallest structure became Strasbourg Cathedral in Strasbourg, France. St Paul's was severely damaged by the Great Fire of London in 1666. The title of the tallest structure in London passed to Southwark Cathedral, which stands at a height of 50 m  and no structure in London again rose above 100 metres until 1710, when the current St Paul's Cathedral was completed.   At 111 m, the cathedral remained London's tallest building until it was overtaken in 1962 by the BT Tower, which was topped out in 1964 and officially opened in 1965.  Few skyscrapers were built in London before the end of the last century, owing to restrictions on building heights originally imposed by the London Building Act of 1894, which followed the construction of the 14-storey Queen Anne's Mansions. Though restrictions have long since been eased, strict regulations remain to preserve protected views, especially those of St Paul's, the Tower of London and Palace of Westminster, as well as to comply with the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority.  The lifting of height restrictions caused a boom in the construction of tall buildings during the 1960s. One of London's first notable tall buildings was the 117 m Centre Point, completed in 1966. The National Westminster Tower (now called Tower 42) followed in 1980, which at 183 m became London's first genuine "skyscraper" by international standards. It was followed in 1991 by One Canada Square, which formed the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf development. Following a 10-year gap, several new skyscrapers appeared on London's skyline: 8 Canada Square, 25 Canada Square (both also at Canary Wharf), the Heron Quays buildings, One Churchill Place, the Broadgate Tower and the gherkin-shaped 30 St Mary Axe. Some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the Emporis Skyscraper Award in 2003  and the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2004.   With the precedent set by the towers of Canary Wharf and with the encouragement of former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, a renewed trend for building tall has been established in recent years. As of April 2016, there were 71 structures under construction or proposed in London that will rise at least 100 metres in height, including the South Bank Tower, which is being increased in height by 11 storeys.  1 Undershaft, planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London's skyscraper cluster, is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London.

It is a price-weighted index comprised of Japan's top 225 blue-chip companies traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange . The Nikkei is equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the United States.  BREAKING DOWN 'Nikkei'  Originally called the Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average (from 1975 to 1985), it is now named for the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" or Japan Economic Newspaper, commonly known as Nikkei, which sponsors the calculation of the index. The index has been calculated since September 1950, retroactive to May 1949. Among the best-known companies included in the Nikkei index are Canon Inc., Sony Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation. It is the oldest stock index in Asia.  The Nikkei was established as part of the rebuilding and industrialization of Japan in the aftermath of the Second World War. Constituent stocks are ranked by share price, rather than by market capitalization as is common in most indexes. Valuations are denominated in Japanese yen. The composition of the Nikkei is reviewed every September, and any needed changes take place in October.  Background  The Tokyo Stock Exchange was established in 1878. In 1943, during the Second World War, the Japanese government combined the TSE with five others to form a single Japanese Stock Exchange. That exchange was closed down in August 1945, near the end of the war. The Tokyo Stock Exchange re-opened on May 16, 1949 under the aegis of the new Securities Exchange Act .  Japan experienced a major asset bubble in the late 1980's, as the government used fiscal and monetary stimuli to counteract a recession caused by the Japanese yen's 50% appreciation during the first part of the decade. Stock prices and land values tripled between 1985 and 1989; at the height of the bubble, the TSE accounted for 60% of global stock market capitalization. The bubble burst in 1990, and the value of the Nikkei Index fell by one-third that year. In October 2008, the Nikkei traded below 7,000; this was a decline of more than 80% from its December 1989 high. It subsequently rebounded strongly, rising 150% between June 2012 and June 2015 with the help of economic stimulus from the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan . This was still nearly 50% below the 1989 high.  Investing in the Nikkei Index  It is not possible to directly purchase an index, but there are several Exchange Traded Funds whose components correlate to the Nikkei. ETFs that track it and trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange include Blackrock Japan's iShares Nikkei 225 and Nomura Asset Management 's Nikkei 225 Exchange Traded Fund. The MAXIS Nikkei 225 Index ETF is a dollar-denominated fund that trades on the New York Stock Exchange .  Trading Center | Question: What is the Japanese share index called?

Nominal weight  6 weeks from despatch date  Packaging  Beechwood lath and waxed paper  Waxed Paper and Wooden Box  Please note this cheese has a natural rind and may therefore carry mould spots of varying interesting hues from time to time.  History: A monastic type of cheese which owes its origin to the Cistercian order of monks who once farmed the pastures of  Hunts Court Farm whence it was launched in 1994.  As with many monastic cheeses, this variety is matured in humid cave-like conditions. The rind is washed in perry because the 100 or so varieties of perry pear known nationally are peculiar to this part of Gloucestershire and its border areas.  One of these varieties is ‘Stinking Bishop’, a name which seems appropriate for this cheese.  The Stinking Bishop pear was in turn named after a local mid 19th Century farmer called Frederick Bishop.  He earned himself the nick-name 'Stinking Bishop' because of his riotous behaviour.  He once took a cow to market and determined to drink the proceeds before he went home - he did, and then when the kettle was too slow to boil he shot it!

Milk of rare Gloucester cattle is used to produce the cheese though sometimes their milk is mixed with the milk of Fresian cattle.  Made with vegetarian rennet, this cheese is also suitable for vegetarians. The rind is washed in perry, an alcoholic drink made with the local variety of Stinking Bishop pear, which gives the cheese its name. The alcoholic wash gives the cheese its distinctive pungent aroma and brown/pink rind colour. As a result of the natural rind, changeable hues of mold spots appear on the cheese from time to time.  This unique cheese dates its history to the Cistercian order of monks. To keep up with the tradition of monastic cheeses, Stinking Bishop is also matured in humid cave-like conditions.  The colour of the cheese paste varies from white-yellow to beige, with an orange to grey rind. It is available in 5lbs wheels, each measuring 8-inches in diameter and 2-inches deep. The affinage takes from six to eight weeks. Stinking Bishop is produced in very limited quantities but its stinky smell has made it very popular in the United Kingdom and abroad.

The monument is made from Carrara marble. The Marble Arch used to be located in front of Buckingham Palace, but it was moved in the year of 1851.  The History of the Marble Arch  The Marble Arch is quite old, as it was built back in the year of 1825. It was designed by John Nash. The arch was originally intended to be used as a ceremonial entrance to Buckingham Palace and it served this purpose until it was relocated.  The Design  The arch’s design is unique, and is actually based on the design of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, which is located in Paris, as well as the Arch of Constantine, which can be found over in Rome. The arch was originally designed to include sculptures that depicted the victories of British forces during the Napoleonic Wars. An architectural model of the monument was made back in 1826, and if you are interested in viewing it, then you can do so at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is also located in London.  A man by the name of John Flaxman was picked to create the sculpture, but he died before he could complete it in 1826. The job was then split up between three men, who were J.C.F. Rossi, Sir Richard Westmacott and Edward Hodges Baily.  Getting To The Arch  If you are interested in visiting the arch, then there are a few ways to reach it. The easiest way to get to the arch is to simply drive there, as there is plenty of parking around the arch. However, keep in mind that you may have to pay some money to park. Another easy way to reach the arch is by taking the tube. The tube station is right near the arch, and the station is named after the Marble Arch.  Visiting the Arch  The Marble Arch is one of the most well-known monuments in all of the UK. This structure is unique and the design of it is simply amazing. The arch is also located by many different shops, which are considered to be some of the best shops located in London. Many people will visit some of the nearby shops after they pay a visit to the Marble Arch.

Take photos of your family in front of one of the most iconic structures in the city.  Built for the royal family in the early 1800s, Marble Arch retains its regal allure despite having been moved to a different location in 1851. Numerous theories circulate as to why it was relocated: some say it was because the central arch was too narrow for the royal stage coach, others say it needed to be moved out of the way to make way for a palace extension.  Well-known architect John Nash, who also worked on the palace itself, took inspiration for the design from Rome’s Arch of Constantine. Like the famous ancient monument, Marble Arch contains one large portal with two smaller arches either side. Above the arches are carved reliefs representing England, Scotland and Ireland.

We watched the depth finder and Dana pointed the bow toward the eastern end of Oregon's Odell Lake. It was a rare day in the Cascades, warm for this early in the morning. Today we would be fishing deep, down to 140 feet, hoping to connect with a big mackinaw.  Many years ago, when first I fished for mackinaw, I looked out across that big, gray, wind-chopped lake and wondered where a person should start. I spent a couple of days trying and eventually caught a few fish, but I wasn't satisfied. Something about the mammoth trophies on the wall of the lodge told me that I had a lot more to learn.  Lake trout, also called mackinaw are, in fact, members of the char family. But whatever you call them, they are creatures of cool, deep-water lakes. And they are predators whose primary feed is smaller fish, up to one-third their own size. Since their preferred temperature range is from 48 to 52 degrees, lake trout are commonly found in depths of 50 to 150 feet. In the spring, however, and in late fall and winter, when temperatures near the surface cool, big lakers can be caught in shallow water.  In many lakes, kokanee are the preferred food, but other species such as chubs, whitefish, squawfish, rainbows, cutthroats, and bull trout might be on the menu.  Macks are slow-growing fish. In most waters it takes ten or eleven years to grow a five-pound fish. Lake trout can live as long as 40 years. The largest lake trout on record was caught with a net in Saskatchewan's Lake Athabasca. The fish weighed 102 pounds.  Lake trout may be found at different depths during the course of a day. Some fish will be chasing kokanee, slashing through a ball of bait at 80 feet, feeding until they are full, then dropping down to the 100 to 150 foot depth to rest and digest their food. They compensate for changes in water pressure by burping air through a duct connecting their swim bladder to their esophagus.  My friend Dana Knepper of Central Oregon Spinnerbaits in Crescent Lake has spent more time chasing mackinaw than anyone else I know and he loves to catch the big fish. Dana fishes from an 18-foot Starcraft, equipped with a 90 hp Mercury outboard, and two Cannon downriggers.  Using a downrigger on each side of the boat, we trolled flashers and large M-2 Flatfish baited with nightcrawlers. Dana began marking mackinaw on the depth finder right away. My daughter Jennifer kept watch, wondering which one of those little pixels representing predatory lake trout would follow the lure and smash it.   We were in the right place to catch a big one. Odell's lake trout fishery was established by stocking efforts in the early 1900s, and Oregon's current state record lake trout was caught in Odell in 1984. That fish tipped the scales at 40 pounds, eight ounces. Most of the fish you'll catch will run between five and 15 pounds, but the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has recorded lake trout in the 50-pound range. Anglers come from all over the Northwest for the chance at boating one and many do, but what most anglers don't know is that there are strategies that will help you land the biggest fish. Once you know the secrets to catching these monster mackinaw, you can boat more big ones, wherever you fish.  LAKE TROUT TACTICS  When fishing for lake trout, use medium to medium-heavy spinning or baitcasting gear with ten- to 25-pound test line. This is a great time to use braided line because it does not stretch and deepwater bites are felt - and responded to - faster.  The braided main line is clipped to the downrigger with a quick disconnect that allows the fisherman to "pop" the line free and fight the fish without being tied | Question: What type of creature is a Kokanee?

It tells the story of the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda, condemned as a witch by the tormented archdeacon Claude Frollo, who lusts after her. Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer of Notre-Dame Cathedral, having fallen in love with the kindhearted Esmeralda, tries to save her by hiding her in the cathedral’s tower. When a crowd of Parisian peasants, misunderstanding Quasimodo’s motives, attacks the church in an attempt to liberate her, the story ends in tragedy.  About The Hunchback of Notre Dame  Before the huge crowd that packed the cathedral square, La Esmeralda stood between two executioners. Suddenly Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame, rushed at the executioners and felled them with his enormous fists. He snatched the gypsy girl in one arm and ran with her into the church. A moment later he appeared at the top of the bell tower. Holding the girl above his head, he showed her triumphantly to all of Paris while his thunderous voice roared savagely to the sky: “Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Sanctuary!”  Set amid the riot, intrigue, and pageantry of medieval Paris, Victor Hugo’s masterful tale of heroism and adventure has been a perennial favorite since its first publication in 1831 and remains one of the most thrilling stories of all time.  About The Hunchback of Notre Dame  Hugo’s grand medieval melodrama tells the story of the beautiful Esmeralda, a gypsy girl loved by three men: Archdeacon Frollo, his adoptive son Quasimodo, bell-ringer of Notre-Dame cathedral, and Captain Phoebus. Falsely accused of trying to murder Phoebus, who attempts to rape her, Esmeralda is sentenced to death and rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo who defends her to the last.  The subject of many adaptations for stage and screen, this remains perhaps one of the most romantic yet gripping stories ever told.     The Hunchback of Notre-Dame is an epic of a whole people, with a cast of characters that ranges from the king of France to the beggars who inhabit the Parisian sewers, and at their center the massive figure–a character in itself–of the great Cathedral of Notre-Dame. Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer of the cathedral; his foster father, the tormented archdeacon Frollo; and the beautiful and doomed Gypsy Esmeralda are caught up in a tragedy that still speaks clearly to us of revolution and social strife, of destiny and free will, and of love and loss.  The only widely available hardcover edition of Victor Hugo’s masterful historical novel of medieval Paris–one of the most beloved of world classics.  About The Hunchback of Notre Dame  The story and characters in Victor Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre-Dame  have resonated with succeeding generations since its publication in 1831. It has tempted filmmakers, and most recently animators, who have exploited its dramatic content to good effect but have inevitably lost some of the grays that make the original text so compelling.     From Victor Hugo’s flamboyant imagination came Quasimodo, the grotesque bell ringer; La Esmeralda, the sensuous gypsy dancer; and the haunted archdeacon Claude Frollo. Hugo set his epic tale in the Paris of 1482 under Louis XI and meticulously re-created the  day-to-day life of its highest and lowest inhabitants. Written at a time of perennial political upheaval in France, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame  is the product of an emerging democratic sensibility and prefigures the teeming masterpiece Les Misérables, which Hugo would write thirty years later.     He made the cathedral the centerpiece of the novel and called it Notre-Dame de Paris. (It received its popular English title at the time of its second translation in 1833.) Hugo wrote that his inspiration came from a carving of the word "fatality" in Greek that he had found in the cathedral.

This newly modified version was probably a response to poor sales of the 'Standard' the previous year, which may in turn have been due to the rising popularity of the more streamlined Stratocaster.  Gibson who have always been quick on the mark when it comes to redesign saw an opportunity to reinvigorate the line and cash in on a modernist shift in ideas, and guitar styles.  Les Paul apparently didn't like the design which is not surprising, as the SG lacks the 'pizzazz' of earlier models such as the 'Gold', as the SG has quite a plain aesthetic red finish.  His distaste for the new version went so far as him asking for his name to be removed form the guitar, hence why it is called the 'SG'.  Most SGs have a solid mahogany body and neck, and the traditional combination of bridge and pickup set up.  In line with Gibson's policy of appealing to as many players as possible, they released three versions; the Junior, the Standard, and the Custom, appealing to varying levels of playing experience and wallet sizes.   The model was a success, and over the years Gibson has expanded this very popular range with modifications, reissues, and special editions.  When the sub-company Epiphone launched, it released a cheaper version of the SG, which was due to savings made by cutting down on costs for materials, incorporating less features, and hence, it is seen as an inferior model. Pick-guards on the standard were experimented with over the years, until in 1972 when Gibson went back to the original design which seems like a lot of time wasted, but then again that's Gibson, they are willing to take a chance by putting it out there, and finding out what people think - the customer is always right! They had tried the larger 'Batwing', but it didn't prove to be very popular.  Vibrato (tremolo arm) tailpieces were also introduced as options, although more recent reissues have gone back to the pre-dated versions.  One highly innovative modification was the introduction of a motorized tuning system in the 2008 released Robot SG.  This invention is obviously a boon for guitarists, especially ones in bands with other members who will even whine that the keyboard is out of tune, never mind the guitar (no joking, anyone who's been in a band will have experienced this type of idiocy/egomaniac behaviour).  But, as this technology comes with a pretty heavy price tag, it hasn't been adopted on standard guitars.  Eric Clapton's SG standard, the "Fool", named after the artist who 'decorated it', was sold for half a million dollars, previously it had also been owned by Todd Rundgren who had bought it for five hundred dollars.  The SG has always been a favourite of heavy Metal guitarists such as Angus Young of AC/DC, and Tony Lommi of Black Sabbath, although Frank Zappa was also an SG player.  While the internals of the earlier Les Paul and the SG are pretty much the same, it's the body that separates them and the differing levels of playability due the specific neck that both models offer.  The SG has been so popular that it is still in production today, and there are no signs of its popularity waning.

In the episode, he receives gifts from different countries, including golden cats from the Egyptians.  Sinon, a Greek warrior in charge of the Trojan Horse operation, wants to give the King a gift for his birthday instead of destroying Troy because Greeks are the best gift-givers. He gives the King several gifts that are all distributed in large, wooden animals, and the gifts could be found by pulling a lever on the animals. The first two wooden animals have candy and chocolate in them, but the King tells his servants to throw them away because he hates sweet foods. Finally, Sinon sends the King a wooden soldier full of wild Spanish horses, which destroy Troy and run over the King, thus winning the war for the Greeks.  Contents  Edit  The King of Troy is dressed in a purple cloak and he wears a crown over an apparently balding spot on his head. His hair is white, and he has a long white beard. When seen standing by his main servant, he is shown to be considerably shorter.  Personality  Edit  While receiving his gifts, the King is seen as rather bored, especially when he predictably recieves a golden cat from the Egyptians. He is a bit excited when he sees the Trojan Horse because it is his largest present, perhaps showing his more extravagant tastes. One interesting fact to note is that the King isn't suspicious of the Greeks giving him presents while they are at war, though this is probably because he knows the Greeks enjoy showing off. After receiving two disappointing gifts from the Greeks, the King is annoyed by the arrival of the third gift. He panics when he sees the horses destroying Troy.  In History  Edit  In history, the King of Troy during the Trojan War was Priam,  who was known as a courageous leader. This is obviously not the case in the episode, where the King panics and is run over by terrified citizens and horses.

The song was written and produced by Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel Eriksen, and Shaffer Smith under their stage names StarGate and Ne-Yo. "Take a Bow" was released as the first single from the re-release and the fifth single overall from the two releases. It is an R&B song that contains elements of dance-pop. Critical reception of "Take a Bow" was mixed, with some critics praising the song's lyrics and powerful balladry impact, while others criticized the lack of originality with regard to StarGate's production.  In the US, the song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became Rihanna's third song to do so. "Take a Bow" also peaked at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and US Pop Songs chart, and has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song reached number one in Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, and attained top five positions in Australia, New Zealand and Norway. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and presents Rihanna as the female protagonist who leaves her boyfriend because of his infidelity. "Take a Bow" has been performed on "AOL Music Sessions" and was included in the set lists of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour (2008–09), Last Girl on Earth (2010–11), Loud Tour (2011) and Diamonds World Tour (2013).  Background and composition  "Take a Bow" was written and produced by StarGate and Ne-Yo. The song premiered on February 14, 2008, on the KIIS-FM radio show On Air with Ryan Seacrest.  "Take a Bow" was released as the fifth overall single from Good Girl Gone Bad, but the first from the re-release of the album, entitled Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded.  "Take a Bow" was made available to purchase in media outlets, via Def Jam Recordings' website, on the same day as its radio premiere in the United States  later being made available to download via iTunes on May 6, 2008.  The song is written in the key of E major and is set in simple time with a metronome of 82 beats per minute.  Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of C♯5. Musically, the song draws influence from the musical genre of R&B and also incorporates elements of dance-pop, whilst lyrically, "Take a Bow" tells of how the female protagonist expresses disinterest in rekindling her relationship with an dishonorable and unfaithful ex-boyfriend.  Critical reception  "Take a Bow" received mixed reviews from music critics. Upon the song's release as an official single, Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented its choice for the promotion of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that the singer could have chosen "Breakin' Dishes" which served as a promotional single for Good Girl Gone Bad and charted at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart in February 2008 —but had opted for "Take a Bow" due to it being new and more likely to find a receptive audience.  Levine continued in his review to write that although the ballad succeeds in its mission of telling of a failed relationship, he noted that the song was not at the same level as the singer's previous single, "Don't Stop the Music" (2007). Levine cited that his reason for this was that "'Take a Bow' does what it sets out to do very well, but it's an underwhelming follow-up to the dancefloor rush of 'Don't Stop The Music". Levine also commented on the song with regard to the other new songs included on the re-release, "Disturbia" and "If I Never See Your Face Again" (a collaboration | Question: Which singer had a 2008 number one hit with the song 'Take A Bow'?

His anarchic, groundbreaking BBC1 programme, The Kenny Everett Television Show, was pulling in audiences of some 20 million, a third of the British population, and his catchphrases were parroted in pubs and playgrounds up and down the land.  So when he contemplated coming out to the general public that year and admitting that he was living in a ménage à trois with two men called Pepe and Nikolai, his overwhelming fear was that he would be totalling his own career. A Catholic who once contemplated becoming a priest, he was so petrified about coming out that nine years earlier he had even attempted suicide.  Oliver Lansley, who plays the iconoclastic DJ in a compelling new BBC4 biopic, Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story, says: "He was terrified of what the press would say if he came out. He thought everyone would turn on him. But when he came out with the now celebrated announcement that 'two husbands are so much better than one', nobody was fussed."  In Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story, Katherine Kelly portrays Lee Middleton, his long-suffering wife, who remained devoted to him long after the break-up of their 12-year marriage. She agrees that, "He was really frightened about coming out, which is why he didn't do it for so long.  "But when he finally plucked up the courage to do it, nobody cared. His ratings didn't go down. His talent was so sublime that it didn't matter what was going on in his private life. That shows how flipping gifted he was!"  Tim Whitnall's drama, partly based on the biography by The Independent's David Lister, In the Best Possible Taste: The Crazy Life of Kenny Everett, shows Everett as the radio and TV pioneer he was, constantly reinventing those media. "He was an astonishing sonic innovator," says Luke Franklin, associate producer on the drama.  "He was a virtuoso when it came to running a radio studio and putting jingles together. When he started on the pirate station Radio London, all the jingles were imported pre-made from the US. Kenny very quickly started to make his own – he was the first person to do that." Everett also had eclectic musical taste and was the first DJ to play both "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Bohemian Rhapsody" – which he once aired 36 times in one day.  That same questing spirit, however, frequently landed Everett in trouble. Pathologically averse to authority, he was fired from several jobs for failing to obey instructions. Most notoriously, he also caused an almighty row at the Tory Party Conference in 1983 when he ranted "Let's bomb Russia!"  During all this mayhem, the one constant in his life was his amazingly durable relationship with Lee. Kelly says that, "the problem in their relationship was that Kenny was gay. He loved her so much, but fantasised about Burt Reynolds."  Lansley is hopeful that Best Possible Taste will help bring the unique talents of the man who has influenced an entire generation of broadcasters to a whole new audience. "I hope it refreshes people's memories of what a dazzling performer he was. He should be mentioned in every conversation about comedy greats and in the same breath as Tony Hancock, Spike Milligan and Monty Python. He's right up there."

(Getty Images)  Here, writing for History Extra, Sinclair McKay, the author of  The Lost World Of Bletchley Park  (Aurum Press) and The Secret Listeners, tells you everything you need to know about the famous decryption centre.  Q: What role did Bletchley Park play during the Second World War?  A: Bletchley Park was the Buckinghamshire house and estate that played host to Britain’s code-breaking triumphs – from the success in breaking the ‘insoluble’ Nazi Enigma codes to its incredible work on Japanese cryptology.  Its role was so secret – everyone who worked there signed the Official Secrets Act for life – that we only really started to learn about its achievements decades afterwards. And there is still much to emerge.  Q: When and how was the code-breaking centre established?  A: Before it was evacuated to Bletchley, the Government Code and Cypher School – as it was then known – operated from a building near Westminster. There had been a special code-breaking department since the First World War – then, it was referred to as ‘Room 40’.  In the interwar years, they analysed Soviet traffic, among other things. When it seemed obvious that war was coming once more, many of the expert cryptanalysts of Room 40 set up the new establishment at Bletchley in 1938. They recruited crucial new blood, including brilliant young mathematician Alan Turing, as well as lecturers and undergraduates from universities all over the country.  Q: How many code-breakers worked there? What did an average day consist of?  A: Numbers rose as the war went on; from a relatively small team in 1938 to something like 10,000 people – code-breakers, Wrens, WAAFs, posh debutantes working on the cross-indexing system etc.  Obviously, they didn’t live at the house. All these people, mainly young, were billeted around the town and nearby villages. Bletchley locals were disconcerted by some of the eccentric code-breakers, and they formed a theory that the secret establishment was in fact a special lunatic asylum.  There was no average day. Code-breaking went on round the clock, in a three-shift system, and in different huts – very often the work was done in plain wooden huts. There could either be months of agonising paralysis (as there was in the battle to crack the nightmarishly complex Naval Enigma) or nights of giddying triumph, as when 20-year-old Mavis Batey broke the code that led to British victory in the Battle of Cape Matapan.  Bletchley Park pictured in 1926. (Evening Standard/Getty Images)  Q: Roughly how many ciphers and codes were decrypted in total?  A: It is simply impossible to know – largely because Bletchley was so mind-bogglingly successful. They read messages from the German army, navy, air force, secret service… even messages from the desk of Hitler himself. Countless thousands upon thousands of communications.  They cracked Italian and Japanese cyphers, and the operation was spread across the whole wide world. In posts from Cairo to Murmansk, dedicated secret listeners for the Y Service intercepted all the secret coded radio messages – and relayed them back to England, and ultimately back to this incredible code-breaking factory.  The other miracle was the secrecy; the fact that the Germans never really guessed adds to this astonishing success.  Q: Is it true that the 'Ultra' intelligence produced at Bletchley Park shortened the war by two to four years?  A: President Eisenhower credited the work of ‘BP’, as it was called, with having shortened the war by two years. Think for a moment of how many lives those two years might represent; the countless people saved simply by the ending of the conflict | Question: Which English county is Bletchley Park, the WW II code-breaking centre?

Serve chilled. Very popular drink in France.  Kir is a popular cocktail that is created when the blackcurrant-flavored crï¿½me liquor Crï¿½me de cassis is combined with a white wine of the drinkerï¿½s choice.  To make it the even more well-known Kir Royal, champagne is added instead of white wine.  The origins of the drink are quite interesting.  Kir is named after Felix Kir, also referred to as Canon Kir, who ruled as Dijonï¿½s mayor between 1945 and 1968.  Kir enjoyed drinking the mixture of white wine and blackcurrant liquor so much, that he often offered the sweet concoction to visiting delegations at receptions.  His love for the drink was so popular that it was soon being served at the receptions as their official aperitif.  In addition, Kir allowed Lejay Lagoute, a producer of blackcurrant liquor, the use of his name during promotions for their liquor, Crï¿½me de Cassis de Dijon.  Today, when in a bar, those who ask for a Kir will more than likely be given a drink made with blackcurrant liquor and white wine.  The drink is quite refreshing, but doesnï¿½t have the sparkling kick that many people enjoy.  To truly enjoy all that a Kir has to offer, make sure to ask for a Kir Royal.  The bartender will replace the white wine with champagne to give it the higher end taste that connoisseurs truly love.  Of course, when ordering a Kir Royal, expect it to cost a little more than an average Kir since the more expensive champagne is being used.  But for a couple extra bucks, itï¿½s worth it!  Credit  Kir and Kir Royale: Two Iconic French Wine Cocktails | The ...Kir and Kir Royale: Two Iconic French Wine Cocktails | The Kitchn  Kir and Kir Royale: Two Iconic French Wine Cocktails  Kir and Kir Royale: Two Iconic French Wine Cocktails  Email  Cocktail Week at The Kitchn immediately brings to mind two iconic and much loved French wine cocktails, namely Kir and its more salubrious cousin Kir Royale.  I was introduced to Kir many years ago while living in France. Every Sunday, before a fabulously long lunch, friends, family and neighbors would gather for the apéritif' hour to chat, laugh, comment on the state of the nation and nibble on a wide selection of savory, salty snacks. Typically, Kir was the drink of choice and on special occasions Kir Royale.  The History of Kir  Kir originated in Burgundy, France. It is named after the priest Canon Félix Kir, who was a hero in the French Resistance during the Second World War, and also the Mayor of the Burgundian town Dijon from 1945 to 1968. He was much revered, and history tells us that he was also a big fan of local products and hence created the drink by mixing the local white wine made from the Aligoté grape (bone dry, acidic, with fairly neutral aromas and flavors and unoaked) with the local blackcurrant liqueur 'Crème de Cassis'.  Crème de Cassis is a deeply colored, viscous, sweet liqueur, which is made by macerating crushed blackcurrants in eau-de-vie. Once the maceration is complete, the liqueur is drawn off the blackcurrant skins and seeds and then sugar is added. The resulting Crème de Cassis liqueur is 20% abv and has about 400g/l residual sugar.  Canon Felix's recipe was delicious and a huge success, because the sweetness and flavor of the liqueur provided the perfect foil and balance for the austerity and acidity of the Aligoté wine. So successful was the combination it flourished and became famous not just in Burgundy but all over France, where it was often adapted to include other regional wines and liqueurs, as well as internationally all over the world.  Kir Royale, differs from Kir in that it is made using Champagne, rather than the Aligoté white wine. Hence it is more expensive | Question: What is added to white wine to make a Kir?
