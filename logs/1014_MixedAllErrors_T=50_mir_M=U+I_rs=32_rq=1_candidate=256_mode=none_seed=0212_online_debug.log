In most of the places in the world the turbine is steam - driven . Water is heated , turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator . After it passes through the turbine , the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated ; this is known as a Rankine cycle . The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different heat sources ; fossil fuel dominates here , although nuclear heat energy and solar heat energy are also used . Some prefer to use the term energy center because such facilities convert forms of heat energy into electrical energy . Certain thermal power plants also are designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes , or district heating , or desalination of water , in addition to generating electrical power . | Question: what are the main components of steam power plant ?', ['Water', 'steam turbine', 'electrical generator'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-18600'), ("Context: Alexandre - Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois , a French geologist , was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements -- similar elements occurring at regular intervals when they are ordered by their atomic weights . In 1862 he devised an early form of periodic table , which he named Vis tellurique ( the ' telluric helix ' ) , after the element tellurium , which fell near the center of his diagram . With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight , de Chancourtois saw that elements with similar properties lined up vertically . His 1863 publication included a chart ( which contained ions and compounds , in addition to elements ) , but his original paper in the Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram . As a result , de Chancourtois ' ideas received little attention until after the work of Dmitri Mendeleev had been publicised . | Question: who organized the elements in a periodic table for the first time where was he from ?", ['French', 'Alexandre - Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-3310'), ('Context: Since 1850 , only seven tropical cyclones have brought gale - force winds to the Southwestern United States .

Marketers normally select a single base for the segmentation analysis , although , some bases can be combined into a single segmentation with care .

Modern SMS text messaging is usually messaging from one mobile phone to another . Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person - to - person SMS text messaging service in 1994 . When Radiolinja 's domestic competitor , Telecom Finland ( now part of TeliaSonera ) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality , Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis . GSM was allowed in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US `` Carriers '' to use US technology . Hence there is no `` development '' in the US in mobile messaging service . The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for private communication services ( PCS ) -- what the ITU frequency régime had blocked for DECT -- Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications -- 1000 - feet range picocell , but survived . American Personal Communications ( APC ) , the first GSM carrier in America , provided the first text - messaging service in the United States .

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but "the devil\'s people", and referred to them with violent, vile language. Citing Deuteronomy 13, wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God, Luther called for a "scharfe Barmherzigkeit" ("sharp mercy") against the Jews "to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames." Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire, destroying Jewish prayerbooks, forbidding rabbis from preaching, seizing Jews\' property and money, and smashing up their homes, so that these "envenomed worms" would be forced into labour or expelled "for all time". In Robert Michael\'s view, Luther\'s words "We are at fault in not slaying them" amounted to a sanction for murder.

Now, the 1984 romantic comedy is getting a remake – this time with a twist.  Producer Brain Grazer admitted during an interview with CNBC that a remake of “Splash”; was in the works. While Grazer kept mostly mum on the details, he revealed that this version of the story would be told from the mermaid’s perspective.  RELATED: John Stamos Singing “Under The Sea’ From “The Little Mermaid’ Is The Best Way To Start Your Weekend  The original film saw an unlucky-in-love Tom Hanks fall in love with a beautiful mermaid, played by Daryl Hannah, after she rescues him from drowning. Directed by Ron Howard, the film was a commercial and critical success, earning an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  Simply titled “Wet”;, there’s no word on if the film’s original stars will appear in the sequel, but Grazer did share at least one big name could be attached to the project.  “There’s a movie star involved, or going to be involved,”; Grazer said during the interview. “I haven’t announced it.”;  RELATED: Casting Call: Stars Nab A New Role Gallery  “Wet”;”s mermaid star would certainly be at home on land or sea. The movie would stand to capitalize on a trend which sees Hollywood showing some love to mermaids, as of late.  This past weekend, stars gathered together to give a live rendition of the animated Disney classic for “The Little Mermaid Live”; with Rebel Wilson as Ursula and Darren Criss as Eric. Up next, Chloe Grace Moretz will star in a non-musical non-Disney version of “The Little Mermaid”;, which is currently in the pre-production stage.  Movie Review - - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE ...Movie Review -    - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE - NYTimes.com  SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE  By JANET MASLIN  Published: March     9, 1984  THOUGH Ron Howard's comedies don't adhere to any familiar formulas - Mr. Howard's funny ''Night Shift'' was about a prostitution ring operating out of a morgue, and his even more disarming new ''Splash'' is about a mermaid in Manhattan - they have a comfortably old-fashioned flavor. ''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

The two contests were merged after the Review of Reviews agreed to being integrated into the government initiative . The £ 75 prize money of each competition were combined and augmented by a further £ 50 donated by Havelock Tobacco Company . Each competitor was required to submit two coloured sketches , a red ensign for the merchant service and public use , and a blue ensign for naval and official use . The designs were judged on seven criteria : loyalty to the Empire , Federation , history , heraldry , distinctiveness , utility and cost of manufacture . The majority of designs incorporated the Union Flag and the Southern Cross , but native animals were also popular , including one that depicted a variety of indigenous animals playing cricket . The entries were put on display at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne and the judges took six days to deliberate before reaching their conclusion . Five almost identical entries were chosen as the winning design , and their designers shared the £ 200 ( 2015 : $29,142.12 ) prize money .

Formula One cars of the 1990s made the most high - profile debut of this technology in motor sports , and enhanced variations on this theme are still in use in many forms of road racing and drag racing today .

Instead of a manual gear lever , the driver is provided with ( usually ) a pair of flipper paddles on the steering wheel , rally cars often utilize just a double - acting single paddle . Pulling on the right - hand paddle makes an up - shift and pulling on the left - hand paddle makes a down - shift . The paddle - shift system will use a sophisticated electronic control unit to provide the necessary logic to operate the shift mechanism .

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

It assumes an important position in salvation because the transgressions in question form part of a great system against which human power is helpless . Leon Morris says that `` Paul uses the concept of redemption primarily to speak of the saving significance of the death of Christ . '' In the New Testament , the redemption word group is used to refer both to deliverance from sin and freedom from captivity .

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 .

This line stretches from the hip joint ( or more precisely the head of the femur ) , through the knee joint ( the intercondylar eminence of the tibia ) , and down to the center of the ankle ( the ankle mortise , the fork - like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli ) . In the tibial shaft , the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide , but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6 ° , resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174 ° in a leg with normal axial alignment . A leg is considered straight when , with the feet brought together , both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching . Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis ( intermalleolar distance exceeds 3 cm ) , and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis ( intercondylar distance exceeds 5 cm ) . These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh 's adductors and abductors . The angle of inclination formed between the neck and shaft of the femur , ( collodiaphysial angle ) , varies with age -- about 150 ° in the newborn , it gradually decreases to 126 - 128 ° in adults , to reach 120 ° in old age . Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg : A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga ; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum . Additionally , a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle , the torsion angle , which makes it possible for flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head .

10/14/2021 02:23:11 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[("Context: The Black Pearl is a fictional ship in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series . ( The physical ship used as a prop during filmmaking is actually named the Sunset . ) In the screenplay , the Black Pearl is easily recognized by her distinctive black hull and sails . She was later raised from the sea floor by Davy Jones after making a pact with Jack Sparrow who rechristened her the Black Pearl . She is said to be `` nigh uncatchable '' . Indeed , in the first three films she either overtakes or flees all other ships , including the Interceptor ( regarded as the fastest ship in the Caribbean ) and the Flying Dutchman ( which is actually faster against the wind ) . Her speed is derived from the large amount of sails she carries . She is noted in At World 's End as being `` The only ship that can outrun the Flying Dutchman . '' | Question: name of ship in pirates of the caribbean ?", ['Black Pearl'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-17917'), ("Context: Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey , a naval flag designer , and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , designed the 1777 flag while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board 's Middle Department , sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777 . The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 . Furthermore , a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10 , 1779 , documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army 's use in battle . | Question: who made the american flag and what year was it ?", ['1777', 'Francis Hopkinson'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-4622'), ('Context: Diary of a Wimpy Kid first appeared on FunBrain in 2004 , where it was read 20 million times .

Storm Thorgerson had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour , and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics , eventually deciding that the songs were , in general , concerned with `` unfulfilled presence '' , rather than Barrett 's illness . This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band . Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music 's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve -- censoring the cover image -- and he copied the idea , concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black - coloured shrink - wrap ( therefore making the album art `` absent '' ) . The concept behind `` Welcome to the Machine '' and `` Have a Cigar '' suggested the use of a handshake ( an often empty gesture ) , and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album 's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake , to be placed on the opaque sleeve ( the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background ) . The album 's cover images were photographed by Aubrey ' Po ' Powell , Storm 's partner at the Pink Floyd design studio Hipgnosis and was inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings , for fear of `` getting burned '' , and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands , one man on fire . `` Getting burned '' was also a common phrase in the music industry , used often by artists denied royalty payments . Two stuntmen were used ( Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers ) , one dressed in a fire - retardant suit covered by a business suit . His head was protected by a hood , underneath a wig . The photograph was taken at the Warner Bros. studios in Los Angeles . Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction , and the flames were forced into Rondell 's face , burning his moustache .

However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators\' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, "My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action." | Question: What reasons cause failure of the disobedience with authorities?', ['lack of understanding', "a suspect's talking to criminal investigators", 'lack of understanding of the legal ramifications,', 'lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6924'), ('Context: The Constitution limits the offenses to the following : culpable violation of the Constitution , treason , bribery , graft and corruption , other high crimes , or betrayal of public trust . | Question: what are the grounds of impeachment in the philippines ?', ['culpable violation of the Constitution , treason , bribery , graft and corruption , other high crimes , or betrayal of public trust'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-71221'), ("Context: The Bering Sea is separated from the Gulf of Alaska by the Alaska Peninsula .

10/14/2021 02:24:24 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: Inverted JennyThe Inverted Jenny (also known as an Upside Down Jenny, Jenny Invert) is a United States postage stamp first issued on May 10, 1918 in which the image of the Curtiss JN-4 airplane in the center of the design appears upside-down; it is probably the most famous error in American philately. Only one pane of 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in all philately. A single Inverted Jenny was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in November 2007 for $977,500. In December 2007 a mint never hinged example was sold for $825,000. The broker of the sale said the buyer was a Wall Street executive who had lost the auction the previous month.  A block of four inverted Jennys was sold at a Robert A. Siegel auction in October 2005 for $2.7 million.  In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, prices fetched by Inverted Jennys have receded. Between January and September 2014, five examples offered at auction sold for sums ranging from $126,000 through $575,100.  Prices seem since to have recovered, for on May 31, 2016, a particularly well-centered Jenny invert, graded XF-superb 95 by Professional Stamp Experts, was sold for at a Siegel Auction for a hammer price of $1,175,000   The addition of a 15% buyer’s premium raised the total record high price paid for this copy to $1,351,250.  Background  During the 1910s, the United States Post Office had made a number of experimental trials of carrying mail by air. These were shown by the first stamp in the world to picture an airplane (captioned as "aeroplane carrying mail"), one of the U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 1912–13.  The Post Office finally decided to inaugurate regular service on May 15, 1918, flying between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The Post Office set a controversial rate of 24 cents for the service, much higher than the 3 cents for first-class mail of the time, and decided to issue a new stamp just for this rate, patriotically printed in red and blue, and depicting a Curtiss Jenny JN-4HM, the biplane especially modified for shuttling the mail. The stamp\'s designer, Clair Aubrey Houston, apparently troubled to procure a photograph of that modified model (produced by removing the second pilot seat from the JN-4HT to create space for mailbags, and by increasing the fuel capacity). As only six such aircraft existed, there was a 1-in-6 chance that the very plane engraved on the stamp by Marcus Baldwin—Jenny #38262—would be chosen to launch the inaugural three-city airmail run; the plane on the stamp was indeed the first to depart on May 15th, taking off from Washington at 11:47 A. M.   The job of designing and printing the new stamp was carried out in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the flat-bed printing press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.  Many collectors long thought the blue plane portion was printed first, thus it was actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first and it is the planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, it can be seen that the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames.

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.

It was during the Great Depression that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow went on their two-year crime spree (1932-1934). The general attitude in the United States\xa0was against government and Bonnie and Clyde used that to their advantage. With an image closer to Robin Hood rather than mass murderers, Bonnie and Clyde captured the imagination of the nation.  Dates: Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910 -- May 23, 1934); Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909 -- May 23, 1934)  Also Known As: Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, The Barrow Gang  Overview of Bonnie and Clyde  In some ways it was easy to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde. They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the "big, bad law" who were "out to get them." Clyde\'s impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie\'s poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!)  continue reading below our video  Profile of Bonnie and Clyde  Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law.  As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde\'s many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations.  While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush.  Background of Bonnie  Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker\'s job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas).  From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4\' 11" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.)  Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn\'t a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced.  While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929.  Background of Clyde  Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde\'s parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives.  When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.  At that time, West Dallas was a very rough neighborhood and Clyde fit right in.

For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect\'s talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators\' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, "My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government.

The infection can occur when a person puts anything into their mouth that has touched the feces of a person who is infected with E. histolytica , swallows something , such as water or food , that is contaminated with E. histolytica , or swallows E. histolytica cysts ( eggs ) picked up from contaminated surfaces or fingers . The cysts are readily killed by heat and by freezing temperatures , and survive for only a few months outside of the host . When cysts are swallowed they cause infections by excysting ( releasing the trophozoite stage ) in the digestive tract . The pathogenic nature of E. histolytica was first reported by Lösch in 1875 , but it was not given its Latin name until Fritz Schaudinn described it in 1903 . E. histolytica , as its name suggests ( histo -- lytic = tissue destroying ) , is pathogenic ; infection can be asymptomatic or can lead to amoebic dysentery or amoebic liver abscess . Symptoms can include fulminating dysentery , bloody diarrhea , weight loss , fatigue , abdominal pain , and amoeboma . The amoeba can actually ' bore ' into the intestinal wall , causing lesions and intestinal symptoms , and it may reach the blood stream . From there , it can reach different vital organs of the human body , usually the liver , but sometimes the lungs , brain , spleen , etc . A common outcome of this invasion of tissues is a liver abscess , which can be fatal if untreated .

Morgan Whitaker, AOL.com  Sep 28th 2015 7:00AM  NASA has set the Internet abuzz after announcing that it is unveiling a "major science finding from the agency\'s ongoing exploration of Mars."  The space agency is scheduled to discuss the details of the discovery on Monday at 11:30 a.m. EDT -- but speculation is already running rampant ahead of the big reveal.  READ MORE: Stargazers witness rare event in supermoon eclipse  Many space experts believe that the finding could be related to the discovery of flowing water on the planet\'s surface after noticing that some of the participants in the news conference are authors on a paper on the same topic scheduled to be delivered this week.

The attempt by Stanislaw August Poniatowski (1764-95) to create anew the Polish world was one of the most audacious enterprises of reform undertaken by any enlightened monarch in the eighteenth century. None started in less promising circumstances. Politically the King was trapped between a Russian protectorate and a nobility wedded to its anarchic liberty. The beginnings of the Polish Enlightenment had yet to make more than ripples on the stagnant waters of Polish culture. Yet by 1791, Poland-Lithuania had made a huge cultural advance, and had given herself a constitution admired across Europe.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.  Since the majority of consumers said that their favourite sweets were either strawberry or blackcurrant flavoured, Fox\'s has also created a new product | Question: What animal is traditionally seen in the branding of Fox\'s Glacier Mints?', ['polar bear'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2327'), ("Context: The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit ( 150,000,000 km ) , or AU .

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000. Westwood has performed particularly well in European Tour events, having won a total of 18 tournaments, and in 2000 he achieved the European Tour Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s seven year run of victory.

There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient\'s duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP\'s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don\'t deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, "I plead for the beauty that surrounds us"; this is known as a "creative plea," and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty. | Question: What third type of plea uses creative words?', ['no contest', 'creative plea'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6915'), ("Context: In transfusions of packed red blood cells , individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors .

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Presidents have entertained visiting heads of state, such a former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , conducted cabinet meetings, and briefed Congressional leaders at the retreat. The 1978 Middle East peace talks concluded with what have become known as the Camp David Accords. Yet few Americans know much about the place, considering its prominence.  Federal Summer Camp  It all started in 1935, when the Work Projects Administration , WPA, began building the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area Project near Thurmont, Maryland, as an example of creating parks from worn-out agricultural land.  Three years later, the area opened as a camp for federal government employees and their families. Known as Hi-Catoctin, the facility consisted of several small cabins, a dining hall, and a swimming pool. Covered with trees and 1,800 feet above sea level, the spot provided a cool respite from the near tropical humidity of the Washington, DC, area.  Meanwhile, immediately after America's entry into World War II, doctors for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt were urging the ailing president to find a place convenient to Washington, yet far enough away to escape the heat and political pressures of the city.  The presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was out of the question because of heightened security considerations imposed by the war. After a search committee considered two other sites on Furnace Mountain on the Virginia side of the Potomac River below Harper's Ferry; and Shenandoah National Park, Virginia; Roosevelt toured two sites in the Catoctin Mountains.  He picked Hi-Catoctin, issuing a set of instructions on how the buildings should be remodeled and asking for the construction of a main lodge, which resembled the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. The initial work cost $25,000. The camp was renamed the USS Shangri La, to follow up on the nautical connection, since many workers involved with the Potomac worked on the camp.  Popular Presidential Choice  Since Roosevelt inaugurated Shangri-La with a three-day visit beginning July 18, 1942, all subsequent presidents have made extensive use of the mountain top retreat.  President Harry Truman did not visit Shangri-La often because Bess, his wife, felt it was dull. However, when they did visit, the Trumans enjoyed Shangri-La. Truman's favorite sport was walking and he spent long hours wandering the mountain trails with a secret service agent in tow.  Renamed Camp David  President Dwight Eisenhower changed the name of the retreat to Camp David in honor of his grandson, David Eisenhower. Although he and his wife, Mamie, tended to use Camp David for private relaxation, Eisenhower held the first cabinet meeting ever to take place there. He also hosted British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David.  President John Kennedy and his family visited the camp often, enjoying the horseback riding and other recreational opportunities. Kennedy also allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use Camp David when he was not there.  President Lyndon Johnson held several important discussions with advisers on the Vietnam War, the crisis in the Dominican Republic, and other world events, at Camp David and hosted Prime Minister and Mrs. Harold Holt of Australia.  Reconstruction and Improvements  President Richard Nixon used Camp David as much as his five predecessors combined. Nixon had several new buildings built in compatible architectural styles, but complete with modern conveniences. He held cabinet meetings, staff conferences, hosted foreign dignitaries, and family get togethers at Camp David.  President Gerald Ford rode around Camp David on a snowmobile, and hosted President and Mrs. Suharto of Indonesia.  President Jimmy Carter hosted the now famous Camp David Summit in 1978, between Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and resulted in what are now known as the Camp David Accords establishing peace between Egypt and Israel.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.  Sanguinarine is used in some tooth-pastes and mouth rinses for its anti-plaque activity, but is no longer considered safe for prolonged use.

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy.

Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate.

Presidents have entertained visiting heads of state, such a former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , conducted cabinet meetings, and briefed Congressional leaders at the retreat. The 1978 Middle East peace talks concluded with what have become known as the Camp David Accords. Yet few Americans know much about the place, considering its prominence.  Federal Summer Camp  It all started in 1935, when the Work Projects Administration , WPA, began building the Catoctin Recreational Demonstration Area Project near Thurmont, Maryland, as an example of creating parks from worn-out agricultural land.  Three years later, the area opened as a camp for federal government employees and their families. Known as Hi-Catoctin, the facility consisted of several small cabins, a dining hall, and a swimming pool. Covered with trees and 1,800 feet above sea level, the spot provided a cool respite from the near tropical humidity of the Washington, DC, area.  Meanwhile, immediately after America's entry into World War II, doctors for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt were urging the ailing president to find a place convenient to Washington, yet far enough away to escape the heat and political pressures of the city.  The presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was out of the question because of heightened security considerations imposed by the war. After a search committee considered two other sites on Furnace Mountain on the Virginia side of the Potomac River below Harper's Ferry; and Shenandoah National Park, Virginia; Roosevelt toured two sites in the Catoctin Mountains.  He picked Hi-Catoctin, issuing a set of instructions on how the buildings should be remodeled and asking for the construction of a main lodge, which resembled the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. The initial work cost $25,000. The camp was renamed the USS Shangri La, to follow up on the nautical connection, since many workers involved with the Potomac worked on the camp.  Popular Presidential Choice  Since Roosevelt inaugurated Shangri-La with a three-day visit beginning July 18, 1942, all subsequent presidents have made extensive use of the mountain top retreat.  President Harry Truman did not visit Shangri-La often because Bess, his wife, felt it was dull. However, when they did visit, the Trumans enjoyed Shangri-La. Truman's favorite sport was walking and he spent long hours wandering the mountain trails with a secret service agent in tow.  Renamed Camp David  President Dwight Eisenhower changed the name of the retreat to Camp David in honor of his grandson, David Eisenhower. Although he and his wife, Mamie, tended to use Camp David for private relaxation, Eisenhower held the first cabinet meeting ever to take place there. He also hosted British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David.  President John Kennedy and his family visited the camp often, enjoying the horseback riding and other recreational opportunities. Kennedy also allowed White House staff and cabinet members to use Camp David when he was not there.  President Lyndon Johnson held several important discussions with advisers on the Vietnam War, the crisis in the Dominican Republic, and other world events, at Camp David and hosted Prime Minister and Mrs. Harold Holt of Australia.  Reconstruction and Improvements  President Richard Nixon used Camp David as much as his five predecessors combined. Nixon had several new buildings built in compatible architectural styles, but complete with modern conveniences. He held cabinet meetings, staff conferences, hosted foreign dignitaries, and family get togethers at Camp David.  President Gerald Ford rode around Camp David on a snowmobile, and hosted President and Mrs. Suharto of Indonesia.  President Jimmy Carter hosted the now famous Camp David Summit in 1978, between Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and resulted in what are now known as the Camp David Accords establishing peace between Egypt and Israel.

The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.  A Last Hurrah  In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.  \xa0  Final Stop  After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.  \xa0  The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.  \xa0  At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

Several people , mostly in the midwestern United States and near the East Coast , contributed to the game 's design and evolution , and this is when the game 's design took on the 4 × 10 space - to - a-side layout and familiar cards were produced . The original version of the game in this format was based on the streets of Atlantic City , New Jersey .

Byker Grove was the original idea of late TV executive Andrea Wonfor. In 1987, Andrea approached veteran soap writer Adele Rose. Together they created a single pilot episode featuring kids aged 8–11 at an out-of-school club (transmitted on Tyne Tees TV in 1988). In autumn 1988, Andrea got backing from Anna Home, then Head of drama, BBC TV. Anna gave the green light for a run of a series of six 25-minute episodes on BBC TV. The age of the main characters was raised to 12-16 after support from first producer-director, Matthew Robinson . The first series therefore centred on young teenagers crossing the bridge from childhood to adulthood. Although some of the action took place outside the youth club, the series was unusual among dramas in that the characters were rarely shown in school. One of the major settings was the foster home run by the kindly but strict Lou Gallagher, the longest-running character.  \xa0 Famous people  Byker Grove launched the careers of Anthony McPartlin ("P.J.") and Declan Donnelly ("Duncan") who are otherwise known as Ant & Dec as well as the actress Jill Halfpenny , Donna Air , former CBBC presenter Andrew Hayden-Smith and Emmerdale actors Dale Meeks , Charlie Hardwick and Victoria Hawkins . Also appearing in the series was the now glamour model Francoise Boufhal ("Ellie Baines"). Founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson who, after Byker Grove, became executive producer of EastEnders , Head of Drama BBC Wales and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia . It was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen Mamma Mia , the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham ( This Life , Doctor Who and co-creator of BBC One\'s Life on Mars ). The first writer was Adele Rose - in Series 1 she wrote eps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, her daughter, Carrie Rose, writing ep 5 - and the most prolific was Brian B. Thompson , who wrote 50 episodes over 12 series. Tom Hooper directed four episodes of the show in 1997. [1] Charlie Hunnam now stars in American TV series Sons of Anarchy .  \xa0 Production  \xa0 The Mitre , also known as Benwell Towers, acted as the production offices and the fictional youth club.  Byker Grove was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle . The actual youth club set was in Benwell , which is in the west area of the City, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne & Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the famous architecture that is the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) are used for filming backdrops.  The "youth club" building which is what the viewers see onscreen, known as The Mitre used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 90s) before it was bought by Zenith Television , who film the series. The building housed the actual set, production offices, make up suite and costume department. Currently the property is semi-vacant, and the Zenith North Television signs have been removed outside the building.  The final series started on 7 October 2006 on the CBBC Channel. Richard Deverell , head of CBBC, was interviewed on Newsround about the decision to axe Byker Grove. [2]  The eighteenth and last series of Byker Grove was produced by Tim Holloway, who also produced Casualty from 2000 until 2002.  On 11 March 2008, it was reported that Gallowgate Productions TV, the TV production company owned by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, purchased the rights to Byker Grove after the production company that made it ( Zenith Entertainment ) went into liquidation in 2007.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Scatter them across salads for a more filling effect, or drop them into soups a few minutes before the cooking time is up.  AMORI (also, SPIRALI/ CAVATAPPI)  A tubular corkscrew shaped pasta, A.K.A. pasta spirals. These come from Southern Italy originally and are an adaptable shape suited to many types of pasta sauce.  ANELLINI  Translates as ‘small rings’ in Italian (the ‘ini’ word ending refers to smaller pasta shapes, as explained on this pasta naming page ). Anellini are often used in soups.  BARBINA  A long type of strand pasta almost identical to capellini, usually sold in a coiled shape - to look like a nest.  BAVETTE  Effectively flattened spaghetti, and virtually identical to linguine.  BIGOLI  Bigoli is the Venetian name for a long pasta shape slightly thicker than spaghetti. Bigoli were traditionally made with buckwheat flour but these days makers often use wholewheat flour instead, giving bigoli a slightly darker finish than standard durum wheat spaghetti. (In Tuscany you will hear a pasta similar to this referred to as 'Pici' (pronounced pee-chee) or 'pinci'.)  BOW TIE PASTA  Called farfalle in Italian. A great small pasta for pasta salads like this scrummy vegetable dish . Learn how to make bow tie pasta shapes here .  BUCATINI  This pasta name comes from ‘buco’, which means hole in Italian, because bucatini is like a hollow version of spaghetti (almost like a thin drinking straw). Perciatelli is a wider version of bucatini.

CACCAVELLE (singular is CACCAVELLA)  This big boy pasta is currently the world's largest pasta shape. One 'caccavella' measures approximately 11cm across at its widest point.  Produced by Gragnano from Naples in the South of Italy, caccavelle are delicious when stuffed (i.e. with bolognese sauce or fried chopped eggplant), covered in a simple tomato or bechamel sauce, and cooked in a hot oven for 20 minutes. Buono!  CALAMARI (also, CALAMARETTI, CALAMARATA)  Originating from the city of Naples (‘Napoli’) in the South of Italy, calamari – also called calamaretti - are thick rings of pasta dyed with black squid ink so that they resemble sliced calamari (a squid dish). Note: if you like seafood, I recommend you try this easy seafood pasta recipe .  CAMPANELLE  A great pasta for catching dribbly pasta sauces , campanelle is a creative looking type of pasta that resembles a church bell (campanelle literally translates as ‘bellblowers’).  Campanelle's fluted edges also resemble the petals of a foxglove flower. (Thanks to lccavender for the great photo.)  CANDELE  This word means candles in English. Therefore candele are long hollow pasta tubes, roughly the same length as your average Church-style candle. (For a creamily delicious dish that works well with candele, try this Baked Rigatoni Recipe .)

[1] Gibson shot at Mussolini three times twice hitting him in the nose. Gibson was almost lynched on the spot by an angry mob, but police intervened and took her off for questioning. Mussolini was wounded only slightly and after his nose was bandaged he continued his parade on the Capitoline .  At the time of the assassination attempt Violet Gibson was 50 years old and did not explain her reason for trying to assassinate Mussolini. It has been theorised that Gibson, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat , was insane at the time of the attack and the idea of assassinating Mussolini was hers and that she worked alone.

Come Here To Me!  Ninety years ago this week, a Dubliner tried to kill Benito\xa0Mussolini.  April 5, 2016 by Donal  Benito Mussolini with a bandaged nose, after the 1926 shooting:  In April 1926, President W.T Cosgrave sent by telegram his best wishes to a recently wounded Benito Mussolini. Coming after an attempt on the life of the Fascist leader, Cosgrave wrote:  On behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, I have the honour to congratulate Your Excellency, and the Italian people, on the providential escape of Your Excellency from the odious attempt on your person. Sincerely hoping that the wound is not serious, I send you my most earnest wishes for your speedy recover. The infamous attempt has caused much indignation here.  For Cosgrave, it was particularly important that the Free State send its best wishes, as it was an Irish assailant who made the attempt on Mussolini’s life. Ninety years ago this Thursday, Dublin born woman Violet Gibson fired a revolver shot in Rome that could have changed the course of human history. The story is well known today, and has been the subject of a book and an excellent RTE Radio documentary . This post is \xa0primarily concerned only with how the event was reported at home.  The shooting of Mussolini in front of an adoring crowd was a dramatic event, and that drama was captured in contemporary press reports. The Irish Times reported that  The Italian Prime Minister, after opening the International Surgical Congress in the Capitol of Rome, was passing through a cheering crowd in the square to his motor care, when “an elderly woman in dark clothes” (afterwards identified as the Hon. Violet Gibson) dashed out and fired a small revolver almost point-blank in his face….  Signor Mussolini remained self-composed, reassured his entourage, and while pressing a handkerchief to the wound, gave orders that no reprisals were to be carried out against his assailant, who had been arrested. She was protected by police from the fury of the crowd, who tried to lynch her. She was carried to the police station by police and carabineers.  The shot Gibson fired grazed the nose of Mussolini, and while the press here condemned the “wicked and unprovoked attack”, in truth she did little damage to Mussolini beyond \xa0his requiring a bandaged nose for a number of days.

The  revolver was an ivory handled .44 caliber british bulldog. He Checked  into the Riggs House hotel room 222 on the night before he was to  execute his plan.  Guiteau  arrived at the rail station early on July 2, and lay in wait for the  President to arrive, lurking about the train station to find the proper  attack point.

President James Garfield planned to leave Washington D.C. around 9:30 in the morning on July 2,  1881 from the Baltimore & Potomac train station.

Garfield and Secretary Blaine  arrived at the train station and were making their way through the  crowds as Guiteau approached them from behind. Guiteau raised his  gun, aimed, fired and the first shot grazed and stunned the President. He then fired  a second shot that struck the President forcefully and lodged deep into his  back. Garfield slumped to the tile floor, looking on as Guiteau was pounced upon, quickly subdued and arrested. Guiteau requested to be taken to jail at once and he was obliged.  Guiteau  Left a letter to be found the morning of the shooting addressed to  General William Tecumseh Sherman: July 2, 1881. It Read...  "I  have just shot the President. I shot him several times, as I wished him  to go as easily as possible...I am going to the jail. Please order out  your troops and take possession of the jail at once."

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed] | Question: What is another term for rotors?", ['rotating discs'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-3467'), ('Context: Pioneer 4  Pioneer 4 was an American spin-stabilized unmanned spacecraft launched as part of the Pioneer program on a lunar flyby trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit making it the first probe of the United States to escape from the Earth\'s gravity.

It was the only sequel to win a Best Picture                   Oscar at the time of its win. [An earlier unsuccessful attempt                   at a sequel-Best Picture win was The Bells of St. Mary\'s                     (1945) - following the Best Picture winner of the previous                   year - Going My Way (1944). Later, its \'sequel\' The                     Godfather, Part III (1990) was also nominated for Best                   Picture - and lost, and two sequel-installments of The                     Lord of the Rings (2002, 2003) were also nominated,                   with the latter winning the top honor.

Five of its six un-rewarded nominations were                   for acting roles.

With his new honors in 1974, he                     would add three more awards: Best Picture (as producer),                     Best Director, and Best Screenplay Adaptation (again shared                     with Mario Puzo).

(Photo: Microsoft)  After more than 10 years, the era of the Xbox 360 is officially over.  Microsoft announced Wednesday it will stop production of the video game console. The company will continue to sell any remaining Xbox 360 consoles available at retailers until they are gone.  "The Xbox 360 helped redefine an entire generation of gaming at Microsoft," said Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft\'s Xbox division, in a statement. "I am incredibly proud of all of the work and dedication that went into development of the Xbox 360 hardware, services and games portfolio over the last decade."  Spencer says Microsoft will continue to support the device, allowing users to maintain access to the Xbox Live network and call for any technical issues. The company will also continue to sell games while supplies last.  The successor to the original Xbox helped cement Microsoft as a key player in the video game market. As of 2014, sales of the Xbox 360 topped 84 million worldwide.  Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .

Times  Kinect sex game will not become reality, Microsoft says  December 17, 2010\xa0|\xa0 5:54 pm  Microsoft’s Kinect motion controller has been out for less than two months and already there’s an adult company looking to produce a 3-D sex game for the Xbox 360 console.  But Microsoft, maker of Kinect and Xbox, immediately shot down any speculation that the game will pass the certification process.  Kinect enables video game players to move characters through the use of real-life movements made possible by 3-D object scanning and manipulation. Kinect uses cameras and microphones to track movement and voice commands as a controller.  So the Web was buzzing earlier this week when ThriXXX, an Austria-based game company, posted a YouTube video featuring a graphic demo of a 3-D adult game using the controller for Xbox 360.  But when Microsoft was asked about the prospects of the game actually making it to the video game console, a\xa0spokesperson said in a statement that it wasn\'t going to happen.\xa0  "This isn\'t the first example of a technology being used in ways not intended by its manufacturer, and it won\'t be the last," the statement said.  "Microsoft did not authorize or license its technology for this use," it said. "Xbox is a family friendly games and entertainment console and does not allow Adults Only (AO) content to be certified for use on its platform, and would not condone this type of game for Kinect."

Her stolen medal was returned  LONDON, England\xa0\xa0\xa0 ●\xa0 London police say a bronze Olympic medal stolen from field hockey player Hannah Macleod has been returned.  Macleod’s medal, together with one earned by rower Alex Partridge, had been snatched Wednesday from the Mahiki nightclub, where the athletes went following a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II in honor of Britain’s Olympic team.  Macleod and Partridge had publicly appealed for their return. Her medal was mailed anonymously to the England Hockey head office.  Police say the medal is being retained as part of its investigation but will be returned to the athlete shortly.  Police stressed Friday that the hunt is still on for Partridge’s medal and Macleod’s team jacket.  Police say a 31-year-old man had been arrested in the case and was later released on bail.  Rower Alex Partridge is still waiting for the return of his medal.  Earlier Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod had appealed for the return of their stolen Olympic bronze medals from London 2012.  Partridge said he was devastated when he realised his blazer, which had the medal in an inside pocket, had gone.  The 31-year-old told BBC Sport: “It’s very, very upsetting. It would mean everything to me to get them back.”  Partridge, whose bronze in the men’s eight followed a silver medal at the Beijing Games in 2008, added: “I worked for 12 years of my life to try to achieve something at the Olympic Games and that’s what I’ve got to show for it.  “While we were out and dancing away, I noticed I’d misplaced my blazer. In the morning, I thought one of the other Olympians must have picked it up by accident, but no-one had it.  “I always say to people ‘it’s not about the medal, it’s about the journey’, but I guess you don’t appreciate the value of it until it’s not there.  “It was only when I picked up my 16-month-old daughter from nursery that it really dawned on me. If it doesn’t come back she won’t see everything I worked for, which was a representation of being in the best British Olympic team and possibly the best Olympics ever.”  Macleod, who won her London 2012 bronze medal with the women’s hockey team, believes the theft was pre-meditated after viewing CCTV footage.  “It looked like a very well done job,” Macleod told BBC Radio 5 live.  “The CCTV footage shows a couple who were acting suspiciously and had done a couple of laps of the bar, scoping things out prior to approaching our group.”  \xa0  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news ...Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news | The Guardian  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post  Hannah Macleod's medal, taken from London nightclub while athletes partied, posted anonymously to England Hockey  London 2012 Olympic medalist Hannah MacLeod, whose bronze medal for hockey has been returned.

While Cinnamomum verum is sometimes considered to be "true cinnamon", most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from related species, which are also referred to as "cassia" to distinguish them from "true cinnamon".   Cinnamon is the name for perhaps a dozen species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus Cinnamomum in the family Lauraceae. Only a few of them are grown commercially for spice.  Name   The English word "cinnamon", attested in English since the 15th century, derives from the Greek κιννάμωμον kinnámōmon (later kínnamon), via Latin and medieval French intermediate forms. The Greek was borrowed from a Phoenician word, which was akin to the related Hebrew qinnamon.   The name "cassia", first recorded in English around AD 1000, was borrowed via Latin and ultimately derives from Hebrew q\'tsīʿāh, a form of the verb qātsaʿ, "to strip off bark".   Early Modern English also used the names canel and canella, akin to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word cannella, a diminutive of canna, "tube", from the way the bark curls up as it dries.   History   In classical times, four types of cinnamon were distinguished (and often confused):  * True cinnamon , the bark of C. verum (also called C. zeylanicum) from Sri Lanka  * Malabathrum or malobathrum (from Sanskrit तमालपत्रम्,  tamālapattram, literally "dark-tree leaves"), several species including C. tamala from the north of India  * Serichatum, C. cassia from Seres, that is, China  * Cassia (Hebrew קציעה qəṣi`â), the bark of Cinnamomum iners from Arabia and Ethiopia, literally "the peel of the plant" which is scraped off the tree   Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who report it had come from China confuse it with cassia.  Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a god; a fine inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of Apollo at Miletus.  Though its source was kept mysterious in the Mediterranean world for centuries by the middlemen who handled the spice trade, to protect their monopoly as suppliers, cinnamon is native to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Malabar Coast of India, and Burma.  The first Greek reference to kasia is found in a poem by Sappho in the seventh century BC. According to Herodotus, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh, and ladanum, and were guarded by winged serpents. The phoenix was reputed to build its nest from cinnamon and cassia. Herodotus mentions other writers who believed the source of cassia was the home of Dionysos, located somewhere east or south of Greece.  The Greeks used kásia or malabathron to flavour wine, together with absinth wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). While Theophrastus gives a good account of the plants, he describes a curious method for harvesting: worms eat away the wood and leave the bark behind.  Egyptian recipes for kyphi, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia from Hellenistic times onward. The gifts of Hellenistic rulers to temples sometimes included cassia and cinnamon, as well as incense, myrrh, and Indian incense (kostos), so one might conclude that the Greeks used it for similar purposes.  The Hebrew Bible makes specific mention of the spice many times: first when Moses is commanded to use both sweet cinnamon (Hebrew: קִנָּמוֹן, qinnāmôn) and cassia in the holy anointing oil;  in Proverbs where the lover\'s bed is perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon;  and in Song of Solomon, a song describing the beauty of his beloved, cinnamon scents her garments like | Question: Nine tenths of the world\'s Cinnamon is produced on which island nation?

This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic . Towards the end of this era , in 44 BC , Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated . The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar 's adopted son Octavian . Antony and Octavian 's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian 's forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ( `` first citizen '' ) with proconsular imperium , thus beginning the Principate ( the first epoch of Roman imperial history , usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284 ) , and gave him the name `` Augustus '' ( `` the venerated '' ) . Though the old constitutional machinery remained in place , Augustus came to predominate it . Although the republic stood in name , contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome . Since his rule ended a century of civil wars and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity , he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure . During the years of his rule , a new constitutional order emerged ( in part organically and in part by design ) , so that , upon his death , this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new emperor . The 200 years that began with Augustus 's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ( `` Roman Peace '' ) . During this period , the cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced .

Frederic, a pirate’s apprentice, falls head-over-heels in love with Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley. Frederic is due to be released from his apprenticeship on his 21st birthday, but there’s a snag. Born on 29\xa0February, Frederic discovers that he is technically still a youngster. Although very much in love, his dedication to duty is unshakeable. Can he find a way to live happily-ever-after with Mabel?  Synopsis  Act I  A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall  The pirates offer a toast to Frederic who is celebrating his 21st birthday and the end of his apprenticeship. Ruth, a maid who also works with the pirates, explains that when Frederic was younger she was instructed by his father to have the small boy apprenticed to a pilot, but she misheard and instead took Frederic to a pirate.  Now that his obligation to the pirates has ended, duty compels Frederic to devote himself to destroying them. When the men admit their inability to make piracy pay, Frederic explains that they are themselves slaves to their tender hearts, particularly regarding their refusal to take advantage of anyone they believe to be an orphan. Frederic wishes he could bring the pirates back to a respectable life, but the Pirate King rejects that possibility.  Ruth longs for Frederic to take her with him when he leaves. He admits that he is reluctant to marry her, though he is satisfied that, despite her age, she is beautiful. But when he sees a group of lovely young women approaching, he rages at her for deceiving him.  The young women are astonished to encounter Frederic and horrified to hear that he is a pirate. He assures them that he only wants to love one of them. They all reject him except Mabel.  The pirates surprise the girls and anticipate soon becoming their husbands. Their father, the Major General, enters and objects to the girls being married against their wills to pirates. He lies his way out of the situation by claiming to be an orphan. The girls are released from the pirates’ clutches, as Mabel and Frederic – ignoring the pleas of Ruth – look forward to their marriage.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

The consortium was granted license to explore oil all over the territory of Nigeria but the acreage allotted to the company in the original license was reduced in 1951 and then between 1955 and 1957 .

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.

LAKE DISTRICT, in England, a district containing all the principal English lakes, and variously termed the Lake Country, Lakeland and " the Lakes." It falls within the north-western counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire (Furness district), about one-half being within the first of these. Although celebrated far outside the confines of Great Britain as a district of remarkable and strongly individual physical beauty, its area is only some 700 sq. m., a circle with radius of 15 M. from the central point covering practically the whole. Within this circle, besides the largest lake, Windermere, is the highest point in England, Scafell Pike; yet Windermere is but roe m. in length, and covers an area of 5.69 sq. m., while Scafell Pike is only 3210 ft. in height. But the lakes show a wonderful variety of character, from open expanse and steep rock-bound shores to picturesque island-groups and soft wooded banks; while the mountains have always a remarkable dignity, less from the profile of their summits than from the bold sweeping lines of their flanks, unbroken by vegetation, and often culminating in sheer cliffs or crags. At their feet, the flat green valley floors of the higher elevations give place in the lower parts to lovely woods. The streams are swift and clear, and numerous small waterfalls are characteristic of the district. To the north, west and south, a flat coastal belt, bordering the Irish Sea, with its inlets Morecambe Bay and Solway Firth, and broadest in the north, marks off the Lake District, while to the east the valleys of the Eden and the Lune divide it from the Pennine mountain system. Geologically, too, it is individual. Its centre is of volcanic rocks, complex in character, while the Coal-measures and New Red Sandstone appear round the edges. The district as a whole is grooved by a main depression, running from north to south along the valleys of St John, Thirlmere, Grasmere\' and Windermere, . surmounting a pass (Dunmail Raise) of only 783 ft.; while a secondary depression, in the same direction, runs along Derwentwater, Borrowdale, Wasdale and Wastwater, but here Sty Head Pass, between Borrowdale and Wasdale, rises to 1600 ft. The centre of the 15-m. radius lies on the lesser heights between Langstrath and Dunmail Raise, which may, however, be the crown of an ancient dome of rocks, " the dissected skeleton of which, worn by the warfare of air and rain and ice, now alone remains " (Dr H. R.. Mill, " Bathymetrical Survey of the English Lakes," Geographical Journal, vi. 48).

Derwent (q.v.), rising in the tarns and " gills " or ghylls " (small streams running in deeply-grooved clefts) north of Sty Head Pass and the Scafell mass flows north through the wooded Borrowdale and forms Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite. These two lakes are in a class apart from all the rest, being broader for their length, and quite shallow (about 18 ft. average and 70 ft. maximum), as distinct from the long, narrow and deep troughs occupied by the other chief lakes, which average from 40 to 135 ft. deep. Derwentwater (q.v.), studded with many islands, is perhaps the most beautiful of all. Borrowdale is joined on the east by the bare wild dale of Langstrath, and the Greta joins the Derwent immediately below Derwentwater; the town of Keswick lying near the junction.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

Credit: Bartolomeu Velho, Public Domain  When most people believed the world was flat, the notable Greek mathematician, astronomer and geographer Eratosthenes (276 BCE- 195 BCE) used the sun to measure the size of the round Earth. His measurement of 24,660 miles (39,690 kilometers) was only 211 miles (340 km) off the true measurement.  The ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (AD 90- 168) set up a model of the solar system in which the sun, stars, and other planets revolved around Earth. Known as the Ptolemaic system, it remained in place for hundreds of years, though it turned out to be flat wrong.  Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986), known as Azophi to Westerners, made the first known observation of a group of stars outside of the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy.  Nicolaus Copernicus  Credit: Public Domain  In 16th century Poland, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a model of the solar system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. The model wasn't completely correct, as astronomers of the time struggled with the backwards path Mars sometimes took, but it eventually changed the way many scientists viewed the solar system.  Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles but in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today.

The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) turned the new observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons), as well as the rings of Saturn. Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. Galileo is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.  Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomena that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the first observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its moon, Titan.  Building on the work of those who had gone before him, English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws.

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ("Context: The Emancipation Statue is a public sculpture symbolising the `` breaking of the chains '' of slavery at Emancipation .

A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense. In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and United States v. Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification. | Question: What would someone who is civilly disobedient do in court?', ['inform the jury and the public', 'inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances', 'plead not guilty'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6835'), ('Context: United States Air Force Basic Military Training ( also known as BMT or boot camp ) is an eight - week program of physical and mental training required in order for an individual to become an enlisted Airman in the United States Air Force .

The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

It was celebrated in ancient Rome as the festival of Flora, the goddess of flowers, plants and fertility.  The festival had a licentious character which continued into the various pagan festivals that occurred across Europe.  Particularly, in Germany, these celebrations were Christianised to honour St. Walpurgia who brought Christianity to Germany.1 Some of the older traditional May Day celebrations included the crowning of a May Queen, dancing around a May pole and the gathering of spring flowers for decoration.  In France the symbol of May 1st is lily-of-the-valley (muguet).  This usage dates back to 1561, when King Charles IX, then aged 10, gave a sprig of this flower as a good luck charm to the ladies of his court.  The custom was revived around 1900 and today giving lily-of-the-valley to friends and family is a tradition.  The government allows these flowers to be sold tax-free, so it is a popular way for charities and other groups to raise money. The flowers must be gathered in the wild, not bought and then re-sold for this tax benefit to be allowed. The wild rose is a secondary symbol of May Day and may also be collected.  May 1st as Labour Day  May Day has another side to it.  It is also known as La fï¿½te du travail - Labour Day - and is a public holiday when all stores and even public transit may be closed. In France all workers except the most essential have an absolute right by law to not work on this day.3  This connection with the labour movement began in 1889 at a meeting of the Second International in Paris.  The Second International was an organization of socialist and labour parties.  Four workers had been shot and killed by police on May 4th, 1886 in Chicago while demonstrating for the eight-hour week.3 Known as the Haymarket Affair, it became a cause cï¿½lï¿½bre among labour movements, and along with other disturbances during a period of great social unrest, led to the declaring of May 1st as International Labour Day.  In 1936, wide-spread demonstrations on May 1st led to the formation of the first centre-left government in France which quickly introduced the 40-hour work week, two weeks paid holiday and the right to form a union.  Since then the day has been a consistent focus of labour activity and demonstrations. In France labour unions organize marches, demonstration and parades across the country on this day to re-enforce their commitment to improved rights for workers.  The Catholic Church has declared May 1st as Saint Joseph the Worker Day (Saint Joseph's feast day is on March 19th).5 In the May Day aspect, St. Joseph, the wife of Mary, is the patron Saint of Workers.  Mary herself is also strongly associated with May Day in the celebration of its Spring Festival aspect. The Pope always makes a speech on May Day in support of the rights of workers and the fair value of labour.  When is May Day?  May Day in France always falls on May 1st.  If it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is also observed on that Saturday or Sunday, and there wouldn't be a Bank Holiday that year.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

Blood types   are the basis of all Blood classification systems. This proved disastrous. In     the early 1800s an English obstetrician, James Blundell, came up with the idea of human     Blood used exclusively for human transfusion. Not until the 1900s were the,   no commonly accepted, basic four Blood types identified by     Karl Landsteiner. Subsequently, the success of Blood transfusion significantly increased     when patients were transfused with their same type. Now, research has shown that     transfusion with the exact type is even better.

The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee . Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag , but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy . Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime , when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work . These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting 's biography of Hopkinson . Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress , via the Continental Board of Admiralty , on May 25 , 1780 . In this letter , he asked for a `` Quarter Cask of the Public Wine '' as payment for designing the U.S. flag , the seal for the Admiralty Board , the seal for the Treasury Board , Continental currency , the Great Seal of the United States , and other devices . However , in three subsequent bills to Congress , Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash , but he did not list his U.S. flag design . Instead , he asked to be paid for designing the `` great Naval Flag of the United States '' in the first bill ; the `` Naval Flag of the United States '' in the second bill ; and `` the Naval Flag of the States '' in the third , along with the other items . The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed , that is , a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones . The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea . By contrast , Hopkinson 's flag for the United States had seven white stripes , and six red ones -- in reality , six red stripes laid on a white background . Hopkinson 's sketches have not been found , but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty ( naval ) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time . His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes ; whereas , his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones . Hopkinson 's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag . Remnants of Hopkinson 's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President 's seal . When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board , his position was like that of today 's Secretary of the Navy . The payment was not made , however , because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress . This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag , which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776 .

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds. The name “unmodified round brilliant” was applied to a symmetrical round cut with a regular array of 58 facets, cut to modern standards. The system was the culmination of years of research that included the results of preference testing among a wide variety of groups, including trade professionals and consumers.  GIA designed the system to assess the design quality and craftsmanship of diamonds cut in the standard round brilliant style when compared to modern preferences. | Question: A modern round brilliant cut has 58 what?", ['facets'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3808'), ("Context: On October 29 , 2013 , a Robocoin machine opened in the Waves coffee shop in downtown Vancouver , Canada .

The Pirates of Penzance – English National OperaThe Pirates of Penzance | Discover Opera | English National Opera  The Pirates of Penzance  Composer  Gilbert & Sullivan  Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera is packed full of sentimental\xa0pirates, blundering policeman, absurd adventures and improbable paradoxes.  Frederic, a pirate’s apprentice, falls head-over-heels in love with Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley. Frederic is due to be released from his apprenticeship on his 21st birthday, but there’s a snag. Born on 29\xa0February, Frederic discovers that he is technically still a youngster. Although very much in love, his dedication to duty is unshakeable. Can he find a way to live happily-ever-after with Mabel?  Synopsis  Act I  A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall  The pirates offer a toast to Frederic who is celebrating his 21st birthday and the end of his apprenticeship. Ruth, a maid who also works with the pirates, explains that when Frederic was younger she was instructed by his father to have the small boy apprenticed to a pilot, but she misheard and instead took Frederic to a pirate.  Now that his obligation to the pirates has ended, duty compels Frederic to devote himself to destroying them. When the men admit their inability to make piracy pay, Frederic explains that they are themselves slaves to their tender hearts, particularly regarding their refusal to take advantage of anyone they believe to be an orphan. Frederic wishes he could bring the pirates back to a respectable life, but the Pirate King rejects that possibility.  Ruth longs for Frederic to take her with him when he leaves. He admits that he is reluctant to marry her, though he is satisfied that, despite her age, she is beautiful. But when he sees a group of lovely young women approaching, he rages at her for deceiving him.  The young women are astonished to encounter Frederic and horrified to hear that he is a pirate. He assures them that he only wants to love one of them. They all reject him except Mabel.  The pirates surprise the girls and anticipate soon becoming their husbands. Their father, the Major General, enters and objects to the girls being married against their wills to pirates. He lies his way out of the situation by claiming to be an orphan. The girls are released from the pirates’ clutches, as Mabel and Frederic – ignoring the pleas of Ruth – look forward to their marriage.

It was cute and sweet and bouncy. It was tuneful and ingenuous." It was also, according to Cliff Richard, who took it to number one in the U.K. in 1959, "chronic. "Living Doll" changed the whole course of my career. I parted company with the greasy-haired rock & rollers and began attracting the mums. And that\'s how it stayed."  Originally written for singer Duffy Power, before it was transplanted into Richard\'s movie debut, Serious Charge, the song was, ironically, initially envisioned as an up-tempo light rocker and appears as such in the movie. It was only when producer Norrie Paramor suggested it become Richard\'s next single that the singer insisted on rearranging it into the now familiar form. He later revealed that he hated the fast version even more than he loathed the slow one.  Either way, it was a wise decision. "Living Doll" topped the U.K. chart, Richard\'s first British number one, with sales in excess of a million. It also became his first U.S. hit, reaching number 30 that fall. Today, it remains one of Richard\'s most instantly recognizable numbers, courtesy also of an anarchic revival he undertook in 1986 with the comedy troupe the Young Ones. Recorded in aid of the Comic Relief charity, this version, too, topped the British chart.  Appears On  Living Doll by Cliff Richard SongfactsLiving Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Living Doll by Cliff Richard Songfacts  Songfacts  This song was from the soundtrack to the film Serious Charge, which was Cliff Richard\'s movie debut. It was written by Lionel Bart who also wrote the West End and Broadway musical Oliver. It was originally intended for the singer Duffy Power before it was included in Serious Charge.  This was originally a Rock song, and as both Cliff and his backing band thought that a song about a blow-up doll was uncool, they originally weren\'t planning to record it. One of his backing musicians, Bruce Welch, suggested a slower tempo like a country song would work better, so they rearranged it into the now familiar form.  According to 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, Lionel Bart said, "I had taken it from one of those ads in the Sunday papers for a doll that did everything and I wrote it in 10 minutes flat."  In the UK, this was the biggest-selling single of 1959.  In 1986 Cliff did a humorous, anarchic re-recording of this for BBC\'s charity appeal Comic Relief. It featured the cast of BBC\'s comedy Young Ones series, which were Rik Mayall (Rick), Adrian Edmonson (Vyvyan), Nigel Planer (Neil) and Christopher Ryan (Mike). When it topped the UK chart Cliff became the first artist to have the same song in two different versions at number one. >>  Suggestion credit:  Edward Pearce - Ashford, Kent, England, for all above  This was the first of Cliff Richard 14 UK chart-toppers. He is the only act in the UK to achieve a #1 single in each of the first five decades since the inception of the UK singles chart in 1952.

Acmthompson  The island of Malta received the George Cross in recognition of its inhabitants’ gallantry in World War II. Recipients of this award may add G.C. after their names; the cross ranks second only to the Victoria Cross (the highest British military decoration). The cross is silver, with one side depicting St. George slaying the dragon and with the inscription “For Gallantry;” the other side gives the recipient’s name and the date of the award.  The George Medal, instituted at the same time as the George Cross, is analogous to it but is awarded for services not quite so outstanding as those which merit the George Cross. Recipients of this medal can add G.M. after their names. The medal is silver; one side has the effigy of the reigning British monarch, and the other side has St. George and the dragon with the inscription “The George Medal.”  Learn More in these related articles:  World War 2 Awards.com - George CrossWorld War 2 Awards.com - George Cross  George Cross  Number of awards in the database: 139  Total awarded for WW II:    139  Recipients A-Z  The George Cross -or GC- was instituted June 24th, 1941, by King George VI. This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously. Three women were awarded the GC for resistance activities in occupied  territories during WW 2. One of them was Noor Inayat Khan.

Since then, the plot of the novel has woven its way into popular culture: Captain Ahab and the hunt for the White Whale continue to spark adaptations, reworkings, and allusions, while the opening line, "Call me Ishmael," remains one of the most well-known first words in fiction. However, Ishmael both as narrator and character has been primarily the property of academic rather than popular culture. Particularly following F. O. Matthiessen s classic American Renaissance, published in 1941 in the midst of the Nazi aggression, Ishmael has been appropriated by critics intent upon finding in him the figure of resistance to totalitarianism and fulfillment of democratic freedom. Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity. But the Holocaust (the Shoah) effectively marks the final collapse of traditional Western humanism. Jewish thinkers such as George Steiner and Emmanuel Levinas have been reassessing this collapse and its consequences. Both suggest alternative Jewish humanisms that reread Western culture and literature through a "Holocaust hermeneutics" that ethicizes and morally impassions the act of reading, studying, and responding to texts, and that elevates the role of the textual and human Other to one of primacy and priority. Rereading Moby-Dick under Steinerian and Levinasian norms reveals an Ishmael whose dealings with the Other pose troubling ethical questions in a post-Shoah world, and challenges the traditional "Cold War consensus" that makes of Ishmael the American emblem of Western freedom and humanitarianism  Subject  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEAHey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe? | NEA  Hey Ishmael: Call Me Maybe?  December 18, 2015  CallMeIshmael.jpg  The rotary pay phones used for the Call Me Ishmael project. Photo by Logan Smalley  It started as so many good things do: over a drink. Logan Smalley and Stephanie Kent were at a bar one evening in New York when the conversation turned to books, and specifically, to first sentences of novels. In any such conversation, three words in particular are invariably mentioned: “Call me Ishmael,” the iconic opening of Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. What came next was a question that in hindsight, seems unthinkable no one had ever asked before: What if you really could call Ishmael? “We quickly realized that it was a pun worth keeping,” Smalley said.  Smalley and Kent set to work creating Call Me Ishmael , a platform for people to tell personal stories about books they love, with the hopes of connecting people with their next great read. They set up a cell phone number for Ishmael, which goes straight to voice mail and prompts people to anonymously leave a message about “a book you’ve loved and a story you’ve lived.” A few\xa0times a week, Smalley transcribes a message by typewriter, filming the text as it scrolls up the typewriter carriage in time to the audio.  Although Smalley is no literary luddite—he and Kent both read and e-read—he said this particular project called for something more tangible than is typical in our digital age. “[People] want to call a complete stranger and tell them the really profound and potentially really personal story about how a book has affected them,” said Smalley. “That exchange, to us, necessitates something that feels very handmade and safe and comfortable, and gets a legitimate treatment.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

God is awake.  \xa0  He who every morning plans the transaction of the day and follows out that plan, carries a thread that will guide him through the maze of the most busy life.

Published on Jan 2, 2009  One  wonderful  waltz  of   Johann Strauss  Johann Strauss II (October 25, 1825 -- June 3, 1899; also known as fully Johann Baptist Strauss, and Johann Strauss, Jr. was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria\'s approach was           significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte           Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste           Libeault of the Nancy           School . Faria\'s theoretical position, and the subsequent           experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant           contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of mile           Cou and the autogenic training techniques of Johannes           Heinrich Schultz .  Reichenbach  Rcamier, in 1821, prior to the           development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used           something resembling hypnoanesthesia and operated on patients under mesmeric coma.  In the 1840s and 1850s , Carl           Reichenbach began experiments to find any scientific validity to "mesmeric" energy, which he termed Odic           force after the Norse god Odin.

This period was known as the ‘golden age’ of Australian tennis.  In the 1960s, men's tennis open titles were dominated by six Australian men: Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Ken Rosewall, and Fred Stolle. Between 1961 and 1970, Australian men's tennis champions won at least one Open Singles title every year at either Wimbledon or the French or US Opens, as well as the Australian Open titles. In men's tennis, the golden age culminated in 1969 with Rod Laver's second Grand Slam win, as well as four major titles in the same year.  Margaret Court, courtesy of Australian Open  In 1970, Margaret Court also completed the Grand Slam. Court is one of only three women ever to win four international tennis open titles in one year. Indigenous player Evonne Goolagong Cawley was also a strong force in women's tennis in Australia in the 1970s with wins at Wimbledon, the French and the Australian Opens.  The ‘golden age’ for Australian tennis players declined from 1969 when amateur players were joined by professionals. Also by the 1980s, the Australian Open synchronised its dates to begin in January in line with the European, UK and USA players events schedule, which greatly widened the pool of players.  Yet even following the decline of Australia's dominance in the Grand Slam tournaments, tennis remained popular in urban areas and the Australian Open grows in popularity as a spectator sport.  Early tennis development 1900s–1950s  The golden age of Australian tennis was built on the early successes of both men's and women's tennis with Grand Slam tournament winners: Norman Brookes in the 1900s to 1919, Jack Crawford in the early 1930s, and Harry Hopman from 1929–39. This was in tandem with the consistent wins and popularity of women's tennis from the 1920s to the 1950s. Daphne Akhurst reached the Wimbledon final in 1925 and won the Doubles in 1928. From the1930s to the 1950s, Nancy Bolton got to the USA Singles Open and won other titles with her doubles partner, Thelma Long. Bolton was ranked No.4 in 1947 and stayed in that position until 1949.  This series of wins in the amateur Grand Slam tournament titles of the 1940s and 1950s was made possible by extensive community and industry support, and investment in the development and administration of amateur tennis players.  Harry Hopman, courtesy of Australian Open  Harry Hopman was a captain turned coach of 22 Australian Davis Cup teams between 1939 and 1967. As coach Hopman guided Australian male tennis players to 15 Davis Cup victories in 20 years. Ken Rosewall, Frank Sedgeman, John Bromwich, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Lew Hoad and Margaret Smith Court were all either trained by Harry Hopman or managed by Nell Hopman. ( The Hopman Era: Australia on the Rise)  Amateurs, tennis community and industry in the 1960s  By 1969 the game started to change. Professional players were invited to join the amateurs at the Grand Slam tournaments and prize money was offered for the first time, different tennis court surfaces and different game strategies emerged, and metal racquets were introduced.  Professional versus amateur  In 1969, the Australian Open Championships became 'open' to amateurs and professionals. This followed in the footsteps of the French Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, UK, and the USA Open. Rod Laver returned to win his second grand slam in 1969.  The advantages to amateur Australian champions who had enjoyed the riches of the Davis Cup endorsements soon disappeared with the advent of ‘open’ tennis.

This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries—even death.  Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is unexpectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite  Heathcliff’s clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine’s ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.  When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.  Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley’s cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father’s death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.  When he returns, he has mysteriously acquired wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to a baby girl, Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.  Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine’s post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.  Analysis  Despite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly’s narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!  Nelly’s judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.  It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.  All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.

According to local records , the Mexican piñata tradition began in the town of Acolman , just north of Mexico City , where piñatas were introduced for catechism purposes as well as to co-opt the Huitzilopochtli ceremony .

They are currently exhibited, free to the public, in the Duveen Gallery in the British Museum. Although today the sculptures appear white, originally they were painted in vivid colors, something that new research is revealing .  A marble frieze from the Parthenon, now displayed in the British Museum, depicts a procession of gods and mortals.  Credit: Mark Higgins Shutterstock  The marbles in London were removed from the Parthenon in the first decade of the 19th century under the auspices of Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin, and were first exhibited in London in 1807. Their removal is deeply controversial and the Greek government has requested that they be repatriated, a debate that has garnered extensive media attention. Not all the sculptures from the Parthenon are in the British Museum; another large portion is still in Athens, while a few other sculptures are in different museums throughout the world.  The Elgin Marbles once adorned the Parthenon in Athens.  Credit: Anastasios71 Shutterstock  The Parthenon  A temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is located on the Acropolis of ancient Athens. It is about 228 feet (69.5 meters) long by 101 feet (30.9 meters) wide and roughly 65 feet (20 meters) high. Construction of the temple started in 447 B.C., with work on its decorations continuing up to about 432 B.C., around the time war broke out with Sparta. At the time the Parthenon was created, Athens was at its height, the city’s vast navy helping it control an empire in the Aegean Sea.  There are three main types of sculptures on the exterior of the Parthenon that are now part of the Elgin Marbles.  Pediments  Pediments are large triangular shaped niches, which contained impressive sculptures, located high up on top of the Parthenon. One pediment is located on the east side of the building and another on the west. The sculptures on the east pediment tell the tale of the birth of the goddess Athena, while those on the west depict a battle between Athena and the god Poseidon to determine who would be the patron deity of Athens. The size of the sculptures varied depending on how close they were to the apex (the highest point) of the triangle.  The most impressive pediment sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles come from the east side and illustrate reactions to the birth of Athena.  According to myth, Athena was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Metis. Zeus was afraid that Athena would become more powerful than him so he swallowed Metis whole while she was pregnant. This did not stop the pregnancy and Athena became so big that Zeus’ head was split open with an axe by the Greek blacksmith god Hephaestus, and the goddess was born.  Unfortunately, the sculptures depicting the head-blowing birth have not survived but the sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles do show the reactions of Greek deities to the birth. British Museum curator Ian Jenkins notes in his book "The Parthenon Sculptures" (Harvard University Press, 2007) that Athena was born “at daybreak” and sculptures show “the sun-god Helios and the heads of two of his four horses,” emerging from the floor of the pediment, rising “as if from the sea.”  Also observing the event is a nude image of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry, who is shown reclining and apparently enjoying a cup of wine, as if toasting the birth. To the right are two seated goddesses who, Jenkins says, are probably Demeter and her daughter Persephone, while further to the right is a heavily draped Greek girl, apparently a mortal human, who has taken flight after viewing the event.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen.

Over time my products became more and more popular so the name Bodhi came about to keep it short and simple. Bodhi comes from the Bodhi Tree which is a type of fig tree. The Bodhi tree has played an important part in human history featuring strongly in religious history and mythology in various parts of the world.  The ficus religiosa, Bodhi tree, has large heart shaped leaves. It is one of the most sacred trees in India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it is venerated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The tree under which Siddhartha Gautama gained enlightenment over 2,600 years ago still grows today in North East India.  In Hindu religion, Vishnu is said to have been born under a Bodhi tree and is often depicted sitting on its heart-shaped leaves. The Bodhi tree is often planted in the grounds of temples and, of all the sacred trees of India, it is the most widely worshiped.  The Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka is located in Anuradhapura and is said to be the oldest tree in the world with a known planting date. This fig tree is said to have grown from a branch taken from the original Bodhi tree in India under which Buddha gained enlightenment.

It is the place where Prince Siddhartha Guatama, while meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.  Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it. As a young man, following the ancient traditions of Hinduism, he sought out spiritual teachers. Inquiring of their knowledge, he diligently practiced various yogas and meditations. Seven years passed, the last three in extreme asceticism, yet still he had not achieved his goal of enlightenment.  Impression of Buddha feet, Bodh Gaya \xa0\xa0\xa0  Siddhartha then journeyed toward the ancient sacred forests of Uruvela (modern Gaya in Bihar, in north India) with the intention of finally and completely realizing the infinite. Guided by visionary dreams and following in the footsteps of the Buddhas of three previous ages, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni and Kasyapa (who had each attained enlightenment at the site) Siddhartha sat beneath the Bodhi Tree. Touching the earth, thereby calling it to witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment, he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.  "Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve, but my body will not move from this seat until I have attained Enlightenment, so difficult to obtain in the course of great periods of time".  As Siddhartha sat in deep meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, Mara, the Dark Lord of Death, came to distract him from his endeavor. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama\'s words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Siddhartha\'s wisdom broke through Mara’s illusions. The power of his compassion transformed the demons\' weapons into flowers and Mara and all his forces fled. Three days and nights passed and Siddhartha’s intention was realized.

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule. The United States joined the war on the side of South     Vietnam in 1961, but withdrew combat troops in 1973. In 1975 North Vietnam     succeeded in taking control of South Vietnam.

Abstract  Malaria is a serious and common problem among travellers all over the world especially travellers travelling to Indonesia. This descriptive study focus on artemisinin-based therapy for malaria especially in Indonesia. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced from a plant called Artemisia annua. It is active against all Plasmodium species and its able to destroy all the blood stages of the parasite. Artemisinins causes less toxic effect if compared with other antimalarial agents. The year 2004 marks the beginning of adoption of artemisnin-based combination therapies (ACTs) into national malaria control program in Indonesia. 3 types of ACT which are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artemether-lumefantrine andartesunate-amodiaquine. have been used recently to treat uncomplicated malaria in Indonesia. Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives has been recently reported from Thailand-Cambodia border.

Article Outline  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  1. Introduction  Malaria is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito that usually bites from dusk to dawn which are infected by protozoan parasites species of Plasmodium genus. There are 4 types of Plasmodium which are Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae. In addition, P. knowlesi, a parasite of Old World (Eastern Hemisphere) monkeys, has been identified in South East Asia[1,2]. Estimation by The World Health Organization (WHO) of reported cases from Indonesia were 2.5 million in 2006. Papua (300,000) and East Nusa Tenggara (70,000) provinces were the highest provinces of clinical malaria cases, annually[3]. Based on the 2011 World Malaria Report, in 2010, 4.3 million malaria cases were reported, of which 2.4 million wereparasitologically confirmed. Three countries accounted for 94% of confirmed cases: India(66%), Myanmar(18%) and Indonesia (10%). A total of 2426 malaria deaths were reported from eight countries, the great majority (93%) in India, Indonesia and Myanmar. Indonesia reported little change in the incidence of malaria between the year 2010 and 2011[4]. According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Malaria is still present in most part of Indonesia. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria is present in Indonesia. Malaria is still endemic in all rural areas in Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara Barat; areas of Bali outside the main resort areas; all areas of eastern Indonesia including Papua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku and Maluku Utara; and Lombok island. There is no malaria transmission in Jakarta; main resort areas of Bali or the island of Java (with the exception of Menorah Hills, central Java, risk still prevails there); and urban areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara Barat. There is a low transmission in rural areas of Java[2]. In April 2001, WHO recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to minimize the burden caused by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to conventional anti-malarial medications such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine.

Lithuania Traveller Article:  Comments (5)  Changing money in Lithuania  Lithuania has its own currency which is the Lithuanian litas (LTL). Its symbol is simply "Lt", that is usually after the amount e.g. "3,82 Lt" . Each litas consists of 100 centas. Coins go as little as 1 centas to 5 litas, while banknotes (bills) go as from 10 litas to 500 litas.\xa0  The litas has been pegged to euro at the rate of 3.4528 LTL= 1 EUR \xa0since February 2002. Euro being the official peg currency makes commercial banks to follow Lithuanian Central Bank mandate (www.lb.lt) to not exceed 0.50 percent margin in commercial transactions. Lithuania has had hopes to join the EU monetary union in 2007 so the Euro would become the currency. SEB/Vilniaus Bankas (www.seb.lt) now claims no worries about converting to Euro and puts the best forecast for 2009. Thus among notable rates of exchange, it is roughly 4 litas to the pound sterling (2011). There is limited possibity to buy Litas outside of Lithuania so you have two main ways to get your spending money:  1. Take your own local currency and change it when you arrive. Go to a bank and you will find that the cashiers will exchange your money without the need for you to enter into any explanation. Just hand over the money and back will come the Lita. Some banks have a little machine inside the door with symbols on so that you just press the \'currency exchange\' button, receive a ticket with a number on and then wait for your turn.  2. The second way to obtain some spending money is take your bank card card to an cash machines (ATM) - be it Visa, Mastercard or any plain debit card bearring Cirrus logo. The machines will offer you a choice of languages when you insert your card. Select the appropriate one and then proceed as you would at home. The machines are common in the large cities in the sort of places that you would expect to find them - outside banks and supermarkets. Written wisdom tells that the ATM is almost impossible to find in small villages.

These dresses are paired with the images of the celebrities who wore them.

We grow our fruit, vegetables and tomatoes with care on farms that have been with us for generations. We preserve that wholesome goodness for families to nourish their loved ones with the best quality products. We want you to know what is in our food and help you make the best decisions for you and your family.\xa0  Even though the FDA, USDA, World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association have concluded that products containing genetically engineered ingredients are safe, Del Monte remains committed to meeting evolving consumer preferences and continues to explore Non-GMO ingredient alternatives where possible.  All of the fruit, vegetables and tomatoes in Del Monte products have always come from traditional breeding techniques and are not the result of any modern genetic engineering, or genetic modification (Non-GMO). 70 of our best-selling vegetable and tomato products are completely Non-GMO and can be found by looking for the Non-GMO label on the product.\xa0  Certain Del Monte products do contain added ingredients (like sweeteners or flavorings) that have been derived from genetically engineered corn or soybeans. Del Monte made a significant investment to convert these added ingredients to be Non-GMO. As a result, we plan to convert the majority of our vegetables and fruit cups and most of our tomato products to “Non-GMO” by the end of our 2016 pack season (Sept/Oct 2016).  In 2016, we worked with the USDA to verify our sweet corn products as non-genetically modified resulting in the USDA certification, "USDA Process Verified Non-GE/GMO".\xa0\xa0Del Monte is the first consumer products company ever to meet USDA’s strict criteria to qualify for their Non-GMO process verification program. This process goes to great lengths to ensure that Del Monte’s sweet corn is not mutated or impacted by “drift” pollination that can occur when our specialty sweet corn is grown in areas near genetically modified commodity corn. Look for the USDA Process Verified Non-GE/GMO claim on our corn products some time later this year.  For more information, please visit FAQs .  Non-BPA Products  Del Monte’s top priority is the quality and safety of our products.\xa0 For more than 40 years, BPA has been approved by the FDA for use in food contact applications, and can coatings containing BPA have played an essential part in food preservation.  In response to growing consumer and customer preference, we have been working closely with can manufacturers and lining suppliers to approve non-BPA internal can lining alternatives that meet both food safety and consumer quality requirements. Given the critical role in ensuring product safety and preserving quality, any replacement for BPA must first pass rigorous safety and quality testing before we will accept it for use in our products. If an alternative proves safe and effective in a particular application, we will pursue it.  For instance, we started transitioning to Non-BPA linings back in 2009 for some of our vegetable, fruit and tomato products where the new linings were proven safe and effective through test pack, shelf-life studies, and analytical testing.\xa0\xa0Starting with the 2016 fresh pack production, which begins | Question: From which country does the food brand Del Monte originate ?', ['usa', 'us'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7156'), ('Context: The term originates from the white colour of the wedding dress , which first became popular with Victorian era elites after Queen Victoria wore a white lace dress at her wedding .

Nijinsky is still the only winner of the English Triple Crown since World War II. For many years, it was considered unlikely that any horse would ever win the English Triple Crown again. In the winter of 2006/2007, however, trainer Jim Bolger was training his unbeaten colt Teofilo for the Triple Crown [2] and bookmaker William Hill plc was offering odds of only 12/1 against Teofilo winning the 2007 Triple Crown. However, the horse was withdrawn from the 2000 Guineas two days before the race after suffering a setback.  Since Nijinsky, only Nashwan (1989), Sea the Stars (2009), and Camelot (2012) have won both the Guineas and the Derby, and in addition, no Derby winner (including both Nashwan and Sea the Stars) has even entered the St. Leger since Reference Point in 1987, although this is primarily due to the impact it would have on a horse's stud value, which would not be the case for a horse who had already won the Guineas.

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ("Context: The Russian Empire 's role in the American Revolutionary War was part of a global conflict of colonial supremacy between the Thirteen Colonies and the Kingdom of Great Britain .

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

Displaying considerable    talent from a very early age, he was assistant organist at the small local church by the time he was ten. In 1836,    Verdi completed his first opera, "Rocester." The music from this work only survives in the composer\'s next opera,    "Oberto, Conte di San Bonifacio," which opened at La Scala in 1839. His next opera, "Un Giorno di Regno" ("King for a    Day"), was a complete failure and resolved Verdi to cancel his La Scala contract and give up music altogether.    The manager of La Scala, Bartolomeo Merelli, persuaded him to persevere and write his next opera - "Nabucodonosor"    ("Nebuchadnezzar"). This opera came to be called "Nabucco" and premiered in 1842 to great acclaim. His next two operas    - "I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata" and "Ernani" - secured Verdi\'s reputation as a major figure in the music world.    Between 1844 and 1850 Verdi composed at a tremendous rate. "Luisa Miller" in 1849 and "Stiffelio" in 1850 demonstrate    Verdi\'s maturing style and more flowing musical line. During his "middle period" Verdi wrote three of his most    successful operas: "Rigoletto," "Il Trovatore," and "La Traviata." In 1859, Verdi wrote "Un Ballo in Maschera" which,    like several of his other works, aroused the ire of the censors who objected to the representation of a rebellion    against a monarch. From 1861-65, after Napoleon III drove the Austrians from northern Italy, Verdi was elected to    represent Busseto in the newly-formed Italian parliament. During this time he wrote "La Forza del Destino" and "Don    Carlos."  In 1870, he accepted a commission to write an opera for the opening of the Suez Canal. The opera, "Aida," premiered    in both Cairo and Milan in 1871. Following the success of "Aida," Verdi retired to his estate Sant\'Agnata. In 1875,    the death of the great Italian novelist and patriot Alessandro Manzoni moved Verdi to complete a requiem mass that    had originally been intended to honor his noted compatriot, Gioacchino Rossini.  Verdi was drawn back to the opera    by his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, who introduced him to the celebrated Arrigo Boito. They both worked together on    "Otello," which premiered at La Scala in 1886. Verdi\'s last opera was the only other comedy he had written since the    disastrous "Un Giorno di Regno" - "Falstaff," considered Verdi\'s humanistic swan song.  In January, 1901, Verdi became    ill while staying in Milan. City officials spread the streets around his hotel with straw so that the sound of the    horses\' hooves would not disturb him. He passed away on January 27, 1901, and was buried at the Casa di Riposo, a    retirement home for elderly musicians that was established by Verdi himself.  - from the New York City Opera  The Creation of Falstaff  "It is not often that a man\'s strength is so immense that he can remain an athlete after bartering half of it to    old age for experience; but the thing happens occasionally, and need not so greatly surprise us in Verdi\'s case,"   said George Bernard Shaw of "Falstaff." By the 1890s, even after some 15 years of retirement from opera, Verdi\'s    reputation as the preeminent composer of Italian opera was as secure as it had been for decades. After the premiere    of "Otello" in 1887, the world assumed it had heard its last from Verdi.

Byker Grove was the original idea of late TV executive Andrea Wonfor. In 1987, Andrea approached veteran soap writer Adele Rose. Together they created a single pilot episode featuring kids aged 8–11 at an out-of-school club (transmitted on Tyne Tees TV in 1988). In autumn 1988, Andrea got backing from Anna Home, then Head of drama, BBC TV. Anna gave the green light for a run of a series of six 25-minute episodes on BBC TV. The age of the main characters was raised to 12-16 after support from first producer-director, Matthew Robinson . The first series therefore centred on young teenagers crossing the bridge from childhood to adulthood. Although some of the action took place outside the youth club, the series was unusual among dramas in that the characters were rarely shown in school. One of the major settings was the foster home run by the kindly but strict Lou Gallagher, the longest-running character.  \xa0 Famous people  Byker Grove launched the careers of Anthony McPartlin ("P.J.") and Declan Donnelly ("Duncan") who are otherwise known as Ant & Dec as well as the actress Jill Halfpenny , Donna Air , former CBBC presenter Andrew Hayden-Smith and Emmerdale actors Dale Meeks , Charlie Hardwick and Victoria Hawkins . Also appearing in the series was the now glamour model Francoise Boufhal ("Ellie Baines"). Founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson who, after Byker Grove, became executive producer of EastEnders , Head of Drama BBC Wales and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia . It was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen Mamma Mia , the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham ( This Life , Doctor Who and co-creator of BBC One\'s Life on Mars ). The first writer was Adele Rose - in Series 1 she wrote eps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, her daughter, Carrie Rose, writing ep 5 - and the most prolific was Brian B. Thompson , who wrote 50 episodes over 12 series. Tom Hooper directed four episodes of the show in 1997. [1] Charlie Hunnam now stars in American TV series Sons of Anarchy .  \xa0 Production  \xa0 The Mitre , also known as Benwell Towers, acted as the production offices and the fictional youth club.  Byker Grove was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle . The actual youth club set was in Benwell , which is in the west area of the City, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne & Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the famous architecture that is the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) are used for filming backdrops.  The "youth club" building which is what the viewers see onscreen, known as The Mitre used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 90s) before it was bought by Zenith Television , who film the series. The building housed the actual set, production offices, make up suite and costume department. Currently the property is semi-vacant, and the Zenith North Television signs have been removed outside the building.  The final series started on 7 October 2006 on the CBBC Channel. Richard Deverell , head of CBBC, was interviewed on Newsround about the decision to axe Byker Grove. [2]  The eighteenth and last series of Byker Grove was produced by Tim Holloway, who also produced Casualty from 2000 until 2002.  On 11 March 2008, it was reported that Gallowgate Productions TV, the TV production company owned by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, purchased the rights to Byker Grove after the production company that made it ( Zenith Entertainment ) went into liquidation in 2007.

Published on Nov 8, 2014  This video is about Mitochondrial Eve  The idea that a African Woman, “Mitochondrial Eve", is the woman from whom all people on earth inherit their DNA  Is proven to be a scientific  fact.  In the field of human genetics, the name Mitochondrial Eve refers to the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living anatomically modern humans,  She is from Africa, & is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago.  This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend.  The dating for "Eve" was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis and a boost to the theory of the origin and dispersion of modern humans from Africa.  The biblical connotation was very clear from the start.  1 January 1987 in Nature, in which their findings clearly showed that all current human mtDNA originated from a single population from Africa.  mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or matrilineally.  The Human MRCA studies, confirm that All humans alive today share a surprisingly recent common African ancestor, This is true, even for people born on different continents.  Category  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through ...Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  by John Taylor  Background:  In human genetics, Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans. This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend, in an unbroken line, on their mother’s side, and through the mothers of those mothers, and so on, back until all lines converge on one woman, who is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago. Because all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) generally (but see paternal mtDNA transmission) is passed from mother to offspring without recombination, all mtDNA in every living person is directly descended from hers by definition, differing only by the mutations that over generations have occurred in the germ cell mtDNA since the conception of the original “Mitochondrial Eve”.  Mitochondrial Eve is named after mitochondria and the biblical Eve. Unlike her biblical namesake, she was not the only living human female of her time. However, her female contemporaries, excluding her mother, failed to produce a direct unbroken female line to any living person in the present day.  Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived between 99,000 and 200,000 years ago, most likely in East Africa, when Homo sapiens sapiens (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species.  Origin of the name:  Cann, Stoneking and Wilson did not use the term “Mitochondrial Eve” or even the name “Eve” in their original paper; it appears to be a catchy term popularised by the media. The name appeared in a 1987 article in Science by Roger Lewin, headlined “The Unmasking of Mitochondrial Eve.” The biblical connotation was very clear from the start.

As a youth he divulged talent both as a singer and instrumentalist, serving as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and as the first-chair bassoonist in the National Youth Orchestra. He studied music at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied music and was a choral scholar. He was later mentored by renowned British conductor and musicologist Edward Downes. Elder worked briefly in minor capacities at Glyndeboune and Covent Garden before gaining experience conducting Verdi operas as a regular conductor at the Sydney Opera House, Australia from 1972 to 1974.

The original abbey was burned down in 1307, and the present building dates from the 15th century.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0By the early 18th century Paisley had developed into a manufacturing centre for the hand-loom weaving of linen. At the end of the century the new town was laid out over much of the ground that once belonged to the abbey. Paisley became famous for its paisley shawls in silk and cotton (and later in wool), which were copies of the Asian shawls sent by British soldiers serving in India. A priceless collection is on exhibit in the Paisley Museum and Art Galleries. Later the manufacture of linen thread gave way to that of cotton, and Paisley grew rapidly. Paisley\'s workers were noted for their radical politics.  \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The town\'s modern industry includes engineering, chemicals, food processing, microelectronics, and computer systems as well as a range of service activities. Paisley has many fine buildings, including the town hall, public library and museum, the Coats Observatory, and the Thomas Coats Memorial Church.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

Traditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and HullsTraditional Maritime Skills :: Caulking Decks and Hulls  Caulking Decks and Hulls  Introduction  Caulking is defined by driving oakum, cotton or general rope fibres in the seams of a ship's wooden deck or side / hull to make it watertight. It also plays a structural role in tightening up the hull / deck of a ship and reduces the longitudinal movement of neighbouring planks.  It is very easy to demonstrate the principles behind caulking a vessel, however, it is a skill where practice is\xa0 important but also individual vessels present their own issues. Usually you will have to warm to the task, understand which iron you\xa0 have to use, and how much oakum. There is a lot in the skill that simply comes from experience and new builds present different\xa0 issues to old boats.  The final pitching of the seam was not demonstrated because it was not occurring at the time of the\xa0 demonstration.  Procedure  The process is demonstrated in the accompanying video clips with a step-by-step guide. The conversation with the boat builder, in this case, Chris Rees is unscripted and covers the technique from his experience.  The technique is very simple but the subtleties come with experience:  Clean the seam to be caulked.  Twist a length of caulking material (oakum or cotton).

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts.  The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region.  The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. While some of the northern outposts of Aragon are inaccessible in winter because of snow, the region is, on the whole, fairly dry, enjoying a humid, Mediterranean-style climate in many areas.  Like most of Spain, Aragon was under the domination of the Moors from the 8th to the 14th centuries. However, many Muslims decided to remain in Aragon after the Christian Re-conquest, resulting in a style of architecture that is unique to Aragon.  Mudejar – meaning “those who are allowed to stay” – is a form of architecture employing bricks, plaster and the repetitive geometric patterns characteristic of early Islamic art. The buildings are finished off with ceramic tiles. The city of Teruel and the town of Calatayud are home to some of the best examples of Mudejar architecture.  Aragon may be best known for the marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla in 1469, which effectively created modern Spain. Their youngest daughter, Katherine of Aragon, became the first queen of Henry VIII of England.  Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in Spain, and funded Christopher Columbus’ expedition to America in 1492. For these accomplishments, they were dubbed “The Catholic Monarchs” by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. Everywhere in Aragon, there are reminders of the long, colorful history of Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign.  Abiding traditions  Aragon is steeped in tradition, and bull fighting and bull running play a major part in Aragonese culture. Most towns and villages hold some sort of bull festival in September; people who have issues with the ethics of bull fighting may be uncomfortable living in a region where the traditional is such an intrinsic part of local culture.  Aragon is also famous for the Jota, an energetic 17th-century dance particular to the region. While the flamenco, which originated in Andalucia, is now performed all over Spain, the Jota remains the proud possession of Aragonese culture. Both men and women perform the Jota, which involves a lot of noise and leaping around.  Moving to Aragon  Aragon has a population of around 1.3 million, of which over 10%, or about 173,000, are foreigners.  These come from all over the world, as there is significant foreign investment in the region. General Motors, Bosch Siemens and Adidas all have major plants in Aragon.  Property prices in Aragon are very competitive. On average, houses in Aragon are 56% cheaper than the national average.  Away from the regional capital of Zaragoza, which houses more than half of the region’s population, Aragon is sparsely populated. There are only two other cities– Teruel and Huesca – in all of Aragon. For those who want to get away from it all, Aragon is the place to do it.

Mr Pilkington has a larger but more unkempt farm , and is on bad terms with Mr Frederick of Pinchfield Farm . Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber . Through Napoleon 's human aide Mr. Whymper , Napoleon furiously learns that Frederick got the timber for free as he paid in counterfeit money . Napoleon orders the slogan `` Death to Pilkington '' changed to `` Death to Frederick '' . Immediately after the bum deal , Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm , killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder . Napoleon parlays his new `` Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy , but this proves too little too late as the `` Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory , and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads `` Serves you right '' . | Question: who said serves you right in animal farm ?", ['Pilkington'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-81279'), ("Context: `` Lessons '' is the 19th episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation and was originally aired in the United States on April 5 , 1993 , in broadcast syndication .

The U.S. Senate voted in favor of ratifying it with amendments on April 25 , 1854 , and then transmitted it to 14th President Franklin Pierce . Mexico 's government and its General Congress or Congress of the Union took final approval action on June 8 , 1854 . The purchase was the last substantial territorial acquisition in the contiguous United States . The U.S. sought the land as a better route for the construction of the southern transcontinental railway line , and the financially - strapped government of Antonio López de Santa Anna agreed to the sale , which netted Mexico $10 million ( equivalent to $270 million in 2017 ) . After the devastating loss of Mexican territory to the U.S. in the Mexican - American War ( 1846 -- 48 ) and the continued filibustering by U.S. citizens , Santa Anna may have calculated it was better to yield territory by treaty and receive payment rather than have the territory simply seized by the U.S. | Question: what country did the united states buy the gadsden purchase from ?", ['James Gadsden'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-21014'), ("Context: Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats , head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event , `` Wait ' til you see Steph Curry .

This introduced a £ 10 income tax allowance per child , for tax payers earning under £ 500 per annum . Following extensive Parliamentary debate , the Budget became law as the Finance Act ( 1909 -- 1910 ) 1910 on 29 April 1910 . Since the income tax rate was then 1 shilling , two pence in the pound ( 5.83 % ) , the value of the tax credit was therefore 11 shillings and eight pence per child . Since most people did not earn enough to pay tax , this was a subsidy for middle class parents . The nominal value of these tax credits were generally , though not always , increased in line with income tax rates . For instance , by 1916 , income tax had increased to five shillings in the pound ( 25 % ) , and the tax credit to £ 25 , giving a value of the tax credit of £ 6 5 shillings . | Question: when did child tax credit start in uk ?", ['1910'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-432'), ("Context: With no monarch , most modern republics use the title president for the head of state .

The school consisted of Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Empedocles.  It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus.  The Pluralists rejected the idea that the diversity of nature can be reduced to a single principle (monism).  Anaxagoras posited that nature contained an innumerable number of principles, while Empedocles reduced nature to four elements (fire, air, earth, and water) which could not be reduced to one another and which would be sufficient to explain change and diversity.   Leucippus  Leucippus ( ; Greek: Λεύκιππος , "Leúkippos"; fl.  5th cent.  BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory.  However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed.  As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus\'s word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century.  Furthermore, in his "Corpus Democriteum", Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus.  The present consensus among the world\'s historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical.
