Over time my products became more and more popular so the name Bodhi came about to keep it short and simple. Bodhi comes from the Bodhi Tree which is a type of fig tree. The Bodhi tree has played an important part in human history featuring strongly in religious history and mythology in various parts of the world.  The ficus religiosa, Bodhi tree, has large heart shaped leaves. It is one of the most sacred trees in India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it is venerated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The tree under which Siddhartha Gautama gained enlightenment over 2,600 years ago still grows today in North East India.  In Hindu religion, Vishnu is said to have been born under a Bodhi tree and is often depicted sitting on its heart-shaped leaves. The Bodhi tree is often planted in the grounds of temples and, of all the sacred trees of India, it is the most widely worshiped.  The Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka is located in Anuradhapura and is said to be the oldest tree in the world with a known planting date.

It is the place where Prince Siddhartha Guatama, while meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.  Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it. As a young man, following the ancient traditions of Hinduism, he sought out spiritual teachers. Inquiring of their knowledge, he diligently practiced various yogas and meditations. Seven years passed, the last three in extreme asceticism, yet still he had not achieved his goal of enlightenment.  Impression of Buddha feet, Bodh Gaya \xa0\xa0\xa0  Siddhartha then journeyed toward the ancient sacred forests of Uruvela (modern Gaya in Bihar, in north India) with the intention of finally and completely realizing the infinite. Guided by visionary dreams and following in the footsteps of the Buddhas of three previous ages, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni and Kasyapa (who had each attained enlightenment at the site) Siddhartha sat beneath the Bodhi Tree. Touching the earth, thereby calling it to witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment, he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.  "Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve, but my body will not move from this seat until I have attained Enlightenment, so difficult to obtain in the course of great periods of time".  As Siddhartha sat in deep meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, Mara, the Dark Lord of Death, came to distract him from his endeavor. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama\'s words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Siddhartha\'s wisdom broke through Mara’s illusions. The power of his compassion transformed the demons\' weapons into flowers and Mara and all his forces fled. Three days and nights passed and Siddhartha’s intention was realized. He became the Buddha, meaning the ‘Enlightened One’.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: The competition in which the club has had the most success is the European Cup ( now known as the UEFA Champions League ) ; they have won three European Cups , the first of which came in 1968 ; this win made them the first English club to win the European Cup .

On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

The Bodhi tree has played an important part in human history featuring strongly in religious history and mythology in various parts of the world.  The ficus religiosa, Bodhi tree, has large heart shaped leaves. It is one of the most sacred trees in India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it is venerated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The tree under which Siddhartha Gautama gained enlightenment over 2,600 years ago still grows today in North East India.  In Hindu religion, Vishnu is said to have been born under a Bodhi tree and is often depicted sitting on its heart-shaped leaves. The Bodhi tree is often planted in the grounds of temples and, of all the sacred trees of India, it is the most widely worshiped.  The Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka is located in Anuradhapura and is said to be the oldest tree in the world with a known planting date. This fig tree is said to have grown from a branch taken from the original Bodhi tree in India under which Buddha gained enlightenment.

Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it.

Impression of Buddha feet, Bodh Gaya \xa0\xa0\xa0  Siddhartha then journeyed toward the ancient sacred forests of Uruvela (modern Gaya in Bihar, in north India) with the intention of finally and completely realizing the infinite. Guided by visionary dreams and following in the footsteps of the Buddhas of three previous ages, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni and Kasyapa (who had each attained enlightenment at the site) Siddhartha sat beneath the Bodhi Tree. Touching the earth, thereby calling it to witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment, he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.  "Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve, but my body will not move from this seat until I have attained Enlightenment, so difficult to obtain in the course of great periods of time".  As Siddhartha sat in deep meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, Mara, the Dark Lord of Death, came to distract him from his endeavor. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama\'s words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Siddhartha\'s wisdom broke through Mara’s illusions. The power of his compassion transformed the demons\' weapons into flowers and Mara and all his forces fled. Three days and nights passed and Siddhartha’s intention was realized.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: The competition in which the club has had the most success is the European Cup ( now known as the UEFA Champions League ) ; they have won three European Cups , the first of which came in 1968 ; this win made them the first English club to win the European Cup .

You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Unlike Beverly , he is realistic about his children 's abilities and believes she smothers them too much . Despite his apathetic tendencies at home , he values hard work and has held various full time positions since his teenage years . Though he does not always show affection for his children , calling them morons when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways , he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves . He runs his father - in - law 's furniture business , loves sports , and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his white briefs .

Though seemingly untalented in every way ( except in ice hockey and wrestling , at which he excels ) , he remains highly self - assured while trying to become popular in high school .

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures. Star exhibits include two views of the River Thames by Canaletto and Haymaking by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  Another of the city’s new attractions is totally different.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: The Dutch East India Company ( in the Dutch of the day : Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie , or VOC ) decided to establish a permanent settlement at the Cape .

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter.

And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.

In 2004, he said: "People are crying out for a kind of Ronseal politics - they want it to do what it says on the tin."  People use the phrase every day.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: The Dutch East India Company ( in the Dutch of the day : Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie , or VOC ) decided to establish a permanent settlement at the Cape .

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Movie Review - - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE ...Movie Review -    - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE - NYTimes.com  SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE  By JANET MASLIN  Published: March     9, 1984  THOUGH Ron Howard's comedies don't adhere to any familiar formulas - Mr. Howard's funny ''Night Shift'' was about a prostitution ring operating out of a morgue, and his even more disarming new ''Splash'' is about a mermaid in Manhattan - they have a comfortably old-fashioned flavor. ''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.

Go  Why do Americans call it a period and the British a full stop?  Cheers, Susan  IP  \xa0  I really don\'t know for sure, Susan, but my hunch (from what I know about our history) is that we call it a period just to be different from the British. That doesn\'t mean that the word was just "invented" by Americans. Actually, the word period used to mean the punctuation mark placed to signal the end of a sentence goes back to the early 16th century, if I remember right. So there is justification for calling it a period rather than a full stop.  After the Americans won their independence from Great Britain, the famous dictionary compiler, Noah Webster, determined that we should try to do things as differently from the British as possible to separate ourselves psychologically as much as we could. In that vein he changed lots of spellings. For example colour/color; gaol/jail; Geoffrey/Jeffery; tyre/tire). I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s why we now say period and the British say full stop.  (By the way, I\'ve always thought it silly to say full stop. A stop is a stop. How can you have a "full" stop? Can you have a "partial" stop as well? Would that be a comma? In that case, I\'d call it a "momentary stop," not a "partial" stop!  )  We even went so far as to change our table manners. When the British cut some food on their plates, they hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand. Then they pick the cut food up with the fork, still held in the left hand, and bring it to their mouths. Americans, in contrast, cut the food the same way, but then put down the knife and take the fork with their right hands. Then they bring the cut food to their mouths.  I know I\'ve gotten off the topic, but I thought you might find this interesting. There was a lot of psychology going on back in the early years of our independence from Great Britain, Susan!

Since the Americans want to be different from the British, I wonder why they i.e the Americans have spoken their language at first. They could have spoken Spanish, for example.  PS. You, the Americans try to be different form the British in grammar, vocabulary, spelling and pronunciation. And we, the learners of English take full credit to cope with such differences!

It was true in the past that, in declaring ourselves independent, out nation\'s founders tended to divorce ourselves from everything British. For example, at the beginning of our nation, we wanted to avoid any kind of royalty in a government, so great efforts were taken to make sure that a president could not be a king. And, people strove to make many concepts in language and writing different, too.  However, at some times now, and in some circles, things British are very much admired and copied.  People who love the British are called Anglophiles, and we have quite a few of them in the United States.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand.

The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil . '' In Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 ( 1951 ) , the Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is `` excessive '' under the Eighth Amendment if it were `` a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial . | Question: what does excessive bail mean in the eighth amendment ?", ["a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial"], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-84583'), ('Context: Spermatogenesis takes place within several structures of the male reproductive system .

The George Cross superseded the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry (commonly known as the Empire Gallantry Medal).  George Cross medal engraved on a tombstone.  Acmthompson  The island of Malta received the George Cross in recognition of its inhabitants’ gallantry in World War II. Recipients of this award may add G.C. after their names; the cross ranks second only to the Victoria Cross (the highest British military decoration). The cross is silver, with one side depicting St. George slaying the dragon and with the inscription “For Gallantry;” the other side gives the recipient’s name and the date of the award.  The George Medal, instituted at the same time as the George Cross, is analogous to it but is awarded for services not quite so outstanding as those which merit the George Cross. Recipients of this medal can add G.M. after their names.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously. Three women were awarded the GC for resistance activities in occupied  territories during WW 2. One of them was Noor Inayat Khan.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence. Those proceedings have been protracted and sometimes arcane, but Siegel and Shuster’s names were eventually restored to the credits pages of all Superman comics, and Siegel’s heirs were ultimately successful | Question: The rights to which famous character were sold by creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster to Detective Comics for $130 in 1937?', ['superman', 'superman character', 'superman comics'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2367'), ("Context: Dragon Ball Super ( Japanese : ドラゴンボール 超 ( スーパー ) , Hepburn : Doragon Bōru Sūpā ) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation that began airing on July 5 , 2015 and ended on March 25 , 2018 .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil . '' In Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 ( 1951 ) , the Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is `` excessive '' under the Eighth Amendment if it were `` a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial . | Question: what does excessive bail mean in the eighth amendment ?", ["a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial"], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-84583'), ('Context: Spermatogenesis takes place within several structures of the male reproductive system .

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously.

Storm Thorgerson had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour , and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics , eventually deciding that the songs were , in general , concerned with `` unfulfilled presence '' , rather than Barrett 's illness . This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band .

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

The young comic book creators sold Superman to the publisher for a mere $130 (split between the two of them). Their character would of course go on to inspire an entire genre of superhero fiction across all mediums and generate millions upon millions of dollars in sales of comic books, movie tickets and other countless forms of merchandise.This hugely important document was released into the world Monday morning by The Infinite Horizon writer Gerry Duggan in the form of a digital image via Twitter , where it went viral among comics industry users. Among them was Invincible Iron Man and Casanova writer Matt Fraction, who observed that Detective Comics Publisher Jack Liebowitz, who signed the check, misspelled both of Siegel and Shuster’s names. The careless error was among the first of many indignities the pair would suffer in their dealings with Liebowitz, DC Comics and later-DC parent Time Warner, the corporation whom Siegel’s heirs continue to battle in copyright court even now.  The check was obtained by Stephen Fishler of ComicConnect.com and Metropolis Comics, companies specializing in rare comics collectibles. The check will be made available for auction in November along with other items once owned by Jerry Siegel . Rob Reynolds, ComicConnect’s Director of Consignments, tells CA that the check will likely be auctioned early 2012. Fishler issued Bleeding Cool a statement discussing the provenance of the check and the various amounts and stamps that appear on it:  This March 1, 1938 Detective Comics check, signed by Jack Liebowitz is made payable to Jerome Seigel and Joe Schuster. (You would think that the payment for a character as important as Superman, DC would have spelled Siegel and Shuster’s name correctly!) The check, in the amount of $412, includes an accounting of the items being paid for. At the very top is “Superman $130,” Next is the payment for the June 1938 Detective Comics at $210. Following that are payments of $36 each for Adventure Comics and More Fun. It would also appear that DC Comics used this check as evidence in their 1939 lawsuit against Victor Fox, given the fact that the evidence stamp from this case is clearly visible on the reverse of the check, as are the actual endorsement signatures of Siegel and Shuster themselves.  The 1939 lawsuit to which Fishler refers is that of Detective Comics, Inc. v. Bruns Publications, Inc., in which DC successfully argued that a competing publisher’s character called Wonder Man infringed upon the Superman copyright. The case is regarded as the first comic book copyright lawsuit, making Siegel and Shuster’s check that much more significant a piece of American comics history.  Additionally, Fischler observed that the date of the check, March 1, 1938, is also the date atop the original contract between Siegel, Shuster and DC that transfered ownership of the Superman character to the publisher in exchange for $130.  (Image via Jeff Trexler )  In the years subsequent to signing the above contract and cashing the above check, Siegel and Shuster would attempt to regain via the courts some kind of ownership of Superman and a more equitable share in the enormous profits generated by Superman comic books as well as DC’s exploitation of the character in the broader marketplace. The pair were at first unsuccessful and found themselves fired, unrecognized for their creation and consequently destitute (Shuster is alleged in comics historian Craig Yoe’s book, Secret Identity, to have illustrated a series of underground fetish comics just to make ends meet). Additional lawsuits, settlements and copyright extensions followed in the decades hence.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.

The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. At any moment in time many individual lattice atoms will be away from their perfect lattice sites and this interferes with electron movement.  When the temperature coefficient is known, an adjusted resistivity value can be computed using the following formula:  R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1–T2)]  Where: R1 = resistivity value adjusted | Question: What electrical property, the reciprocal of resistivity, has the SI units Siemens per metre?', ['conductivity'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4196'), ("Context: It is an allusion to Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ( 1798 ) .

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.  Since the majority of consumers said that their favourite sweets were either strawberry or blackcurrant flavoured, Fox\'s has also created a new product | Question: What animal is traditionally seen in the branding of Fox\'s Glacier Mints?', ['polar bear'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2327'), ("Context: Eric McCormack as Will Truman : The first titular protagonist to the show , Will is a gay man who is a successful corporate lawyer who studied at Columbia University , where he met Grace as a freshman ; they have been best friends ever since .

The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity.  Electrical Conductivity  Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. An interesting side note is that commercially pure copper products now often have IACS conductivity values greater than 100% IACS because processing techniques have improved since the adoption of the standard in 1913 and more impurities can now be removed from the metal.  Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value.  Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials.  Electrical Resistivity  Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators.  The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units. As mentioned above resistivity values are simply the reciprocal of conductivity so conversion between the two is straightforward. For example, a material with two micro ohm centimeter of resistivity will have Â½ microSiemens/centimeter of conductivity. Resistivity values in microhm centimeters units can be converted to % IACS conductivity values with the following formula:  172.41 / resistivity = % IACS  Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity  As noted above, electrical conductivity values (and resistivity values) are typically reported at 20 oC. This is done because the conductivity and resistivity of material is temperature dependant. The conductivity of most materials decreases as temperature increases. Alternately, the resistivity of most material increases with increasing temperature. The amount of change is material dependant but has been established for many elements and engineering materials.  The reason that resistivity increases with increasing temperature is that the number of imperfection in the atomic lattice structure increases with temperature and this hampers electron movement. These imperfections include dislocations, vacancies, interstitial defects and impurity atoms. Additionally, above absolute zero, even the lattice atoms participate in the interference of directional electron movement as they are not always found at their ideal lattice sites. Thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. At any moment in time many individual lattice atoms will be away from their perfect lattice sites and this interferes with electron movement.  When the temperature coefficient is known, an adjusted resistivity value can be computed using the following formula:  R1 = R2 * [1 + a * (T1–T2)]  Where: R1 = resistivity value adjusted | Question: What electrical property, the reciprocal of resistivity, has the SI units Siemens per metre?', ['conductivity'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4196'), ("Context: It is an allusion to Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ( 1798 ) .

Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves.

William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...  May I submit for inclusion, Your Honour, this most British of all lawyers...  This proud, this defiant Old Bailey Hack...  With his best gal, Hilda, She Who Must Be Obeyed, standing, NOT amused, by his side...  The one, the only...  HORACE RUMPOLE.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen.

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000. Westwood has performed particularly well in European Tour events, having won a total of 18 tournaments, and in 2000 he achieved the European Tour Order of Merit, ending Colin Montgomerie’s seven year run of victory.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures. Star exhibits include two views of the River Thames by Canaletto and Haymaking by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  Another of the city’s new attractions is totally different.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...  May I submit for inclusion, Your Honour, this most British of all lawyers...  This proud, this defiant Old Bailey Hack...  With his best gal, Hilda, She Who Must Be Obeyed, standing, NOT amused, by his side...  The one, the only...  HORACE RUMPOLE.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK).

After being inspired by watching Jack Nicklaus play golf in the early seventies Faldo had his first introduction to the game, quickly achieving success in 1975 by winning both the English Amateur Championship and the British Youths Championship.  In 1976, Faldo became a professional golfer, making his mark by finishing in eighth place on his first European tour and in 1977 he became the youngest player ever to play as part of the Ryder Cup team. During the eighties, Faldo took some time out of competition to improve his swing under the instruction of golfer turned tutor David Leadbetter.  Following the changes made to his game, Faldo returned to competitive golf and won his first major championship title in the 1987 Open Championship. Since then, in addition to his championship success, Faldo has won a series of high profile competitions and tour events including the French Open, Irish Open, Spanish Open, the PGA, the British Masters and the European Open. He has also had several team successes including the Alfred Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the Ryder Cup.  Colin Montgomerie  Affectionately known as ‘Monty,’ Colin Montgomerie is a legendary Scottish golfer and is widely recognised as the leading golfer to have emerged in European competition over the last fifteen years. Montgomerie was a successful amateur golfer, winning the Scottish Youths Championship in 1983, before turning professional in 1988 and winning the Rookie of the Year title on the European Tour that same year.  He won his first professional title in 1989, when he won the Portugese Open and since then, he has won more European titles than any other British Golfer. During the nineties, Montgomerie went on to win numerous tournaments on the European Tour including the Scandinavian Masters in 1991, the Volvo German Open in 1995, the Murphy’s Irish Open in 1996 and 1997 and the Volvo PGA Championship in 1998.  Between 1993 and 1999 Montgomerie won a record breaking seven ‘Order of Merit Titles’ on the tour and twenty high profile tournaments during that time, winning five titles in 1999 alone, being known as the most consistent golfer in the world during his most successful period. Since his seven year European winning streak, Montgomerie has continued to prove himself, most notably in the year 2000 when he made the record books again by winning the Volvo PGA Championship for the third time.  In 2001 he won the Australian Masters and in 2002 he won his first Asian title in the TCL classic in China. Montgomerie has taken part in eight Ryder Cups during his career, as well as other team tournaments, including the Dunhill Cup, the World Cup and the UBS Cup. Whilst never having won a major championship title, despite coming a close second at both the US Open and the US PGA, Montgomerie is regarded as one of the finest sportsmen in Britain, officially marked in 2004 when he was awarded an OBE for sporting achievement.  Lee Westwood  Regarded as one of England and Europe’s finest golfers, Lee Westwood began playing golf at the age of thirteen before winning his first amateur tournament, the Pete McEvoy Trophy aged seventeen. After winning the British Youth Championship in 1993, Westwood turned professional, winning his first professional competition four years later at the Volvo Scandinavian Masters.  Whilst Westwood has not won any major championships, he did attain fourth place in the official World Golf Rankings when he came forth in the 2000 British open. He has also won several high profile competitions, including the Freeport McDermott Classic in 1998, the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in 1996 and for the following two years, and the Cisco World Match Play Championship in 2000.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: Albertín Aroldis Chapman de la Cruz ( Spanish : ( aˈɾoldis ˈtʃapman ) ; born February 28 , 1988 ) is a Cuban - American professional baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can\'t wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read "Snow," Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, "felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf."  He has spoken up for others in peril.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

Image courtesy of Geoscience Australia.  The continent of Australia is referred to as an island because it is surrounded by ocean. However, Australia is actually made up of more than 8,000 islands, including the island state of Tasmania.  As an island, Australia is a natural quarantine zone. This means we are able to keep out many of the pests and diseases, such as rabies and papaya fly, that ravage other parts of the world. It also means we have some of the most unique animals and plants in the world. Many of our islands feature animals and wildlife that are unique to the islands due to their isolation from threats.  Norfolk Island  Norfolk Island is located far off the east coast of Australia. It is 1610 kilometres ENE of Sydney and 1456 km ESE of Brisbane. The Island is a volcanic outcrop 8km long and 5km wide.  Norfolk Island is the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the Southwest Pacific. In March 1788, just after the colony of New South Wales was established, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King and 22 settlers (including nine male and six female convicts) landed at what is now Kingston, Norfolk Island. In 1806, the government of the time decided the island was too difficult and costly to maintain. The inhabitants were transferred to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and all buildings were destroyed to discourage unauthorised settlers.  A second settlement was established in 1825. This time the island was to be a penal colony for the worst convicts from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. It was officially described as 'a place of the extremist punishment, short of death'. Conditions were harsh and many convicts died from disease, murder and failed escape attempts. Convict labour was used to construct the main buildings on the island, which remain standing to this day. In 1855, the island was abandoned as a penal colony and convicts transferred (again) to Van Diemen's Land.  The third settlement was the following year. One hundred and ninety-four men, women and children made the 3,700 mile, five week journey from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island. Almost all of them were descendants of the Bounty mutineers, the British naval officers involved in the1789 mutiny against Captain William Bligh.  Today, Norfolk Island is home to 1,800 permanent residents. Thirty-five per cent are descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Due to the number of shared surnames, many of the descendents are listed in the local telephone book by their nicknames for identification purposes - Lettuce Leaf, Spuddy, Bubby, Diddles and Loppy to name just a few.  Torres Strait Islands  A Thursday Island Torres Strait dancer.  Image courtesy of State Library of Queensland.  The Torres Strait separates the land masses of Australia and New Guinea. Torres Strait Islanders are of the Melanesian grouping of people and are traditionally mariners. They have a long history of trade with both Aboriginal and New Guinean people.  The islands are named after the Spaniard Luiz Vez de Torres who sailed through in 1606. After Australia was colonised by England, the Torres Strait became a sea route for ships travelling between Australia and Britain. This enabled the islanders to extend their trade partners, but also meant European rule, culture and religion were imposed.  In the 1860s, the discovery of pearl shell and trepang (sea cucumber), a delicacy appreciated by the Chinese, brought people from all over the region to the Torres Strait. By 1877, 16 pearling firms were operating on Thursday Island. The colony of Queensland recognised the value of this resource, and annexed the islands in 1879.  The influx of settlers severely restricted the ability of the islanders to continue their traditional lives and travels. It wasn't until 1936 that islanders took charge of local government. In 1990 they were officially recognised as a distinct people.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works.

Belfast West was the fourth by-election held since the 2010 General Election. There were 6 candidates on the ballot paper.  The by-election was called after the former MP, Gerry Adams, vacated his seat.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).  Current MP: Paul Maskey (Sinn Fein) Born 1969. Belfast councillor 2001-2009. MLA for Belfast West since 2007.  2011 By-election.  Gerry Adams resigned from the Commons on the 26th January 2011 in order to contest the seat of Louth in the Republic of Ireland general election. Adams initially refused to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds or manor of Northstead, instead attempting to resign by writing to the Speaker. He was subsequently appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead. The by-election was held on the 9th June and was a easy hold for Sinn Fein.  By-election candidates:  Paul Maskey (Sinn Fein) Born 1969. Belfast councillor 2001-2009. MLA for Belfast West since 2007.  Alex Attwood (SDLP) Born 1959, Belfast. Educated at Queens University.

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts.  The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region.  The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. While some of the northern outposts of Aragon are inaccessible in winter because of snow, the region is, on the whole, fairly dry, enjoying a humid, Mediterranean-style climate in many areas.  Like most of Spain, Aragon was under the domination of the Moors from the 8th to the 14th centuries. However, many Muslims decided to remain in Aragon after the Christian Re-conquest, resulting in a style of architecture that is unique to Aragon.  Mudejar – meaning “those who are allowed to stay” – is a form of architecture employing bricks, plaster and the repetitive geometric patterns characteristic of early Islamic art. The buildings are finished off with ceramic tiles. The city of Teruel and the town of Calatayud are home to some of the best examples of Mudejar architecture.  Aragon may be best known for the marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla in 1469, which effectively created modern Spain. Their youngest daughter, Katherine of Aragon, became the first queen of Henry VIII of England.  Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in Spain, and funded Christopher Columbus’ expedition to America in 1492. For these accomplishments, they were dubbed “The Catholic Monarchs” by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. Everywhere in Aragon, there are reminders of the long, colorful history of Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign.  Abiding traditions  Aragon is steeped in tradition, and bull fighting and bull running play a major part in Aragonese culture. Most towns and villages hold some sort of bull festival in September; people who have issues with the ethics of bull fighting may be uncomfortable living in a region where the traditional is such an intrinsic part of local culture.  Aragon is also famous for the Jota, an energetic 17th-century dance particular to the region. While the flamenco, which originated in Andalucia, is now performed all over Spain, the Jota remains the proud possession of Aragonese culture. Both men and women perform the Jota, which involves a lot of noise and leaping around.  Moving to Aragon  Aragon has a population of around 1.3 million, of which over 10%, or about 173,000, are foreigners.  These come from all over the world, as there is significant foreign investment in the region. General Motors, Bosch Siemens and Adidas all have major plants in Aragon.  Property prices in Aragon are very competitive. On average, houses in Aragon are 56% cheaper than the national average.  Away from the regional capital of Zaragoza, which houses more than half of the region’s population, Aragon is sparsely populated. There are only two other cities– Teruel and Huesca – in all of Aragon. For those who want to get away from it all, Aragon is the place to do it.

Alexander Hamilton  Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation\'s financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and "The New York Post" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.  They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking. | Question: When was the American patriot Hamilton, New York Wass named after born?', ['January 11, 1755 or 1757July'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-945'), ("Context: `` A Groovy Kind of Love '' is a pop song written by Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager and published by the Screen Gems music publishing company .

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015).

The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds. The name “unmodified round brilliant” was applied to a symmetrical round cut with a regular array of 58 facets, cut to modern standards. The system was the culmination of years of research that included the results of preference testing among a wide variety of groups, including trade professionals and consumers.  GIA designed the system to assess the design quality and craftsmanship of diamonds cut in the standard round brilliant style when compared to modern preferences. | Question: A modern round brilliant cut has 58 what?", ['facets'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3808'), ('Context: All of these examples deal with a lurking variable , which is simply a hidden third variable that affects both causes of the correlation .

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

What is the History of Fleet Street?  charlesdickenspage.com  Main Image:\xa0  Fleet Street is the name of a popular street in London that was once the centre of British Press and Journalism. Up till the 1980s most of the Offices of the British press was housed on Fleet Street. Today many media agencies have moved out of Fleet Street but the Street continues to represent the British Press. The Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. The tube stations nearest to Fleet Street are Chancery Lane, Temple and Blackfriars. There are many streets in London which may surpass the Fleet Street in its architectural design but the Fleet Street is regarded historically as one of London’s important streets.  Content  \xa0  What is the Etymology of Fleet Street?  The name Fleet Street is derived from the name of River Fleet that is now an underground stream. Fleet street once had all the important newspaper offices almost till the 1980.s However by 2005 the last of the British press agencies, the Reuters left Fleet Sreet. The Street is so strongly linked with British Journalists that even now it is used synonymously for the British Press.  \xa0  \xa0  What is the History of Fleet Street?\xa0  The use of the name Fleet Street can be dated back to the 13th century when it was known as Fleet Bridge Street. Around the 14th century the Street came to be known by its present usage. Publishing began in Fleet Street with the setting up of a printing shop by Wynkyn de Worde,apprentice to William Caxton. Around the same time, Richard Pynson set up his publishing and printing office near St. Dunstan’s Church. This was followed by a number of other publishers and printers with The Daily Courant-London;s first daily paper setting up its premises on Fleet Street in March 1702.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  Where is Fleet Street Located?\xa0  The Street named as Fleet Street started from the City of London and extended till WestmininserThe Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. In former times the River Fleet acted like the boundary of the medieval city of London,enforced by walls to ward off any foreign invasions. The construction of the Fleet Street in the city London marked the expansion of London in the early 14th century. While the River Fleet flowed at the East end of the street,the West end is marked by the Temple Bar ,setting the city limits. To the south of the Fleet Street lies The Temple, which is a complex of buildings formerly owned by the Knights Templar.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  What is the Status of the Present Day Fleet Street?  Fleet Street is now associated with law as its inns and chambers are occupied by barristers, mostly located in down alleys from where the former newspaper offices have moved to Wapping and Canary Wharf.The office occupied by “The Daily Telegraph ” has now become the headquarters of Goldman Sachs,an nvestment bank. Another private bank,C.Hoare&Co. has been based on Fleet Street since 1690. However a number of British New agencies such as D.C Thomas & Co, Commonwealth Broadcasting Associatio,\xa0\xa0continue to function from Fleet Street.

Running eastwards from the Strand towards Ludgate Hill and St Paul's , Fleet Street was once synonymous with Britain's national daily and Sunday newspapers.  The association began in 1500 when William Caxton's assistant, Wynkyn de Worde, moved his printing presses from Westminster and set up opposite Shoe Lane.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

Belfast West was the fourth by-election held since the 2010 General Election. There were 6 candidates on the ballot paper.  The by-election was called after the former MP, Gerry Adams, vacated his seat.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).  Current MP: Paul Maskey (Sinn Fein) Born 1969. Belfast councillor 2001-2009. MLA for Belfast West since 2007.  2011 By-election.  Gerry Adams resigned from the Commons on the 26th January 2011 in order to contest the seat of Louth in the Republic of Ireland general election. Adams initially refused to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds or manor of Northstead, instead attempting to resign by writing to the Speaker. He was subsequently appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead. The by-election was held on the 9th June and was a easy hold for Sinn Fein.

Aragon stretches south almost half the length of Spain, and although it’s a landlocked area, it holds a wealth of topographical contrasts.  The Pyrenees dominate the landscape in the north. The highest peaks of the mountain range that separates France and Spain can be found in Aragon, making it an ideal location for skiing in winter. Then there is the lush Ebro Valley, dotted with pretty villages, and the vibrant city of Zaragoza (known as Saragossa by many in the English-speaking world). Zaragoza is Aragon’s capital and the most densely populated city of the region.  The treeless plateaus of central Aragon contrast vividly with the mountain regions and the fertile Ebro Valley. Here you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in the whole of Spain. Everywhere there are castles, although many of them are now, sadly, in ruins. While some of the northern outposts of Aragon are inaccessible in winter because of snow, the region is, on the whole, fairly dry, enjoying a humid, Mediterranean-style climate in many areas.  Like most of Spain, Aragon was under the domination of the Moors from the 8th to the 14th centuries. However, many Muslims decided to remain in Aragon after the Christian Re-conquest, resulting in a style of architecture that is unique to Aragon.  Mudejar – meaning “those who are allowed to stay” – is a form of architecture employing bricks, plaster and the repetitive geometric patterns characteristic of early Islamic art. The buildings are finished off with ceramic tiles. The city of Teruel and the town of Calatayud are home to some of the best examples of Mudejar architecture.  Aragon may be best known for the marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla in 1469, which effectively created modern Spain. Their youngest daughter, Katherine of Aragon, became the first queen of Henry VIII of England.  Ferdinand and Isabella conquered Granada, the last remaining Moorish kingdom in Spain, and funded Christopher Columbus’ expedition to America in 1492. For these accomplishments, they were dubbed “The Catholic Monarchs” by Pope Alexander VI in 1494. Everywhere in Aragon, there are reminders of the long, colorful history of Ferdinand and Isabella’s reign.  Abiding traditions  Aragon is steeped in tradition, and bull fighting and bull running play a major part in Aragonese culture. Most towns and villages hold some sort of bull festival in September; people who have issues with the ethics of bull fighting may be uncomfortable living in a region where the traditional is such an intrinsic part of local culture.  Aragon is also famous for the Jota, an energetic 17th-century dance particular to the region. While the flamenco, which originated in Andalucia, is now performed all over Spain, the Jota remains the proud possession of Aragonese culture. Both men and women perform the Jota, which involves a lot of noise and leaping around.  Moving to Aragon  Aragon has a population of around 1.3 million, of which over 10%, or about 173,000, are foreigners.  These come from all over the world, as there is significant foreign investment in the region. General Motors, Bosch Siemens and Adidas all have major plants in Aragon.  Property prices in Aragon are very competitive. On average, houses in Aragon are 56% cheaper than the national average.  Away from the regional capital of Zaragoza, which houses more than half of the region’s population, Aragon is sparsely populated. There are only two other cities– Teruel and Huesca – in all of Aragon. For those who want to get away from it all, Aragon is the place to do it.

Alexander Hamilton  Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation\'s financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and "The New York Post" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.  They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking. | Question: When was the American patriot Hamilton, New York Wass named after born?', ['January 11, 1755 or 1757July'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-945'), ("Context: `` A Groovy Kind of Love '' is a pop song written by Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager and published by the Screen Gems music publishing company .

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

She was born into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of a firefighter father[5] and homemaker mother. Her younger brother Randy Moffitt grew up to become a professional baseball player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.[6]  [edit] Early career  Moffitt learned to play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.[7] She attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School[8] where she was a member of Zayn Welfare Sorority. She first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women\'s doubles title at Wimbledon in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.[9] At Wimbledon in 1962, in only her second career singles match at that tournament, Moffitt upset the number one player in the world and top seed, Margaret Smith Court, in a second round match after Court had led 5-2 and was serving at 5-3 (30-15) in the third set.[10]  In 1965, Moffitt married law student Lawrence King.  In 1966, King won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon. She followed up in 1967 by winning the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. She developed a reputation as an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher, with excellent speed and a highly competitive personality. King once said, "Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever."[11]  Before the start of the open era in 1968, she earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at Los Angeles State College when not playing in major tennis tournaments.  In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the Association\'s practice of "shamateurism," where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men\'s and women\'s games. As the financial backing of the women\'s game improved due to the efforts of World Tennis magazine founder, publisher and editor Gladys M. Heldman, King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971; however, inequalities continued.  In 1972, King won the U.S. Open but received US$15,000 less than the men\'s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that if the prize money was not equal by the following year, she would not play. In 1973, the U.S. Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.  Despite King\'s achievements at the world\'s biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers King for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.  Riggs had been a top men\'s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks, becoming the world\'s best player in the mid-1940. He then became a self-described tennis "hustler" who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male chauvinist. Claiming that the women\'s game was so inferior to the men\'s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Smith Court 6-2, 6-1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.  Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

What is the History of Fleet Street?  charlesdickenspage.com  Main Image:\xa0  Fleet Street is the name of a popular street in London that was once the centre of British Press and Journalism. Up till the 1980s most of the Offices of the British press was housed on Fleet Street. Today many media agencies have moved out of Fleet Street but the Street continues to represent the British Press. The Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. The tube stations nearest to Fleet Street are Chancery Lane, Temple and Blackfriars. There are many streets in London which may surpass the Fleet Street in its architectural design but the Fleet Street is regarded historically as one of London’s important streets.  Content  \xa0  What is the Etymology of Fleet Street?  The name Fleet Street is derived from the name of River Fleet that is now an underground stream. Fleet street once had all the important newspaper offices almost till the 1980.s However by 2005 the last of the British press agencies, the Reuters left Fleet Sreet. The Street is so strongly linked with British Journalists that even now it is used synonymously for the British Press.  \xa0  \xa0  What is the History of Fleet Street?\xa0  The use of the name Fleet Street can be dated back to the 13th century when it was known as Fleet Bridge Street. Around the 14th century the Street came to be known by its present usage. Publishing began in Fleet Street with the setting up of a printing shop by Wynkyn de Worde,apprentice to William Caxton. Around the same time, Richard Pynson set up his publishing and printing office near St. Dunstan’s Church. This was followed by a number of other publishers and printers with The Daily Courant-London;s first daily paper setting up its premises on Fleet Street in March 1702.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  Where is Fleet Street Located?\xa0  The Street named as Fleet Street started from the City of London and extended till WestmininserThe Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. In former times the River Fleet acted like the boundary of the medieval city of London,enforced by walls to ward off any foreign invasions. The construction of the Fleet Street in the city London marked the expansion of London in the early 14th century. While the River Fleet flowed at the East end of the street,the West end is marked by the Temple Bar ,setting the city limits. To the south of the Fleet Street lies The Temple, which is a complex of buildings formerly owned by the Knights Templar.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  What is the Status of the Present Day Fleet Street?  Fleet Street is now associated with law as its inns and chambers are occupied by barristers, mostly located in down alleys from where the former newspaper offices have moved to Wapping and Canary Wharf.The office occupied by “The Daily Telegraph ” has now become the headquarters of Goldman Sachs,an nvestment bank. Another private bank,C.Hoare&Co. has been based on Fleet Street since 1690. However a number of British New agencies such as D.C Thomas & Co, Commonwealth Broadcasting Associatio,\xa0\xa0continue to function from Fleet Street.

Running eastwards from the Strand towards Ludgate Hill and St Paul's , Fleet Street was once synonymous with Britain's national daily and Sunday newspapers.  The association began in 1500 when William Caxton's assistant, Wynkyn de Worde, moved his printing presses from Westminster and set up opposite Shoe Lane.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: Albertín Aroldis Chapman de la Cruz ( Spanish : ( aˈɾoldis ˈtʃapman ) ; born February 28 , 1988 ) is a Cuban - American professional baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .

The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database. There is no transcript for a trial of a Sweeney Todd, nor for that matter any similar crimes.

Pope's paternal grandfather is supposed to have been Alexander Pope, rector of Thruxton, Hampshire (instituted 1 May 1630–1; information from the Winchester bishop's register, communicated by Mr. J. C. Smith, of Somerset House), who died in 1645. The poet's father, according to his epitaph, was seventy-five at his death, 23 Oct. 1717, and therefore born in 1641 or 1642 (see also P. T.'s letter to Curll in Pope's Works, by Elwin and Courthope, vi. 423, where he is said to have been a posthumous son). According to Warton, he was a merchant at Lisbon, where he was converted to catholicism. He was afterwards a linendraper in Broad Street, London. A first wife, Magdalen, was buried 12 Aug. 1679 (register of St. Benet Fink); he had by her a daughter Magdalen, afterwards Mrs. Rackett; and in the Pangbourne register, Ambrose Staveley, the rector, records the burial of 'Alexander Pope, son of my brother-in law, Alexander Pope, merchant of London,' on 1 Sept. 1682 ( information from Mr. J. C. Smith). Pope's statement in a note in the Epistle to Arbuthnot, that his father belonged to the family of the earls of Downe, appears to have been a fiction (Warton, Essay, ii. 255). The poet's maternal grandfather descended from a family of small landowners in Yorkshire. He had seventeen children, one of whom, Edith, the poet's mother, was baptised on 18 June 1642, though, according to her epitaph, she was ninety-three at her death on 7 June 1733. Christiana, another daughter, married the portrait-painter, Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) [q. v.], and at her death in 1693, left some china, pictures, and medals to her nephew. Three of her sons, according to Pope's statement (Epistle to Arbuthnot), were in the service of Charles I. Alexander Pope, the linendraper, after his second marriage, moved his business to Lombard Street. He made some money by his trade, and in or before 1700 moved to Binfield in Windsor Forest. It appears from his will (Carruthers, Pope, 1857, p. 463) that he had some landed property, and he also invested money in French rentes (Works, vi. 189, 201). The story, first told by Ruffhead, that he put all his money in a strong-box and lived upon the principal, is therefore erroneous. As a catholic, he was exposed to various disqualifications; but he appears to have lived comfortably among the country gentry. He had many friends among the Roman catholics, several of whom lived near the forest. He was fond of gardening, and had twenty acres of land round his house at Binfield. One room of the house is said to remain, and a row of Scottish firs near it was apparently there in Pope's time.  Pope was precocious, and in his infancy healthy. He was called the ‘little nightingale’ from the beauty of his voice, a name still applied to him in later years by the dramatist Southern (Ruffhead, p. 476; Orrery, Swift, p. 207). A portrait, painted when he was ten years old, showed him ‘plump and pretty, and of a fresh complexion.’ This is said to have been like him at the time; but a severe illness two years later, brought on by ‘perpetual application,’ ruined his health and distorted his figure (Spence | Question: What was the first name of the poet Mr. Pope, 1688-1744?", ['alexander'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1860'), ('Context: Lesser Celandine | The Flower Expert - Flowers EncyclopediaLesser Celandine | The Flower Expert - Flowers Encyclopedia  Species  ficaria  Celandine is a common name for two species of flowers: They are Greater Celandine, which belongs to poppy family, and Lesser celandine, belonging to Ranunculus family. Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.

Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Monet began the paintings in January or early February 1892. He visited Rouen on three occasions and completed 20 views of Rouen Cathedral between March 1892 and Feb-April 1893.  Monet in the \'90s: the Series Paintings  Average Customer Review: 4.7 out of 5 stars See all reviews (3 customer reviews)  This is an important and critically acclaimed book for all those wanting to study Monet and his series paintings.  Paul Hayes Tucker is the leading expert on Monet in the USA. This book locates the series paintings within the context of their time. Tucker looks at the development of his art before the 1890s and the cultural pressures of the 1880s that caused Monet to turn to serial painting.  He focuses on the major and minor series of paintings from the 1890s - including the paintings of Rouen Cathedral - and examines how they were painted and how they were received.  “To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor. What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me."  — Claude Monet  About Rouen Cathedral  Rouen Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral in Rouen, in northwestern France.  It\'s the seat of the Archbishop of Rouen and the building of Notre dame Cathedral started in 1200 and contains nearly the entire history of the Gothic style over a period of some 400 years. In the middle ages it\'s also where the kings of France were crowned.  Rouen is also situated some 60 kilometres from Giverny and is a city which Monet - and the French - knew well.  When looked at from the perspective of his paintings prior to 1892, the important thing to note is that he had never before before focused on one building or architectural element or even painted one motif as often as he did with Rouen Cathedral and its facades.  It\'s maybe important to note that Turner - the other great painter of atmosphere and light - had also created an engraving of Rouen Cathedral as part of his series on River Scenery in France.  The novelty of working with one motif meant that it became imbued with meaning. Hayes Tucker points to the religious revival in France in the 1890s and the fact that a Gothic Cathedral was a distinctly French symbol.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

"It\'s the deadliest thing in the sea," according to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in Washington. "Victims usually experience shock, muscular cramps, numbness, nausea, vomiting, severe backache, frothing at the mouth, constriction of the throat, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, paralysis, delirium, convulsion and, finally, death."  Dozens of people are killed each year by these transparent, grapefruit-size predators. So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  "Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks," said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. "That\'s because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim\'s susceptibility to the creature\'s venom."  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp\'s venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra\'s, only deadlier.  "Even a mild brush can cause intense pain," writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. "The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time."  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp\'s long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  "Stay out of those waters at all costs," advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World\'s Most Dangerous Creatures. "Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don\'t actually come after humans to attack."

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

10/01/2021 12:01:46 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: Volkswagen BeetleThe Volkswagen Beetle (officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in Germany the Volkswagen Käfer and in the U.S. as Volkswagen Bug) is a two-door, four passenger, rear-engine economy car manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003.  The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").   In May 1934, at a meeting at Berlin’s Kaiserhof Hotel, Chancellor Hitler insisted on a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at  while not using more than 7 litres of fuel per 100\xa0km (32 mpg US/39 mpg UK). The engine had to be powerful for sustained cruising on Germany’s new Autobahnen.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: Albertín Aroldis Chapman de la Cruz ( Spanish : ( aˈɾoldis ˈtʃapman ) ; born February 28 , 1988 ) is a Cuban - American professional baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .

Discovering the Biblical Moses  Read Peter Machinist’s article “The Man Moses” as it originally appeared in Bible Review, April 2000. The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

Pope's paternal grandfather is supposed to have been Alexander Pope, rector of Thruxton, Hampshire (instituted 1 May 1630–1; information from the Winchester bishop's register, communicated by Mr. J. C. Smith, of Somerset House), who died in 1645. The poet's father, according to his epitaph, was seventy-five at his death, 23 Oct. 1717, and therefore born in 1641 or 1642 (see also P. T.'s letter to Curll in Pope's Works, by Elwin and Courthope, vi. 423, where he is said to have been a posthumous son). According to Warton, he was a merchant at Lisbon, where he was converted to catholicism. He was afterwards a linendraper in Broad Street, London. A first wife, Magdalen, was buried 12 Aug. 1679 (register of St. Benet Fink); he had by her a daughter Magdalen, afterwards Mrs. Rackett; and in the Pangbourne register, Ambrose Staveley, the rector, records the burial of 'Alexander Pope, son of my brother-in law, Alexander Pope, merchant of London,' on 1 Sept. 1682 ( information from Mr. J. C. Smith). Pope's statement in a note in the Epistle to Arbuthnot, that his father belonged to the family of the earls of Downe, appears to have been a fiction (Warton, Essay, ii. 255). The poet's maternal grandfather descended from a family of small landowners in Yorkshire. He had seventeen children, one of whom, Edith, the poet's mother, was baptised on 18 June 1642, though, according to her epitaph, she was ninety-three at her death on 7 June 1733. Christiana, another daughter, married the portrait-painter, Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) [q. v.], and at her death in 1693, left some china, pictures, and medals to her nephew. Three of her sons, according to Pope's statement (Epistle to Arbuthnot), were in the service of Charles I. Alexander Pope, the linendraper, after his second marriage, moved his business to Lombard Street. He made some money by his trade, and in or before 1700 moved to Binfield in Windsor Forest. It appears from his will (Carruthers, Pope, 1857, p. 463) that he had some landed property, and he also invested money in French rentes (Works, vi. 189, 201). The story, first told by Ruffhead, that he put all his money in a strong-box and lived upon the principal, is therefore erroneous. As a catholic, he was exposed to various disqualifications; but he appears to have lived comfortably among the country gentry. He had many friends among the Roman catholics, several of whom lived near the forest. He was fond of gardening, and had twenty acres of land round his house at Binfield. One room of the house is said to remain, and a row of Scottish firs near it was apparently there in Pope's time.  Pope was precocious, and in his infancy healthy. He was called the ‘little nightingale’ from the beauty of his voice, a name still applied to him in later years by the dramatist Southern (Ruffhead, p. 476; Orrery, Swift, p. 207). A portrait, painted when he was ten years old, showed him ‘plump and pretty, and of a fresh complexion.’ This is said to have been like him at the time; but a severe illness two years later, brought on by ‘perpetual application,’ ruined his health and distorted his figure (Spence | Question: What was the first name of the poet Mr. Pope, 1688-1744?", ['alexander'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1860'), ('Context: Lesser Celandine | The Flower Expert - Flowers EncyclopediaLesser Celandine | The Flower Expert - Flowers Encyclopedia  Species  ficaria  Celandine is a common name for two species of flowers: They are Greater Celandine, which belongs to poppy family, and Lesser celandine, belonging to Ranunculus family. Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Monet in the \'90s: the Series Paintings  Average Customer Review: 4.7 out of 5 stars See all reviews (3 customer reviews)  This is an important and critically acclaimed book for all those wanting to study Monet and his series paintings.  Paul Hayes Tucker is the leading expert on Monet in the USA. This book locates the series paintings within the context of their time. Tucker looks at the development of his art before the 1890s and the cultural pressures of the 1880s that caused Monet to turn to serial painting.  He focuses on the major and minor series of paintings from the 1890s - including the paintings of Rouen Cathedral - and examines how they were painted and how they were received.  “To me the motif itself is an insignificant factor. What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me."  — Claude Monet  About Rouen Cathedral  Rouen Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral in Rouen, in northwestern France.  It\'s the seat of the Archbishop of Rouen and the building of Notre dame Cathedral started in 1200 and contains nearly the entire history of the Gothic style over a period of some 400 years. In the middle ages it\'s also where the kings of France were crowned.  Rouen is also situated some 60 kilometres from Giverny and is a city which Monet - and the French - knew well.  When looked at from the perspective of his paintings prior to 1892, the important thing to note is that he had never before before focused on one building or architectural element or even painted one motif as often as he did with Rouen Cathedral and its facades.  It\'s maybe important to note that Turner - the other great painter of atmosphere and light - had also created an engraving of Rouen Cathedral as part of his series on River Scenery in France.  The novelty of working with one motif meant that it became imbued with meaning. Hayes Tucker points to the religious revival in France in the 1890s and the fact that a Gothic Cathedral was a distinctly French symbol.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

"It\'s the deadliest thing in the sea," according to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in Washington. "Victims usually experience shock, muscular cramps, numbness, nausea, vomiting, severe backache, frothing at the mouth, constriction of the throat, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, paralysis, delirium, convulsion and, finally, death."  Dozens of people are killed each year by these transparent, grapefruit-size predators. So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  "Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks," said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. "That\'s because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim\'s susceptibility to the creature\'s venom."  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp\'s venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra\'s, only deadlier.  "Even a mild brush can cause intense pain," writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. "The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time."  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp\'s long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  "Stay out of those waters at all costs," advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World\'s Most Dangerous Creatures. "Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don\'t actually come after humans to attack."

The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  Potassium  The name is derived from the english word potash. The chemical symbol K comes from kalium, the Mediaeval Latin for potash, which may have derived from the arabic word qali, meaning alkali.  Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart. Potassium is silvery when first cut but it oxidizes rapidly in air and tarnishes within minutes, so it is generally stored under oil or grease. It is light enough to float into water with which it reacts instantly to release hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame.  The chemistry of potassium is almost etirely that of the potassium ion, K+.  Applications  Most potassium (95 %) goes into fertilizers and the rest goes mainly into making potassium hydroxide (KOH), by the electrolysis of potassium chloride solution, and then converting this to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Potassium carbonate goes into glass manufacture, expecially the glass used to make televisions, while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soaps and detergents. A little potassium chloride goes into pharmaceuticals, medical drips and saline injections.  Other potassium salts are used in baking, photography and tanning leather, and to make iodize salts. In all cases it is the negative anion, not the potassium, which is the key to their use.  Potassium in the environment  Most potassium occurs in the Earth\'s crust as minerals, such as feldspars and clays. Potassium is leached from these by weathering, which explains why there is quite a lot of this element in the sea (0.75 g/liter).  Minerals mined for their potassium are pinkish and sylvite, carnallite and alunite. The main mining area used to be Germany, which had a monopoly of potassium before the first World War. Today most potassium minerals come from Canada, USA and Chile. The world production of potassim ores is about 50 million tonnes, and reserves are vast (more than 10 billion tonnes).  Potassium is a key plant element. Although it is soluble in water, little is lost from undisturbed soils because as it is released from dead plants and animal excrements, it quickly become strongly bound to clay particles, and it is retained ready to be readsorbed by the roots of other plants.  Health effects of potassium  Potassium can be found in vegetables, fruit, potatoes, meat, bread, milk and nuts. It plays an important role in the physical fluid system of humans and it assists nerve functions. Potassium, as the ion K+, concnetrate inside cells, and 95% of the body\'s potassium is so located. When our kidneys are somehow malfunctioning an accumulation of potassium will consist. This can lead to disturbing heartbeats.  Potassium can effect you when breathed in. Inhalation of dust or mists can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, lungs with sneezing, coughing and sore throat. Higher exposures may cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, this can cause death. Skin and eye contact can cause severe burns leading to permanent damage.

He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...

Mortimer wrote each and every episode of the television series, and their subsequent novelizations. The show ran, off and on, for seventeen years, an incredible run, and inspired not just the short stories, but novels and two radio series.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb. Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films. A few years later, this kind of thing would be done better with WHERE EAGLES DARE. It's kind of hard to accept Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris as Norwegians, not surprisingly the Swedish Ulla Jacobsson (Bergman's SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT) is more convincing.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.

The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris.

The tales are told in rusticated English of the Irish peasantry who had established roots in The Pale, the anglicized part of Ireland.  He is "widely credited with preserving irish idioms in the turn of phrase, sentence structure, Irish words".   Leinster  Leinster ( — — ] ) is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the east of Ireland.  It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster.  Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster.  The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes.  In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. | Question: Patrick Kennedy is known for his collections of Irish  folktales from a province situated in which part of Ireland ?', ['the east of Ireland'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-220'), ('Context: Chemical Elements.com - Potassium (K)Chemical Elements.com - Potassium (K)  Contains an "Introduction to Tungsten", among other things  If you know of any other links for Potassium, please let me know  Bentor, Yinon.

Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Potassium (K) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  Potassium  The name is derived from the english word potash. The chemical symbol K comes from kalium, the Mediaeval Latin for potash, which may have derived from the arabic word qali, meaning alkali.  Potassium is a soft, silvery-white metal, member of the alkali group of the periodic chart. Potassium is silvery when first cut but it oxidizes rapidly in air and tarnishes within minutes, so it is generally stored under oil or grease. It is light enough to float into water with which it reacts instantly to release hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame.  The chemistry of potassium is almost etirely that of the potassium ion, K+.  Applications  Most potassium (95 %) goes into fertilizers and the rest goes mainly into making potassium hydroxide (KOH), by the electrolysis of potassium chloride solution, and then converting this to potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Potassium carbonate goes into glass manufacture, expecially the glass used to make televisions, while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soaps and detergents. A little potassium chloride goes into pharmaceuticals, medical drips and saline injections.  Other potassium salts are used in baking, photography and tanning leather, and to make iodize salts. In all cases it is the negative anion, not the potassium, which is the key to their use.  Potassium in the environment  Most potassium occurs in the Earth\'s crust as minerals, such as feldspars and clays. Potassium is leached from these by weathering, which explains why there is quite a lot of this element in the sea (0.75 g/liter).  Minerals mined for their potassium are pinkish and sylvite, carnallite and alunite. The main mining area used to be Germany, which had a monopoly of potassium before the first World War. Today most potassium minerals come from Canada, USA and Chile. The world production of potassim ores is about 50 million tonnes, and reserves are vast (more than 10 billion tonnes).  Potassium is a key plant element. Although it is soluble in water, little is lost from undisturbed soils because as it is released from dead plants and animal excrements, it quickly become strongly bound to clay particles, and it is retained ready to be readsorbed by the roots of other plants.  Health effects of potassium  Potassium can be found in vegetables, fruit, potatoes, meat, bread, milk and nuts. It plays an important role in the physical fluid system of humans and it assists nerve functions. Potassium, as the ion K+, concnetrate inside cells, and 95% of the body\'s potassium is so located. When our kidneys are somehow malfunctioning an accumulation of potassium will consist. This can lead to disturbing heartbeats.  Potassium can effect you when breathed in. Inhalation of dust or mists can irritate the eyes, nose, throat, lungs with sneezing, coughing and sore throat. Higher exposures may cause a build up of fluid in the lungs, this can cause death. Skin and eye contact can cause severe burns leading to permanent damage.

The 500 - year - old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict , during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC . Civil wars and executions continued , culminating in the victory of Octavian , Caesar 's adopted son , over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt . Octavian 's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus , effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic . | Question: where is roman empire located on a map ?", ['around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe , Africa and Asia'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-24537'), ('Context: Whereas the Gospel of John was written to unbelievers , this epistle was written to those who were already believers ( 5 : 13 ) .

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies. Skylab was 30.2 metres (99 feet) in length and 6.7 metres (22 feet) in diameter and had a mass of about 75,000 kg (165,000 pounds). Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research. Its main scientific instrument, the Apollo Telescope Mount , incorporated a number of component telescopes and other devices for observing the Sun over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum , from visible light through X-rays .

During Skylab’s ascent a thermal meteoroid shield was ripped off, which led to the loss of one of the lateral solar power arrays that was to supply electricity to the station and prevented full extension of the other. The first three-man crew deployed an improvised “parasol” sunshade (later fortified with an overlying sun shield) to prevent serious overheating of the station during their 28-day mission and released the jammed solar array. Skylab hosted two additional three-man crews for missions lasting 59 and 84 days. Each of the three Skylab missions set a new space endurance record. Although plans called for Skylab to be used again with one of the first space shuttle missions boosting it to a higher orbit, increased solar activity caused its orbit to degrade faster than expected.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring.

The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies.

As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously. Three women were awarded the GC for resistance activities in occupied  territories during WW 2. One of them was Noor Inayat Khan.

Discovering the Biblical Moses  Read Peter Machinist’s article “The Man Moses” as it originally appeared in Bible Review, April 2000. The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

A yellowish or reddish latex will ooze from broken stems, containing several noxious substances. The latex was used to treat warts; the alkaloids it contains are virucidal. Extracts from the plant have, in the past, been used in medicine for a panoply of conditions, including jaundice, hepatitis, ringworm, eczema and eye conditions.  Greater Celandine possesses a number of alkaloids belonging to the protopine group, namely Chelerythrine, Chelidonine, Sanguinarine, Berberine and Coptisine, all depicted below. Barberry contains a number of other protopine alkaloids, including Berberine.  ISOQUINOLINE ALKALOIDS  All parts of the plant are highly poisonous including the latex. Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs. Most cleaning attempts merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

The 2012 Summer Olympics included 26 sports, with two additional sports due to be added to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports.  The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF).  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of Aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation),  or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of Skating, represented by the International Skating Union).  In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport\'s prevalence. The IOC\'s requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well—more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and Summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).  Previous Olympic Games included sports which are no longer present on the current program, like polo and tug of war.  These sports, known as "discontinued sports", were later removed either because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body. Archery and tennis are examples of sports that were competed at the early Games and were later dropped by the IOC, but managed to return to the Olympic program (in 1972 and 1988, respectively). Demonstration sports have often been included in the Olympic Games, usually to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport.  Some such sports, like baseball and curling, were added to the official Olympic program (in 1992 and 1998, respectively). Baseball, however, was discontinued after the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Olympic sports definitions  The term "sport" in Olympic terminology refers to all the events that are sanctioned by one international sport federation, a definition that may be different from the common meaning of the word sport. One sport, by Olympic definition, may be divided into several disciplines, which are often regarded as separate sports in common language.  For example: Aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines: Swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and high diving (the last of which is a non-Olympic discipline), since all these disciplines are governed at international level by the International Swimming Federation. Skating is a winter Olympic sport represented by the International Skating Union, and includes four disciplines: figure skating, speed skating (on a traditional long track), short track speed skating and synchronized skating (the latter is a non-Olympic discipline). The sport with the largest number of Olympic disciplines is skiing, with six: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, nordic combined, snowboarding and freestyle skiing.  Other notable multi-discipline sports are gymnastics (artistic, rhythmic and trampoline), cycling (road, track, mountain and BMX), volleyball (indoors and beach), wrestling (freestyle and Greco-Roman), canoeing (flatwater and slalom) and bobsleigh (includes skeleton). The disciplines listed here are only those contested in the Olympics—gymnastics has two non-Olympic disciplines, while cycling and wrestling have three each.  It should also be noted that the IOC definition of a "discipline" may differ from that used by an international federation. For example, the IOC considers artistic gymnastics a single discipline, but the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG) classifies men\'s and women\'s artistic gymnastics as separate disciplines.  Similarly, the IOC considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline, but United World Wrestling uses "freestyle wrestling | Question: Summer Olympic sports are divided into categories based on popularity and the potential in generating revenue.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs. Most cleaning attempts merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

The 2012 Summer Olympics included 26 sports, with two additional sports due to be added to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports.  The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF).  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of Aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation),  or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of Skating, represented by the International Skating Union).  In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport\'s prevalence. The IOC\'s requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well—more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and Summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).  Previous Olympic Games included sports which are no longer present on the current program, like polo and tug of war.  These sports, known as "discontinued sports", were later removed either because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body. Archery and tennis are examples of sports that were competed at the early Games and were later dropped by the IOC, but managed to return to the Olympic program (in 1972 and 1988, respectively). Demonstration sports have often been included in the Olympic Games, usually to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport.  Some such sports, like baseball and curling, were added to the official Olympic program (in 1992 and 1998, respectively). Baseball, however, was discontinued after the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Olympic sports definitions  The term "sport" in Olympic terminology refers to all the events that are sanctioned by one international sport federation, a definition that may be different from the common meaning of the word sport. One sport, by Olympic definition, may be divided into several disciplines, which are often regarded as separate sports in common language.  For example: Aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines: Swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and high diving (the last of which is a non-Olympic discipline), since all these disciplines are governed at international level by the International Swimming Federation. Skating is a winter Olympic sport represented by the International Skating Union, and includes four disciplines: figure skating, speed skating (on a traditional long track), short track speed skating and synchronized skating (the latter is a non-Olympic discipline). The sport with the largest number of Olympic disciplines is skiing, with six: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, nordic combined, snowboarding and freestyle skiing.  Other notable multi-discipline sports are gymnastics (artistic, rhythmic and trampoline), cycling (road, track, mountain and BMX), volleyball (indoors and beach), wrestling (freestyle and Greco-Roman), canoeing (flatwater and slalom) and bobsleigh (includes skeleton). The disciplines listed here are only those contested in the Olympics—gymnastics has two non-Olympic disciplines, while cycling and wrestling have three each.  It should also be noted that the IOC definition of a "discipline" may differ from that used by an international federation. For example, the IOC considers artistic gymnastics a single discipline, but the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG) classifies men\'s and women\'s artistic gymnastics as separate disciplines.  Similarly, the IOC considers freestyle wrestling to be a single discipline, but United World Wrestling uses "freestyle wrestling | Question: Summer Olympic sports are divided into categories based on popularity and the potential in generating revenue.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)

Celandines are seen as a thick carpet of gold where they are abundant.  The Celandine flowers have eight glossy, butter-yellow petals, arranged in a rosette form and are seen singly on delicate stalks rising above the leaves. The outer petals are 8-10 and inner petals are paired. And the centre of the flower has tiny flowers, which are very inconspicous. The Celandine flowers bloom in March and April.  Facts About Celandine  Celandine Plant grows 2-6 inches in height.  Celandine plant is shiny, with lustrous dark green leaves that form a rosette.  Celandine leaves are kidney to heart shaped with smooth to coarse toothed edges.  Celandine leaves and flowers arise on separate stems.  The blossoms close before rain, and even in fine weather do not open before 9 a.m., and by 5 p.m. they are closed for the night.  Celandine flowers are sometimes refered as spring messenger.  The Celandine flowers are yellow, turning white as they age, and in shady places the leaves develop bulbils at the base of the stalk.  from our stores - Pickupflowers - the flower expert  Growing Lesser Celandines  The celandine has several devices for propagation. Celandine flowers ripen into seed heads, but fertilization is poor. Since celandines are perennials they die back each year. The roots, bulbs, and tubers live and grow under the soil. These tubers store all the required energy for the plant through winter. When the spring comes, these tubers give out new leaves and flowers. Thus the celandine flowering plant spreads.  Caring for Lesser Celandine  Any Water soluble fertilizers should be used every two weeks during the growing season.  The plant should be provided full sunlight to grow to their full potential.  The plant should be watered regularly.  Protect the plants from spider-mites and other mites by using required pesticides.

Greater Celandine contains the poisons isoquinoline alkaloids chelidonine, chelerythrine, sanguinarine, coptisine and berberine and other benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids.  Chelidonine inhibits mitosis and is cytotoxic. Ingestion of the plant results in a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, followed by nausea, vomiting, sedation, narcosis, low pulse rate and finally cardiac arrest.  Sanguinarine is also found in Opium Poppy . If ingested, dropsy may result. On contact with skin Sanguarine will kill cells leaving a bleeding wound and a huge black scab of necrotic tissue similar to acid or alkali burns. Greater Celandine has been used commercially in wart removal preparations.  Sanguinarine is used in some tooth-pastes and mouth rinses for its anti-plaque activity, but is no longer considered safe for prolonged use.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They\'ve threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn\'t a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like "real" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge).

In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs.

Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai).

It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything."

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They\'ve threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn\'t a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like "real" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.  The cybermen had cameo appearances in a number of episodes, but they made major appearances in the following:  Tue Feb 25 2003 at 14:15:41  \'Imagine that you can live forever and life is totally free from pain.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge).

His brother travelled from Parkhurst Prison in the Isle of Wight where he is still held as a maximum security Category "A" prisoner.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

This is a video from AnswersinGenesis correcting a lot of the common misconceptions about the famous Scopes Monkey Trial.  Check out GreenSlugg.com for more Creation vs. Evolution information.  Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett. For the reader dedicated to collectible Ian Fleming books, there are many first edition James Bond books in various printings, conditions and price points to suit every collector\'s desires.

A:  Quick Answer  The last Winter Olympic Games were held in Sochi, Russia. The XXII Olympic Winter Games were declared open on February 7, 2014, and the closing ceremony was held on February 23, 2014.  Full Answer  In 2007, the International Olympic Committee voted from a short list of three cities to determine the host city for the 2014 Games. Sochi won the vote by a small margin. After hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Vancouver, Canada, passed the Olympic flame to Sochi for the opening of the 2014 Winter Games. The next Winter Olympics are scheduled to take place in PyeongChang in the Republic of Korea in 2018.  2010 Winter OlympicsThe 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XXIes Jeux olympiques d\'hiver) and commonly known as Vancouver 2010, informally the 21st Winter Olympics, were a major international multi-sport event held from February 12 to 28, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands, and in the resort town of Whistler. Approximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC), headed by John Furlong. The 2010 Winter Olympics were the third Olympics hosted by Canada and the first by the province of British Columbia. Previously, Canada hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta.  Following Olympic tradition, then-Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan received the Olympic flag during the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The flag was raised on February 28, 2006, in a special ceremony and was on display at Vancouver City Hall until the Olympic opening ceremony. The event was officially opened by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, who was accompanied by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge.   For the first time, Canada won gold in an "official" sport at an Olympic Games hosted at home, having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary (although Canada won a gold medal in the demonstration sport of curling in Calgary). Canada clinched their first gold medal on the second day of the competition and first topped the gold medal tally on the second to last day of competition and went on to become the first host nation since Norway in 1952 to lead the gold medal count.  With 14, Canada broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics, which was 13, set by the former Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002. The United States won the most medals in total, their second time doing so at the Winter Olympics, and broke the record for the most medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 37, a record held up to then by Germany in 2002 with 36 medals. Athletes from Slovakia  and Belarus  won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations.  Bid and preparations  The Canadian Olympic Association chose Vancouver as the Canadian candidate city over Calgary, which sought to re-host the Games and Quebec City, which had lost the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995. On the first round of voting on November 21, 1998, Vancouver-Whistler had 26 votes, Quebec City had 25 and Calgary had 21. On December 3, 1998, the second and final round of voting occurred between the two leading contenders, which saw Vancouver win with 40 votes compared to Quebec City\'s 32 votes. Vancouver had also previously bid for the  1976 and  1980 games.  After the bribery scandal over the candidacy of the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics (which resulted in Quebec City asking for compensation (C$8 million) for its unsuccessful bid),  many of the rules of the bidding process were changed in 1999.

Strictly Come Dancing singer Hayley Sanderson, originally from Peterborough, has come a long way since her early days in the cast of many productions at Peterborough\'s Key Youth Theatre.She took time out from the hit dance show\'s national tour to speak to Ann Molyneux-Jackson.  AT the age of 12 when most girls are spending their pocket money on clothes and make-up, Hayley Sanderson splashed out on a PA system to further her singing career.  Even at such a tender age, she was determined to make her fortune from entertaining, and was already out performing at gigs with her uncle who was a musician.  It may have taken years of hard graft, but finally Hayley has made it, and is now a familiar voice to the millions of viewers who tune in to watch Strictly Come Dancing on a Saturday night as one of the four resident singers with the Dave Arch Orchestra.  The 27-year-old, who grew up in Peterborough and is a former pupil of Walton Comprehensive School, joined the BBC1 show, presented by Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, for series five three years ago, having previously worked with musical impressario Arch on the song Something In The Air for a Talk Talk commercial.  This was so successful that a single was released with the proceeds going to Treehouse, a charity for children with autism.  "I did a couple of adverts for Dave Arch including Something In The Air, which he arranged the strings on, then one of the singers pulled out of Strictly and he said, \'would you like the job?\'" Hayley said.  "It\'s the best seat in the house.  "We have a perfect view of the judges and we can see the dancers before they go on.  "Like everyone, I like to see what they are wearing. I absolutely love the outfits.  "But my favourite moments were seeing Shirley Bassey and Beyonce performing."  Appearing on a TV programme with so many viewers is bound to be a daunting prospect.  "This year more than the first two years I have been really nervous," said Hayley, who now lives near Chiswick, in London.  "I never saw the show before I started doing it but now I know how many people watch it.  "I can\'t see the seven million viewers, so that\'s not so bad. All we see is a small audience, so it\'s just like doing a gig, but we can\'t make mistakes because it could spoil the dance routine, so that adds a bit more pressure."  She added: "I don\'t get to see the dancers when I\'m singing so I watch them back when I get home and fast forward when I see myself."  Hayley and the other Strictly singers don\'t get to choose the songs that they are going to perform. That decision is made by the professional dancers.  "I prefer jazz standards and perhaps a nice old Temptations song," she said.  "Some pop numbers are difficult to recreate vocally, and Queen numbers can be quite scary.  "Then if I have to do an \'80s rock ballad, I have to scream and go for it which is quite a challenge."  Surprisingly, the first time the orchestra get together to rehearse is at 10am on the morning of the live television show.  "It\'s a very long day and it takes it out of you and the dancers," said Hayley.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously. Three women were awarded the GC for resistance activities in occupied  territories during WW 2. One of them was Noor Inayat Khan.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

Also check out this link:  Monkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.comMonkey Trial begins - Jul 10, 1925 - HISTORY.com  Monkey Trial begins  Publisher  A+E Networks  In Dayton, Tennessee, the so-called “Monkey Trial” begins with John Thomas Scopes, a young high school science teacher, accused of teaching evolution in violation of a Tennessee state law.  The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett. For the reader dedicated to collectible Ian Fleming books, there are many first edition James Bond books in various printings, conditions and price points to suit every collector\'s desires.

A:  Quick Answer  The last Winter Olympic Games were held in Sochi, Russia. The XXII Olympic Winter Games were declared open on February 7, 2014, and the closing ceremony was held on February 23, 2014.  Full Answer  In 2007, the International Olympic Committee voted from a short list of three cities to determine the host city for the 2014 Games. Sochi won the vote by a small margin. After hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Vancouver, Canada, passed the Olympic flame to Sochi for the opening of the 2014 Winter Games. The next Winter Olympics are scheduled to take place in PyeongChang in the Republic of Korea in 2018.  2010 Winter OlympicsThe 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XXIes Jeux olympiques d\'hiver) and commonly known as Vancouver 2010, informally the 21st Winter Olympics, were a major international multi-sport event held from February 12 to 28, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands, and in the resort town of Whistler. Approximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC), headed by John Furlong. The 2010 Winter Olympics were the third Olympics hosted by Canada and the first by the province of British Columbia. Previously, Canada hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta.  Following Olympic tradition, then-Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan received the Olympic flag during the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The flag was raised on February 28, 2006, in a special ceremony and was on display at Vancouver City Hall until the Olympic opening ceremony. The event was officially opened by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, who was accompanied by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge.   For the first time, Canada won gold in an "official" sport at an Olympic Games hosted at home, having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary (although Canada won a gold medal in the demonstration sport of curling in Calgary). Canada clinched their first gold medal on the second day of the competition and first topped the gold medal tally on the second to last day of competition and went on to become the first host nation since Norway in 1952 to lead the gold medal count.  With 14, Canada broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics, which was 13, set by the former Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002. The United States won the most medals in total, their second time doing so at the Winter Olympics, and broke the record for the most medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 37, a record held up to then by Germany in 2002 with 36 medals. Athletes from Slovakia  and Belarus  won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations.  Bid and preparations  The Canadian Olympic Association chose Vancouver as the Canadian candidate city over Calgary, which sought to re-host the Games and Quebec City, which had lost the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995. On the first round of voting on November 21, 1998, Vancouver-Whistler had 26 votes, Quebec City had 25 and Calgary had 21. On December 3, 1998, the second and final round of voting occurred between the two leading contenders, which saw Vancouver win with 40 votes compared to Quebec City\'s 32 votes. Vancouver had also previously bid for the  1976 and  1980 games.  After the bribery scandal over the candidacy of the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics (which resulted in Quebec City asking for compensation (C$8 million) for its unsuccessful bid),  many of the rules of the bidding process were changed in 1999.

Strictly Come Dancing singer Hayley Sanderson, originally from Peterborough, has come a long way since her early days in the cast of many productions at Peterborough\'s Key Youth Theatre.She took time out from the hit dance show\'s national tour to speak to Ann Molyneux-Jackson.  AT the age of 12 when most girls are spending their pocket money on clothes and make-up, Hayley Sanderson splashed out on a PA system to further her singing career.  Even at such a tender age, she was determined to make her fortune from entertaining, and was already out performing at gigs with her uncle who was a musician.  It may have taken years of hard graft, but finally Hayley has made it, and is now a familiar voice to the millions of viewers who tune in to watch Strictly Come Dancing on a Saturday night as one of the four resident singers with the Dave Arch Orchestra.  The 27-year-old, who grew up in Peterborough and is a former pupil of Walton Comprehensive School, joined the BBC1 show, presented by Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, for series five three years ago, having previously worked with musical impressario Arch on the song Something In The Air for a Talk Talk commercial.  This was so successful that a single was released with the proceeds going to Treehouse, a charity for children with autism.  "I did a couple of adverts for Dave Arch including Something In The Air, which he arranged the strings on, then one of the singers pulled out of Strictly and he said, \'would you like the job?\'" Hayley said.  "It\'s the best seat in the house.  "We have a perfect view of the judges and we can see the dancers before they go on.  "Like everyone, I like to see what they are wearing. I absolutely love the outfits.  "But my favourite moments were seeing Shirley Bassey and Beyonce performing."  Appearing on a TV programme with so many viewers is bound to be a daunting prospect.  "This year more than the first two years I have been really nervous," said Hayley, who now lives near Chiswick, in London.  "I never saw the show before I started doing it but now I know how many people watch it.  "I can\'t see the seven million viewers, so that\'s not so bad. All we see is a small audience, so it\'s just like doing a gig, but we can\'t make mistakes because it could spoil the dance routine, so that adds a bit more pressure."  She added: "I don\'t get to see the dancers when I\'m singing so I watch them back when I get home and fast forward when I see myself."  Hayley and the other Strictly singers don\'t get to choose the songs that they are going to perform. That decision is made by the professional dancers.  "I prefer jazz standards and perhaps a nice old Temptations song," she said.  "Some pop numbers are difficult to recreate vocally, and Queen numbers can be quite scary.  "Then if I have to do an \'80s rock ballad, I have to scream and go for it which is quite a challenge."  Surprisingly, the first time the orchestra get together to rehearse is at 10am on the morning of the live television show.  "It\'s a very long day and it takes it out of you and the dancers," said Hayley.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.  The George Cross was conferred upon the Island of Malta for the display of bravery of its citizens during the war. Four times a George Cross was conferred upon a woman, three of which posthumously.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

We caught a few glimpses of the result early in Kill Bill Vol. 1 with the wreckage left behind when Bill and the Vipers assaulted a tiny rural chapel and slaughtered everyone in sight. Vol. 2 gives us, for the first time, a full account of the wedding rehearsal massacre that sets the plot of this two-part epic in motion. After fending off attacks from Bill’s trailer-trash kid brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and her chief rival within the Squad, Daryl Hannah’s Elle Driver, The Bride tracks her ultimate quarry to his lair in Mexico.  It might be a slight exaggeration to describe Kill Bill Vol. 2 as a “relationship movie.” But it may look like one, at times, in comparison with the wall-to-wall Asian swordplay action of Vol. 1 . Both films are still, as Carradine says, “kung-fu samurai Spaghetti Western love stories.” But as the actor noted in a recent published interview: “ The second one has got a lot more of what you’re used to from Quentin; the quirky character stuff, the surprises, the funny stuff.”  In Kill Bill Vol. 1 , actor David Carradine was almost entirely a sinister presence behind the scenes, a familiar, seductive, baritone voice murmuring on the soundtrack\xad—despite the fact that he played the movie’s title role. But along with Uma Thurman, who continues to cut a wide swath as the revenge-driven Bride, “David dominates Vol. 2 ,” according to writer-director Quentin Tarantino.  When I tell people the name of the movie is Kill Bill ,” Carradine says, “and that I’m Bill, they ask me: ‘Well, what are you, the bad guy?’ And I have to tell ’em, ‘There are no good guys in a Quentin Tarantino movie. It’s all about the bad guys.’ The essence of a Tarantino movie is an inside look at the minds and hearts of violent people. That’s what we go to see his movies for. It’s climbing inside these people’s psyches and showing what makes them tick. There’s a nobility about Bill, yet you also know he’s one of the most evil people you’ve ever met in your life. “Bill is more fun than anything,” Carradine recently told The Associated Press. “Bill has virtually no human problems. He’s just kind of put himself above it all.”  In Vol. 1 we learned that Bill, a broker of killers for hire, had assembled and trained a ruthless assortment of assassins, the so-called Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS). Each of these gifted murderers was code-named for a different species of poisonous snake: O’Ren-Ishii (Lucy Liu) was Cottonmouth, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) was California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) was Copperhead, and Budd (Michael Madsen), Bill’s kid brother and the only other male in the Viper Squad, was known as Sidewinder.  The lethal weapon known as Black Mamba, played by Thurman, the most talented of them all, was also Bill’s lover, and she became a fugitive from the assassination game when she learned that she was pregnant with his child. At that moment her worldview shifted on its axis. She no longer wanted to kill or to put her life in mortal danger. She changed her name, hid out in a small town, and found herself a kind and stable man to a marry.  But Bill was not about to let this situation stand.

For many, it was the moment they believed the war need not be lost.  In Britain in 1942 we needed a boost. We had suffered defeats for the previous two years, and we were demoralised. Morale was at its lowest ebb.  After the Battle of Britain had come the Blitz; I well remember growing up in Brighton. We would shelter from bombs for days or nights on end.  Battle of El Alamein  Date: 23 October 1942  Strategic importance: On the Egyptian coast, El Alamein was seen as a gateway to the Suez & N Africa  In command: General Montgomery (above, left) for Allies, General Rommel (right) for Axis powers  Allied victory: After El Alamein, Allies gained upper-hand in N Africa & swept through to Tripoli  Turning point: As Churchill reflected: "Before Alamein, we never had a victory - after Alamein we never had a defeat"  I remember being hurried by our mother to shelter in the basement, and with the wailing of the sirens, waiting for our father who had lost a leg and part of an arm at Mons in World War I; he took minutes longer than us to get to the shelter.  The British seemed to keep losing battles; we were always on the defensive.  Needing a victory  Germany had invaded Greece and Yugoslavia. Hong Kong had surrendered to the Japanese, who also captured Singapore. Our battleships the Prince of Wales and Repulse had been sunk. U-boats started sinking ships in the Atlantic which were bringing us food and arms.  And bombing at home was continuing - more than 1,000 bombers attacked Canterbury in June 1942.  Thousands of Canadians were killed in the raid on Dieppe.  The strength of the Allies took the Germans by surprise  Somehow we needed a victory.  The longed-for breakthrough came after the start of the Battle of El Alamein on 23 October 1942.  El Alamein is in Egypt, about 50 miles from Alexandria and on the east of the Mediterranean. It\'s a good place to have a swim and get refreshed from the sand and dust you had collected on whatever journey you were on. Most important, as El Alamein is by the sea, ships can unload and cargo can then go on to the trains.  Click here to see a map of El Alamein  At that time in North Africa, the Eighth Army - "The Desert Rats" -  seemed to be holding ground against the Germans. There were many casualties from skirmishes, but it looked like the allies were in good force.  However in January 1942, the Germans under Rommel opened a second offensive, and the Allied losses started again. When Tobruk fell, 30,000 men were captured, many of them South Africans.  Monty\'s plan was the reverse of Rommel\'s  Rommel\'s plan was to attack El Alamein to the east and, going through Egypt, eventually take Cairo.  Montgomery had the reverse plan and wanted somehow to get through the mine fields and attack through the German lines - going west and, hopefully, carrying on through Libya and Tunisia and onwards, eventually leaving the Afrika Korps out of North Africa.  At home, first reports in the papers and on the radio were conservative about what was happening.  On 24 October, the Times said: "The latest information from the western desert, is that apart from patrol activities, there is nothing to report."  However, the next day, it said that "at night the guns have made a barrage like an earthquake". The correspondent wrote: "A man told me that the Germans and Italians alike were badly shaken by the heavy barrage which the Eighth Army attack opened." | Question: In which country did the Battle of El Alamein take place?', ['egypt'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4137'), ("Context: In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE).

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

We caught a few glimpses of the result early in Kill Bill Vol. 1 with the wreckage left behind when Bill and the Vipers assaulted a tiny rural chapel and slaughtered everyone in sight. Vol. 2 gives us, for the first time, a full account of the wedding rehearsal massacre that sets the plot of this two-part epic in motion. After fending off attacks from Bill’s trailer-trash kid brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and her chief rival within the Squad, Daryl Hannah’s Elle Driver, The Bride tracks her ultimate quarry to his lair in Mexico.  It might be a slight exaggeration to describe Kill Bill Vol. 2 as a “relationship movie.” But it may look like one, at times, in comparison with the wall-to-wall Asian swordplay action of Vol. 1 . Both films are still, as Carradine says, “kung-fu samurai Spaghetti Western love stories.” But as the actor noted in a recent published interview: “ The second one has got a lot more of what you’re used to from Quentin; the quirky character stuff, the surprises, the funny stuff.”  In Kill Bill Vol. 1 , actor David Carradine was almost entirely a sinister presence behind the scenes, a familiar, seductive, baritone voice murmuring on the soundtrack\xad—despite the fact that he played the movie’s title role. But along with Uma Thurman, who continues to cut a wide swath as the revenge-driven Bride, “David dominates Vol. 2 ,” according to writer-director Quentin Tarantino.  When I tell people the name of the movie is Kill Bill ,” Carradine says, “and that I’m Bill, they ask me: ‘Well, what are you, the bad guy?’ And I have to tell ’em, ‘There are no good guys in a Quentin Tarantino movie. It’s all about the bad guys.’ The essence of a Tarantino movie is an inside look at the minds and hearts of violent people. That’s what we go to see his movies for. It’s climbing inside these people’s psyches and showing what makes them tick. There’s a nobility about Bill, yet you also know he’s one of the most evil people you’ve ever met in your life. “Bill is more fun than anything,” Carradine recently told The Associated Press. “Bill has virtually no human problems. He’s just kind of put himself above it all.”  In Vol. 1 we learned that Bill, a broker of killers for hire, had assembled and trained a ruthless assortment of assassins, the so-called Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS). Each of these gifted murderers was code-named for a different species of poisonous snake: O’Ren-Ishii (Lucy Liu) was Cottonmouth, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) was California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) was Copperhead, and Budd (Michael Madsen), Bill’s kid brother and the only other male in the Viper Squad, was known as Sidewinder.  The lethal weapon known as Black Mamba, played by Thurman, the most talented of them all, was also Bill’s lover, and she became a fugitive from the assassination game when she learned that she was pregnant with his child.

For many, it was the moment they believed the war need not be lost.  In Britain in 1942 we needed a boost. We had suffered defeats for the previous two years, and we were demoralised. Morale was at its lowest ebb.  After the Battle of Britain had come the Blitz; I well remember growing up in Brighton. We would shelter from bombs for days or nights on end.  Battle of El Alamein  Date: 23 October 1942  Strategic importance: On the Egyptian coast, El Alamein was seen as a gateway to the Suez & N Africa  In command: General Montgomery (above, left) for Allies, General Rommel (right) for Axis powers  Allied victory: After El Alamein, Allies gained upper-hand in N Africa & swept through to Tripoli  Turning point: As Churchill reflected: "Before Alamein, we never had a victory - after Alamein we never had a defeat"  I remember being hurried by our mother to shelter in the basement, and with the wailing of the sirens, waiting for our father who had lost a leg and part of an arm at Mons in World War I; he took minutes longer than us to get to the shelter.  The British seemed to keep losing battles; we were always on the defensive.  Needing a victory  Germany had invaded Greece and Yugoslavia. Hong Kong had surrendered to the Japanese, who also captured Singapore. Our battleships the Prince of Wales and Repulse had been sunk. U-boats started sinking ships in the Atlantic which were bringing us food and arms.  And bombing at home was continuing - more than 1,000 bombers attacked Canterbury in June 1942.  Thousands of Canadians were killed in the raid on Dieppe.  The strength of the Allies took the Germans by surprise  Somehow we needed a victory.  The longed-for breakthrough came after the start of the Battle of El Alamein on 23 October 1942.  El Alamein is in Egypt, about 50 miles from Alexandria and on the east of the Mediterranean. It\'s a good place to have a swim and get refreshed from the sand and dust you had collected on whatever journey you were on. Most important, as El Alamein is by the sea, ships can unload and cargo can then go on to the trains.  Click here to see a map of El Alamein  At that time in North Africa, the Eighth Army - "The Desert Rats" -  seemed to be holding ground against the Germans. There were many casualties from skirmishes, but it looked like the allies were in good force.  However in January 1942, the Germans under Rommel opened a second offensive, and the Allied losses started again. When Tobruk fell, 30,000 men were captured, many of them South Africans.  Monty\'s plan was the reverse of Rommel\'s  Rommel\'s plan was to attack El Alamein to the east and, going through Egypt, eventually take Cairo.  Montgomery had the reverse plan and wanted somehow to get through the mine fields and attack through the German lines - going west and, hopefully, carrying on through Libya and Tunisia and onwards, eventually leaving the Afrika Korps out of North Africa.  At home, first reports in the papers and on the radio were conservative about what was happening.  On 24 October, the Times said: "The latest information from the western desert, is that apart from patrol activities, there is nothing to report."  However, the next day, it said that "at night the guns have made a barrage like an earthquake".

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.

They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea.

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it. After Bond kills Tee Hee, he rescues her out of the bed and they soon make out.

As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields.

Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities "by ancient usage" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891.

It is 7 miles (11 km) from the Venezuelan coast at its nearest point and is separated from it by the Gulf of Paria and two narrow channels, where there are several small islands and rocks.

Zanzibar became independent on 12th December 1963. Prior to her independence, Zanzibar, which was ruled by an Arab Sultanate, and enjoyed a protectorate status under the British. One month after she gained independence, the Arab Sultanate regime of Zanzibar was overthrown by a popular revolution on 12th January 1964, which led to the creation of the Revolution Government of Zanzibar.  \xa0  The Republic of Tanganyika and the Peoples’ Republic of Zanzibar entered into a union on 26th April 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which was later renamed on 29th October the United Republic of Tanzania.  \xa0  At the time of the Union, Tanganyika was governed by a political party know as the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), the nationalist party which won the country its independence, while Zanzibar was rule by the Afro Shiraz Party (ASP) which had lead the popular revolution.  The two states were by then governed under the one party system of government, i.e. the one party state democracy, which was then very prevalent in Africa. In 1977 the TANU and ASP merged to form the Chama Cha Mapinduzi-CCM party, (otherwise known as the Revolutionary Party), which continued to exercise political control through out the country under the one party regime.  \xa0  The United Republic of Tanzania was under the leadership of one party system until 1992 when she adopted a new constitution, which enabled the organization of pluralist political parties, and hence in 1995 the first multi party democratic elections were held in the country. Since 1995 the country has held such multi party elections in 2000, and 2005.  \xa0  Sources of Law  Tanzania’s legal system is based on the English Common Law system. It derived this system from its British colonial legacy, as it does the system of government, which is based to a large degree on the Westminster parliamentary model.

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised.

But it is important. Just as Cicero went through a phase where he used to begin every speech to the senate with the line "Carthage must be destroyed", so I have to say, far more often than I would like: Radio 4\'s comedy output needs a really big overhaul.  There are programmes that ring their own leper-bells, so you know you can avoid them. An all too typical example is Laura Solon: Talking and Not Talking, which goes out at 11.30pm on Wednesdays. The description given on the BBC\'s iPlayer includes the words "packed with bittersweet character monologues and cuttingly modern sketches", which is another way, as even the most cursorily experienced listener will recognise, of saying "not very funny". It illustrates the inverse formula given by Tolstoy about happy and unhappy families: all funny radio sketch shows are funny in different ways, but all unfunny ones are unfunny in the same way. I mean, how many different ways are there of being unfunny?  With marginally more potential, but not much more success, is DoubleScience (Wednesdays, 6.30pm), "a sitcom about two incompetent science teachers who work at a college that specialises in drama". "Incompetent" could fit the bill, in that one of the science teachers concerned, looking at a new poster of the periodic table, observes that radon sounds like something you\'d put in your washing machine. But never mind the marginal desirability of putting this weak joke in the script at all, how likely is it that a science teacher, however incompetent, would say such a thing?  Here is the sport the show makes about the teachers: they like real ale; they play Dungeons and Dragons; they are unsuccessful with women; they have undesirable living quarters; and they speak in comedy voices, one a bit like Neil from The Young Ones and the other like John Major. There is, for good measure, the proprietor of an Indian restaurant who addresses his clientele as "gentlemens".  By fluke rather than by design, my children and I have listened to the last two of these shows. Last week, the eldest, who until then had been in quite a sunny mood, suddenly lost all her joie de vivre and said, "Is this the one that\'s supposed to be funny but isn\'t?" "Let\'s give it a chance," I said. Thirty laugh-free minutes later, the children were looking defeated and mistrustful.  Also conceptually problematic is The Unbelievable Truth which, thanks to presenter David Mitchell and the calibre of many of the guests (Graeme Garden, Tony Hawks), cannot fail to raise a laugh from time to time; but the very format of the show, which is too boring to write out, means that contestants are too busy paying attention to the others\' flights of fancy to fabricate jokes. Its format is also a regression from the principles of I\'m Sorry, I Haven\'t a Clue, which was billed, you will recall, as "the antidote to panel games".  The funniest show on radio, then, for the last few weeks, has been David Quantick\'s The Blagger\'s Guide (Radio 2), whose run is now sadly over.

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule.

The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities "by ancient usage" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891.

Its eastern border is the Indian Ocean, it shares its northern border with the Republic of Kenya and Uganda, and to the West it borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Rwanda and the Republic of Burundi. The Republic of Zambia and the Republic of Malawi share its borders on the southwest, while in the South it shares a border with Mozambique; it is the union of two historical countries, Tanganyika and Zanzibar.  \xa0  The United Republic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 through the union of two independent states, namely the Republic of Tanganyika and the Peoples’ Republic of Zanzibar. Zanzibar is an autonomous part of the United Republic, and is made up of two islands, namely Unguja and Pemba, which are found in the territorial waters of the United Republic, in the Indian Ocean. Another island to the south east of the Tanzania, Mafia, is an integral part of mainland Tanzania.  \xa0  Tanganyika gained its independence from the British, who administered her after the end of the WWII under the United Nations Trusteeship; on 9th December 1961 she became a Republic on 9th December 1962. Zanzibar became independent on 12th December 1963. Prior to her independence, Zanzibar, which was ruled by an Arab Sultanate, and enjoyed a protectorate status under the British. One month after she gained independence, the Arab Sultanate regime of Zanzibar was overthrown by a popular revolution on 12th January 1964, which led to the creation of the Revolution Government of Zanzibar.  \xa0  The Republic of Tanganyika and the Peoples’ Republic of Zanzibar entered into a union on 26th April 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which was later renamed on 29th October the United Republic of Tanzania.  \xa0  At the time of the Union, Tanganyika was governed by a political party know as the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), the nationalist party which won the country its independence, while Zanzibar was rule by the Afro Shiraz Party (ASP) which had lead the popular revolution.  The two states were by then governed under the one party system of government, i.e. the one party state democracy, which was then very prevalent in Africa. In 1977 the TANU and ASP merged to form the Chama Cha Mapinduzi-CCM party, (otherwise known as the Revolutionary Party), which continued to exercise political control through out the country under the one party regime.  \xa0  The United Republic of Tanzania was under the leadership of one party system until 1992 when she adopted a new constitution, which enabled the organization of pluralist political parties, and hence in 1995 the first multi party democratic elections were held in the country. Since 1995 the country has held such multi party elections in 2000, and 2005.  \xa0  Sources of Law  Tanzania’s legal system is based on the English Common Law system. It derived this system from its British colonial legacy, as it does the system of government, which is based to a large degree on the Westminster parliamentary model.  The Constitution  Unlike the unwritten British constitutional system, the first source of law for the United Republic of Tanzania is the 1977 Constitution.  The constitutional history of Tanganyika traces its background from the 1961 Independence Constitution, which was adopted at the time of independence. In 1962 Tanganyika adopted the Republican Constitution, which operated from 1962 up to 1965. These two were | Question: Tanzania was renamed in 1964.

Haggis somewhat resembles stuffed intestines (pig intestines otherwise known as chitterlings or the\xa0kokoretsi\xa0of traditional Polish cuisine), sausages and savoury puddings of which it is among the largest types. As the 2001 English edition of the Larousse Gastronomique puts it, “Although its description is not immediately appealing, haggis has an excellent nutty texture and delicious savoury flavour.” Most modern commercial haggis is prepared in a casing rather than an actual stomach. There are also meat-free recipes for vegetarians. It is often asserted (e.g., on the packaging of MacSween’s haggis) that the dish is traditionally served with “neeps and tatties” (Scots: swede, yellow turnip or rutabaga and potatoes; these are boiled and mashed separately) and a “dram” (i.e. a glass of Scotch whisky). However, it might perhaps be more accurate to describe this as the traditional main course of a Burns supper, since on other occasions haggis may be eaten with other accompaniments. Whisky sauce (made from thickened stock and Scotch whisky) has recently been developed as an elegant addition.  History  The haggis is frequently assumed to be Scottish in origin though there is little evidence for this, and food writer Alan Davidson states that the Ancient Romans were the first people known to have made products of the haggis type. A kind of primitive haggis is referred to in Homer’s Odyssey, in book 20, when Odysseus is compared to “a man before a great blazing fire turning swiftly this way and that a stomach full of fat and blood, very eager to have it roasted quickly.” Haggis was “born of necessity, as a way to utilize the least expensive cuts of meat and the innards as well” (Andrew Zimmern). In times of famine people would eat whatever it was that they could get their hands on, which is how all those fascinating ingredients became a part of Scottish tradition.\xa0Clarissa Dickson Wright repudiates the assumption of a Scottish origin for haggis, claiming that it “came to Scotland in a longship [ie. from Scandinavia] even before Scotland was a single nation.”. Dickson-Wright further cites etymologist Walter William Skeat as further suggestion of possible Scandinavian origins: Skeat claimed that the hag– part of the word is derived from the Old Norse hoggva or the Icelandic haggw, meaning ‘to hew’ or strike with a sharp weapon, relating to the chopped-up contents of the dish. One theory claims that the name “haggis” is derived from Norman French. Norman French was more guttural than normal French so that the “ch” of “hachis”, i.e. “chopped”, was pronounced as the “ch” in “loch”, giving “haggis”. Dickson Wright suggests that haggis was invented as a way of cooking quick-spoiling offal near the site of a hunt, without the need to carry along an additional cooking vessel. The liver and kidneys could be grilled directly over a fire, but this treatment was unsuitable for the stomach, intestines, or lungs. Chopping up the lungs and stuffing the stomach with them and whatever fillers might have been on hand, then boiling the assembly — likely in a vessel made from the animal’s hide — was one way to make sure these parts did not go to waste.  Folklore  In the absence of hard facts as to haggis’ origins, popular folklore has provided more fanciful theories. One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish cattle drovers. When the men left the highlands to drive their cattle to market in Edinburgh the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the glens.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised.

However, each contestant must attempt to smuggle five strange-but-true facts past the rest of the panel, hoping that no-one will notice what they have said is the unbelievable truth.  Laura Solon, Radio 4<br />Double Science ... - The IndependentLaura Solon, Radio 4Double Science, Radio 4The Unbelievable Truth, Radio 4 | The Independent  Saturday 31 May 2008 23:00 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Culture  Regular readers will know that this is a theme I return to again and again. But it is important. Just as Cicero went through a phase where he used to begin every speech to the senate with the line "Carthage must be destroyed", so I have to say, far more often than I would like: Radio 4\'s comedy output needs a really big overhaul.  There are programmes that ring their own leper-bells, so you know you can avoid them. An all too typical example is Laura Solon: Talking and Not Talking, which goes out at 11.30pm on Wednesdays. The description given on the BBC\'s iPlayer includes the words "packed with bittersweet character monologues and cuttingly modern sketches", which is another way, as even the most cursorily experienced listener will recognise, of saying "not very funny". It illustrates the inverse formula given by Tolstoy about happy and unhappy families: all funny radio sketch shows are funny in different ways, but all unfunny ones are unfunny in the same way. I mean, how many different ways are there of being unfunny?  With marginally more potential, but not much more success, is DoubleScience (Wednesdays, 6.30pm), "a sitcom about two incompetent science teachers who work at a college that specialises in drama". "Incompetent" could fit the bill, in that one of the science teachers concerned, looking at a new poster of the periodic table, observes that radon sounds like something you\'d put in your washing machine. But never mind the marginal desirability of putting this weak joke in the script at all, how likely is it that a science teacher, however incompetent, would say such a thing?  Here is the sport the show makes about the teachers: they like real ale; they play Dungeons and Dragons; they are unsuccessful with women; they have undesirable living quarters; and they speak in comedy voices, one a bit like Neil from The Young Ones and the other like John Major. There is, for good measure, the proprietor of an Indian restaurant who addresses his clientele as "gentlemens".  By fluke rather than by design, my children and I have listened to the last two of these shows. Last week, the eldest, who until then had been in quite a sunny mood, suddenly lost all her joie de vivre and said, "Is this the one that\'s supposed to be funny but isn\'t?" "Let\'s give it a chance," I said. Thirty laugh-free minutes later, the children were looking defeated and mistrustful.  Also conceptually problematic is The Unbelievable Truth which, thanks to presenter David Mitchell and the calibre of many of the guests (Graeme Garden, Tony Hawks), cannot fail to raise a laugh from time to time; but the very format of the show, which is too boring to write out, means that contestants are too busy paying attention to the others\' flights of fancy to fabricate jokes. Its format is also a regression from the principles of I\'m Sorry, I Haven\'t a Clue, which was billed, you will recall, as "the antidote to panel games".  The funniest show on radio, then, for the last few weeks, has been David Quantick\'s The Blagger\'s Guide (Radio 2), whose run is now sadly over.

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs. Most cleaning attempts merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.  All four of us went for a ride on the Luas from Milltown to Sandyford and back. During the journey we chatted about the trams as opposed to the buses.

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

They are currently exhibited, free to the public, in the Duveen Gallery in the British Museum. Although today the sculptures appear white, originally they were painted in vivid colors, something that new research is revealing .  A marble frieze from the Parthenon, now displayed in the British Museum, depicts a procession of gods and mortals.  Credit: Mark Higgins Shutterstock  The marbles in London were removed from the Parthenon in the first decade of the 19th century under the auspices of Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin, and were first exhibited in London in 1807. Their removal is deeply controversial and the Greek government has requested that they be repatriated, a debate that has garnered extensive media attention. Not all the sculptures from the Parthenon are in the British Museum; another large portion is still in Athens, while a few other sculptures are in different museums throughout the world.  The Elgin Marbles once adorned the Parthenon in Athens.  Credit: Anastasios71 Shutterstock  The Parthenon  A temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is located on the Acropolis of ancient Athens. It is about 228 feet (69.5 meters) long by 101 feet (30.9 meters) wide and roughly 65 feet (20 meters) high. Construction of the temple started in 447 B.C., with work on its decorations continuing up to about 432 B.C., around the time war broke out with Sparta. At the time the Parthenon was created, Athens was at its height, the city’s vast navy helping it control an empire in the Aegean Sea.  There are three main types of sculptures on the exterior of the Parthenon that are now part of the Elgin Marbles.  Pediments  Pediments are large triangular shaped niches, which contained impressive sculptures, located high up on top of the Parthenon. One pediment is located on the east side of the building and another on the west. The sculptures on the east pediment tell the tale of the birth of the goddess Athena, while those on the west depict a battle between Athena and the god Poseidon to determine who would be the patron deity of Athens. The size of the sculptures varied depending on how close they were to the apex (the highest point) of the triangle.  The most impressive pediment sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles come from the east side and illustrate reactions to the birth of Athena.  According to myth, Athena was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Metis. Zeus was afraid that Athena would become more powerful than him so he swallowed Metis whole while she was pregnant. This did not stop the pregnancy and Athena became so big that Zeus’ head was split open with an axe by the Greek blacksmith god Hephaestus, and the goddess was born.  Unfortunately, the sculptures depicting the head-blowing birth have not survived but the sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles do show the reactions of Greek deities to the birth. British Museum curator Ian Jenkins notes in his book "The Parthenon Sculptures" (Harvard University Press, 2007) that Athena was born “at daybreak” and sculptures show “the sun-god Helios and the heads of two of his four horses,” emerging from the floor of the pediment, rising “as if from the sea.”  Also observing the event is a nude image of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry, who is shown reclining and apparently enjoying a cup of wine, as if toasting the birth. To the right are two seated goddesses who, Jenkins says, are probably Demeter and her daughter Persephone, while further to the right is a heavily draped Greek girl, apparently a mortal human, who has taken flight after viewing the event.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense.

He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply as in its original workshop production or with the grandeur of Seurat\'s masterpiece.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

Good Question: What is Halal Meat?  Email  A Muslim butcher opened recently in our neighborhood and they sell halal meat.  We wondered, what exactly does "halal" mean?  Halal is an Arabic word that means "permissible."  In terms of food, it means food that is permissible according to Islamic law.  For a meat to be certified "halal," it cannot be a forbidden cut (such as meat from hindquarters) or animal (such as pork.)  The slaughter of a halal animal is called "zabihah" and there are certain guidelines to follow:  Allah\'s (God\'s) name must be pronounced during slaughter.  The instrument must be very sharp to ensure humane slaughter.  The animal must be slit at the throat.  The animal must not be unconscious  The animal must be hung upside down and allowed to bleed dry.  Eating blood is not halal.  These steps must be accomplished by a Muslim or the People of the Book (Christian or Jew.)  Many observant Muslims find kosher meat acceptable.  The animal must have been fed a natural diet that did not contain animal by-products.  What Do "Kosher" and "Halal" Mean? - ChowhoundWhat Do "Kosher" and "Halal" Mean? - Chowhound  What Do “Kosher” and “Halal” Mean?  By Jason Horn, published on  Wednesday, March 7, 2007  / Edit Post  What do kosher and halal mean, and what are the differences between them?  Linguistically, at least, they’re very similar. Halal is Arabic for “permissible,” and kosher is Hebrew for “fit” or “proper.” Both refer to anything—not just food—that is allowed or correct under Islamic or Jewish religious laws, respectively. The opposite of halal is haram, meaning “forbidden,” and the opposite of kosher is treif, meaning “torn” and referring to the fact that flesh torn from an animal by wild beasts is not kosher.  Kosher and halal rules both prohibit consuming pork or animal blood of any kind. To be kosher or halal, a land animal or bird must be slaughtered by cutting the throat with a single stroke without cutting the spinal cord. All of the animal’s blood must also be drained completely (kosher salt is so named because the large crystals are good for drawing any residual blood out of meat). Both sets of rules also prohibit birds of prey and allow any other kind of bird. To be kosher, a land animal must have cloven hooves and chew cud (sheep, cattle, goats, deer, and bison are essentially the only kosher animals), but anything that’s not a pig or a carnivore can be halal.  Under kosher rules, a permissible fish must have fins and scales, and cannot be a scavenger or bottom-feeder (wild catfish are treif, but some farm-raised ones can be certified kosher, since their diets are controlled). There is some disagreement among halal authorities about fish. All kosher fish are definitely halal, but some interpretations allow the eating of shellfish. Both sets of rules forbid eating frogs and other amphibians.  As for processed foods, kosher and halal certifications (the most common are the Orthodox Union’s U_ inside an _O for kosher and the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America’s M inside a crescent for halal) verify that no substances derived from forbidden animals are contained in the product, and that it wasn’t made using machines that process treif or haram foods. Some kosher authorities allow animal-derived gelatin because it has been changed so much in processing that it is no longer considered meat, but most halal authorities do not.  The biggest difference between the two is that kosher rules forbid the mixing of meat and dairy products.

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria\'s approach was           significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte           Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste           Libeault of the Nancy           School . Faria\'s theoretical position, and the subsequent           experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant           contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of mile           Cou and the autogenic training techniques of Johannes           Heinrich Schultz .  Reichenbach  Rcamier, in 1821, prior to the           development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used           something resembling hypnoanesthesia and operated on patients under mesmeric coma.  In the 1840s and 1850s , Carl           Reichenbach began experiments to find any scientific validity to "mesmeric" energy, which he termed Odic           force after the Norse god Odin.

The color is also mentioned in their former advertising slogan: “What can Brown do for you?” Originally founder James E. Casey wanted the trucks to be yellow, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom stated they would be impossible to keep clean, and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.  All four of us went for a ride on the Luas from Milltown to Sandyford and back. During the journey we chatted about the trams as opposed to the buses.

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

They are currently exhibited, free to the public, in the Duveen Gallery in the British Museum. Although today the sculptures appear white, originally they were painted in vivid colors, something that new research is revealing .  A marble frieze from the Parthenon, now displayed in the British Museum, depicts a procession of gods and mortals.  Credit: Mark Higgins Shutterstock  The marbles in London were removed from the Parthenon in the first decade of the 19th century under the auspices of Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of Elgin, and were first exhibited in London in 1807. Their removal is deeply controversial and the Greek government has requested that they be repatriated, a debate that has garnered extensive media attention. Not all the sculptures from the Parthenon are in the British Museum; another large portion is still in Athens, while a few other sculptures are in different museums throughout the world.  The Elgin Marbles once adorned the Parthenon in Athens.  Credit: Anastasios71 Shutterstock  The Parthenon  A temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon is located on the Acropolis of ancient Athens. It is about 228 feet (69.5 meters) long by 101 feet (30.9 meters) wide and roughly 65 feet (20 meters) high. Construction of the temple started in 447 B.C., with work on its decorations continuing up to about 432 B.C., around the time war broke out with Sparta. At the time the Parthenon was created, Athens was at its height, the city’s vast navy helping it control an empire in the Aegean Sea.  There are three main types of sculptures on the exterior of the Parthenon that are now part of the Elgin Marbles.  Pediments  Pediments are large triangular shaped niches, which contained impressive sculptures, located high up on top of the Parthenon. One pediment is located on the east side of the building and another on the west. The sculptures on the east pediment tell the tale of the birth of the goddess Athena, while those on the west depict a battle between Athena and the god Poseidon to determine who would be the patron deity of Athens. The size of the sculptures varied depending on how close they were to the apex (the highest point) of the triangle.  The most impressive pediment sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles come from the east side and illustrate reactions to the birth of Athena.  According to myth, Athena was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Metis. Zeus was afraid that Athena would become more powerful than him so he swallowed Metis whole while she was pregnant. This did not stop the pregnancy and Athena became so big that Zeus’ head was split open with an axe by the Greek blacksmith god Hephaestus, and the goddess was born.  Unfortunately, the sculptures depicting the head-blowing birth have not survived but the sculptures that are part of the Elgin Marbles do show the reactions of Greek deities to the birth. British Museum curator Ian Jenkins notes in his book "The Parthenon Sculptures" (Harvard University Press, 2007) that Athena was born “at daybreak” and sculptures show “the sun-god Helios and the heads of two of his four horses,” emerging from the floor of the pediment, rising “as if from the sea.”  Also observing the event is a nude image of Dionysus, god of wine and revelry, who is shown reclining and apparently enjoying a cup of wine, as if toasting the birth. To the right are two seated goddesses who, Jenkins says, are probably Demeter and her daughter Persephone, while further to the right is a heavily draped Greek girl, apparently a mortal human, who has taken flight after viewing the event.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Region  Sunday In The Park With George  Original Broadway Version (1984)  Inspired by George Seurat\'s famous painting, this poetic masterpiece explores the challenges in understanding life and art.  Inspired by the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday In The Park With George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\'s stunning masterpiece merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter Georges Seurat won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding 10 Tony Awards including Best Musical.  The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat\'s artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat\'s descendant - named George and also an artist - finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past.  An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday In The Park With George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine.

Good Question: What is Halal Meat?  Email  A Muslim butcher opened recently in our neighborhood and they sell halal meat.  We wondered, what exactly does "halal" mean?  Halal is an Arabic word that means "permissible."  In terms of food, it means food that is permissible according to Islamic law.  For a meat to be certified "halal," it cannot be a forbidden cut (such as meat from hindquarters) or animal (such as pork.)  The slaughter of a halal animal is called "zabihah" and there are certain guidelines to follow:  Allah\'s (God\'s) name must be pronounced during slaughter.  The instrument must be very sharp to ensure humane slaughter.  The animal must be slit at the throat.  The animal must not be unconscious  The animal must be hung upside down and allowed to bleed dry.  Eating blood is not halal.  These steps must be accomplished by a Muslim or the People of the Book (Christian or Jew.)  Many observant Muslims find kosher meat acceptable.  The animal must have been fed a natural diet that did not contain animal by-products.  What Do "Kosher" and "Halal" Mean? - ChowhoundWhat Do "Kosher" and "Halal" Mean? - Chowhound  What Do “Kosher” and “Halal” Mean?  By Jason Horn, published on  Wednesday, March 7, 2007  / Edit Post  What do kosher and halal mean, and what are the differences between them?  Linguistically, at least, they’re very similar. Halal is Arabic for “permissible,” and kosher is Hebrew for “fit” or “proper.” Both refer to anything—not just food—that is allowed or correct under Islamic or Jewish religious laws, respectively. The opposite of halal is haram, meaning “forbidden,” and the opposite of kosher is treif, meaning “torn” and referring to the fact that flesh torn from an animal by wild beasts is not kosher.  Kosher and halal rules both prohibit consuming pork or animal blood of any kind. To be kosher or halal, a land animal or bird must be slaughtered by cutting the throat with a single stroke without cutting the spinal cord. All of the animal’s blood must also be drained completely (kosher salt is so named because the large crystals are good for drawing any residual blood out of meat). Both sets of rules also prohibit birds of prey and allow any other kind of bird. To be kosher, a land animal must have cloven hooves and chew cud (sheep, cattle, goats, deer, and bison are essentially the only kosher animals), but anything that’s not a pig or a carnivore can be halal.  Under kosher rules, a permissible fish must have fins and scales, and cannot be a scavenger or bottom-feeder (wild catfish are treif, but some farm-raised ones can be certified kosher, since their diets are controlled). There is some disagreement among halal authorities about fish. All kosher fish are definitely halal, but some interpretations allow the eating of shellfish. Both sets of rules forbid eating frogs and other amphibians.  As for processed foods, kosher and halal certifications (the most common are the Orthodox Union’s U_ inside an _O for kosher and the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America’s M inside a crescent for halal) verify that no substances derived from forbidden animals are contained in the product, and that it wasn’t made using machines that process treif or haram foods. Some kosher authorities allow animal-derived gelatin because it has been changed so much in processing that it is no longer considered meat, but most halal authorities do not.  The biggest difference between the two is that kosher rules forbid the mixing of meat and dairy products.

The use of the (conventional) English           term animal magnetism to translate Mesmer\'s magntisme           animal is extremely misleading for three reasons:  Mesmer chose his term to clearly           distinguish his variant of magnetic force from those which were           referred to, at that time, as mineral magnetism, cosmic           magnetism and planetary magnetism.  Mesmer felt that this particular           force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.  Mesmer chose the word "animal",           for its root meaning (from latin animus = "breath")           specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to           all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans and animals.  Mesmer developed his own theory and           inspired himself also to the writings of the English physician Richard           Mead. Mesmer found that, after opening a patient\'s vein and letting           the patient bleed for a while, by passing magnets over the wound would           make the bleeding stop. Mesmer also discovered that using a stick           instead would also make the bleeding stop.  After moving to Paris and becoming           popular with the French aristocracy for his magnetic cures, the           medical community challenged him. The French king put together a Board           of Inquiry that included chemist Lavoisier , Benjamin           Franklin , and a medical doctor who was an expert in pain control           named Joseph           Ignace Guillotin . Mesmer refused to cooperate with the           investigation and this fell to his disciple Dr d\'Eslon. Franklin           constructed an experiment in which a blindfolded patient was shown to           respond as much to a non-prepared tree as to one that had been "magnetised" by d\'Eslon. This is considered to be perhaps the first           placebo-controlled trial of a therapy ever conducted. The commission           later declared that Mesmerism worked by the action of the imagination. [5]  Although Mesmerism remained popular           and "magnetic therapies" are still advertised as a form of "alternative medicine" even today, Mesmer himself retired to           Switzerland in obscurity, where he died in 1815.  Abb           Faria  Abb           Faria  Many of the original mesmerists were           signatories to the first declarations proclaiming the French           revolution in 1789. Far from being surprising, this was almost to be           expected, in that mesmerism had opened up the prospect that the social           order was in some sense suggested and could be overturned. Magnetism was neglected or forgotten during           the Revolution and the Empire.  An Indo- Portuguese priest, Abb Faria, revived public attention to animal magnetism. In the early           19th century, Abb Faria introduced oriental hypnosis to Paris .           Faria came from India and gave exhibitions in 1814 and 1815 without manipulations or the use           of Mesmer\'s baquet.  Unlike Mesmer, Faria claimed that it \'generated from within the mind by the power of           expectancy and cooperation of the patient. Faria\'s approach was           significantly extended by the clinical and theoretical work of Hippolyte           Bernheim and Ambroise-Auguste           Libeault of the Nancy           School . Faria\'s theoretical position, and the subsequent           experiences of those in the Nancy School made significant           contributions to the later autosuggestion techniques of mile           Cou and the autogenic training techniques of Johannes           Heinrich Schultz .  Reichenbach  Rcamier, in 1821, prior to the           development of hypnotism, was the first physician known to have used           something resembling hypnoanesthesia and operated on patients under mesmeric coma.  In the 1840s and 1850s , Carl           Reichenbach began experiments to find any scientific validity to "mesmeric" energy, which he termed Odic           force after the Norse god Odin.

Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.  Since the majority of consumers said that their favourite sweets were either strawberry or blackcurrant flavoured, Fox\'s has also created a new product | Question: What animal is traditionally seen in the branding of Fox\'s Glacier Mints?', ['polar bear'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2327'), ('Context: Slide whistleA slide whistle  (variously known as a swanee or swannee whistle, lotos flute  piston flute,  or jazz flute) is a wind instrument consisting of a fipple like a recorder\'s and a tube with a piston in it. Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

J. A. Hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as: "It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by the races of highest \'social efficiency\'". Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of "Social Darwinism" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: Gibson SG History - Custom Vintage GuitarGibson SG History - Custom Vintage Guitar  You are here: Home » Gibson » Gibson SG History »  Gibson SG History  In 1961, Gibson released the SG, which is a slimmer version of the Les Paul, with a thinner neck and a lower cutaway.  This newly modified version was probably a response to poor sales of the \'Standard\' the previous year, which may in turn have been due to the rising popularity of the more streamlined Stratocaster.  Gibson who have always been quick on the mark when it comes to redesign saw an opportunity to reinvigorate the line and cash in on a modernist shift in ideas, and guitar styles.  Les Paul apparently didn\'t like the design which is not surprising, as the SG lacks the \'pizzazz\' of earlier models such as the \'Gold\', as the SG has quite a plain aesthetic red finish.  His distaste for the new version went so far as him asking for his name to be removed form the guitar, hence why it is called the \'SG\'.  Most SGs have a solid mahogany body and neck, and the traditional combination of bridge and pickup set up.  In line with Gibson\'s policy of appealing to as many players as possible, they released three versions; the Junior, the Standard, and the Custom, appealing to varying levels of playing experience and wallet sizes.   The model was a success, and over the years Gibson has expanded this very popular range with modifications, reissues, and special editions.  When the sub-company Epiphone launched, it released a cheaper version of the SG, which was due to savings made by cutting down on costs for materials, incorporating less features, and hence, it is seen as an inferior model. Pick-guards on the standard were experimented with over the years, until in 1972 when Gibson went back to the original design which seems like a lot of time wasted, but then again that\'s Gibson, they are willing to take a chance by putting it out there, and finding out what people think - the customer is always right! They had tried the larger \'Batwing\', but it didn\'t prove to be very popular.  Vibrato (tremolo arm) tailpieces were also introduced as options, although more recent reissues have gone back to the pre-dated versions.  One highly innovative modification was the introduction of a motorized tuning system in the 2008 released Robot SG.  This invention is obviously a boon for guitarists, especially ones in bands with other members who will even whine that the keyboard is out of tune, never mind the guitar (no joking, anyone who\'s been in a band will have experienced this type of idiocy/egomaniac behaviour).  But, as this technology comes with a pretty heavy price tag, it hasn\'t been adopted on standard guitars.  Eric Clapton\'s SG standard, the "Fool", named after the artist who \'decorated it\', was sold for half a million dollars, previously it had also been owned by Todd Rundgren who had bought it for five hundred dollars.  The SG has always been a favourite of heavy Metal guitarists such as Angus Young of AC/DC, and Tony Lommi of Black Sabbath, although Frank Zappa was also an SG player.  While the internals of the earlier Les Paul and the SG are pretty much the same, it\'s the body that separates them and the differing levels of playability due the specific neck that both models offer.  The SG has been so popular that it is still in production today, and there are no signs of its popularity waning.

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013.

Background of the Show  The Bonanza tv show was set in the time during and  after the Civil War, and was all about the Cartwright family which  included the father, Ben, and his 3 sons Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe.  Did you ever wonder why those 3 brothers  didn\'t look anything alike?  That\'s right!   Each one had a different  mother and none of those women had survived!  Wow; Ben had his share of  bad luck in that department!  Not wanting to mess up a successful  formula, the show stayed consistent with that theme - any love interest  that developed for a Cartwright man didn\'t last any longer than a cold  drink on a hot day!  Here\'s a little bit about the Bonanza cast -  Ben (played by Lorne Greene) was the owner  of the very large (1,000 square miles) and very prosperous Ponderosa  Ranch, which was situated around Lake Tahoe in Nevada.  Adam (played be Pernell Roberts) was the  oldest son.  He was an architect and built that great ranch house where  the Cartwrights lived.  Adam was handsome and always dressed in black -  quiet, serious, the strong, silent type!  Next was Eric (played by Dan Blocker), but  we all knew him as Hoss, who obviously got that nickname because of his  size.  He was a big guy who looked even bigger in his trademark  10-gallon hat.  Hoss was gentle, sometimes naive, and not the brightest  member of the clan!  And then there was Little Joe (my personal  favorite - played by Michael Landon) who was the youngest.  He was  hot-headed and, with his good looks and flashy smile, quite the ladies  man!  DID YOU KNOW?  Bonanza came close to being  cancelled at the end of its first year!  But the fact that it was  considered a "novelty" because it was shown in color made all the  difference! RCA, the parent company of NBC, wanted to sell more color  television sets so they used Bonanza as a marketing gimmick and moved it  to a prime Sunday night timeslot believing it would attract more  viewers there!

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.  Edinburgh and Glasgow were confirmed as cities "by ancient usage" in the 18th century, as was Aberdeen, and this was later reconfirmed in the Act enlarging the burgh in 1891.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941.

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

The girl, just turned six, is improving her counting by determinedly calling out the number of each step.  ‘Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-NINE!’ she says in triumph as they step off onto the sand.  Thus Alice Buchan gave the title to her father’s, my grandfather’s, new novel, little knowing that it would prove to be one of the most enduring adventure stories ever to be published.  John Buchan wrote The 39 Steps in a few weeks towards the end of 1914, while staying with his wife and children at Broadstairs in Kent, in a house on the cliffs overlooking Stone Bay. (The house is still there; indeed, anyone wishing to re-enact the novel’s finale may rent it as a holiday let.)  While there, he became ill with the duodenal problems that plagued him all his life, and which had prevented him from joining the Army, Britain having declared war against Germany on August 4 that year. Two major elements among these facts – the clifftop setting and the coming of war – infuse what has come to be widely regarded as the first modern spy thriller.  Buchan posted the manuscript to Blackwood & Sons in Edinburgh, publisher not only of books but of the famous literary magazine that bore its name.  ‘It has amused me to write, but whether it will amuse you to read is another matter,’ he wrote.  He need not have fretted. Blackwood’s accepted it at once and published it in the magazine, in serial form and pseudonymously, between July and September 1915, and as a book under Buchan’s name in October. It was an immediate success – and more than that, it has become a classic of its kind.  Today, the principal charges levelled against the novel are that it is dated, and that it relies too heavily upon improbable circumstances or coincidences. Yet I would argue that even now, almost 100 years after it was first published, the story retains a modernity that is little short of astonishing.  Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, released in 1935, is an extremely well-made comedy thriller that's widely and deservedly admired  I am reminded of its place in our collective narrative by a cartoon I clipped from a newspaper a few years ago and pinned to my office wall.

Eyes closed as in serious thought, he is drawing on a pipe clamped between his teeth, the bowl of which he’s holding in his left hand. In his right, half wedged beneath his arm, he holds a copy of The 39 Steps. Anxiously, his mother is saying to her husband, ‘Why doesn’t he read Harry Potter, like other kids?’ Why indeed?  True, The 39 Steps isn’t read by the young (or old) in anything like the numbers that JK Rowling’s marvellous creation attracts, but it’s still in print nearly 100 years after its first publication; indeed, it has never been out of print, something that isn’t true of the works of, for instance, Jane Austen.

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule.

His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism. The purportedly scientific nature of "Social Darwinism" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.

The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

This newly modified version was probably a response to poor sales of the \'Standard\' the previous year, which may in turn have been due to the rising popularity of the more streamlined Stratocaster.  Gibson who have always been quick on the mark when it comes to redesign saw an opportunity to reinvigorate the line and cash in on a modernist shift in ideas, and guitar styles.  Les Paul apparently didn\'t like the design which is not surprising, as the SG lacks the \'pizzazz\' of earlier models such as the \'Gold\', as the SG has quite a plain aesthetic red finish.  His distaste for the new version went so far as him asking for his name to be removed form the guitar, hence why it is called the \'SG\'.  Most SGs have a solid mahogany body and neck, and the traditional combination of bridge and pickup set up.  In line with Gibson\'s policy of appealing to as many players as possible, they released three versions; the Junior, the Standard, and the Custom, appealing to varying levels of playing experience and wallet sizes.   The model was a success, and over the years Gibson has expanded this very popular range with modifications, reissues, and special editions.  When the sub-company Epiphone launched, it released a cheaper version of the SG, which was due to savings made by cutting down on costs for materials, incorporating less features, and hence, it is seen as an inferior model. Pick-guards on the standard were experimented with over the years, until in 1972 when Gibson went back to the original design which seems like a lot of time wasted, but then again that\'s Gibson, they are willing to take a chance by putting it out there, and finding out what people think - the customer is always right! They had tried the larger \'Batwing\', but it didn\'t prove to be very popular.  Vibrato (tremolo arm) tailpieces were also introduced as options, although more recent reissues have gone back to the pre-dated versions.  One highly innovative modification was the introduction of a motorized tuning system in the 2008 released Robot SG.  This invention is obviously a boon for guitarists, especially ones in bands with other members who will even whine that the keyboard is out of tune, never mind the guitar (no joking, anyone who\'s been in a band will have experienced this type of idiocy/egomaniac behaviour).  But, as this technology comes with a pretty heavy price tag, it hasn\'t been adopted on standard guitars.  Eric Clapton\'s SG standard, the "Fool", named after the artist who \'decorated it\', was sold for half a million dollars, previously it had also been owned by Todd Rundgren who had bought it for five hundred dollars.  The SG has always been a favourite of heavy Metal guitarists such as Angus Young of AC/DC, and Tony Lommi of Black Sabbath, although Frank Zappa was also an SG player.  While the internals of the earlier Les Paul and the SG are pretty much the same, it\'s the body that separates them and the differing levels of playability due the specific neck that both models offer.  The SG has been so popular that it is still in production today, and there are no signs of its popularity waning.

He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013.

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings.

Background of the Show  The Bonanza tv show was set in the time during and  after the Civil War, and was all about the Cartwright family which  included the father, Ben, and his 3 sons Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe.  Did you ever wonder why those 3 brothers  didn\'t look anything alike?  That\'s right!   Each one had a different  mother and none of those women had survived!  Wow; Ben had his share of  bad luck in that department!  Not wanting to mess up a successful  formula, the show stayed consistent with that theme - any love interest  that developed for a Cartwright man didn\'t last any longer than a cold  drink on a hot day!  Here\'s a little bit about the Bonanza cast -  Ben (played by Lorne Greene) was the owner  of the very large (1,000 square miles) and very prosperous Ponderosa  Ranch, which was situated around Lake Tahoe in Nevada.  Adam (played be Pernell Roberts) was the  oldest son.  He was an architect and built that great ranch house where  the Cartwrights lived.  Adam was handsome and always dressed in black -  quiet, serious, the strong, silent type!  Next was Eric (played by Dan Blocker), but  we all knew him as Hoss, who obviously got that nickname because of his  size.  He was a big guy who looked even bigger in his trademark  10-gallon hat.  Hoss was gentle, sometimes naive, and not the brightest  member of the clan!  And then there was Little Joe (my personal  favorite - played by Michael Landon) who was the youngest.  He was  hot-headed and, with his good looks and flashy smile, quite the ladies  man!  DID YOU KNOW?  Bonanza came close to being  cancelled at the end of its first year!  But the fact that it was  considered a "novelty" because it was shown in color made all the  difference! RCA, the parent company of NBC, wanted to sell more color  television sets so they used Bonanza as a marketing gimmick and moved it  to a prime Sunday night timeslot believing it would attract more  viewers there!  Obviously they were right; Bonanza was in the Top 5  shows for 9 of its 14 years on TV.  All About the Show  Unlike the usual shoot\'em-up, Bonanza  was the first “dramatic” TV Western show.

Each episode usually had a  serious theme to it, something "issue-oriented", built around themes  such as racism, prejudice and social injustice.  This was a first for TV  because the networks were afraid of letters they might receive.  Another first for Bonanza - it was the first Western to be televised in color.

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread.

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

The girl, just turned six, is improving her counting by determinedly calling out the number of each step.  ‘Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-NINE!’ she says in triumph as they step off onto the sand.  Thus Alice Buchan gave the title to her father’s, my grandfather’s, new novel, little knowing that it would prove to be one of the most enduring adventure stories ever to be published.  John Buchan wrote The 39 Steps in a few weeks towards the end of 1914, while staying with his wife and children at Broadstairs in Kent, in a house on the cliffs overlooking Stone Bay. (The house is still there; indeed, anyone wishing to re-enact the novel’s finale may rent it as a holiday let.)  While there, he became ill with the duodenal problems that plagued him all his life, and which had prevented him from joining the Army, Britain having declared war against Germany on August 4 that year. Two major elements among these facts – the clifftop setting and the coming of war – infuse what has come to be widely regarded as the first modern spy thriller.  Buchan posted the manuscript to Blackwood & Sons in Edinburgh, publisher not only of books but of the famous literary magazine that bore its name.  ‘It has amused me to write, but whether it will amuse you to read is another matter,’ he wrote.  He need not have fretted. Blackwood’s accepted it at once and published it in the magazine, in serial form and pseudonymously, between July and September 1915, and as a book under Buchan’s name in October. It was an immediate success – and more than that, it has become a classic of its kind.  Today, the principal charges levelled against the novel are that it is dated, and that it relies too heavily upon improbable circumstances or coincidences. Yet I would argue that even now, almost 100 years after it was first published, the story retains a modernity that is little short of astonishing.  Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, released in 1935, is an extremely well-made comedy thriller that's widely and deservedly admired  I am reminded of its place in our collective narrative by a cartoon I clipped from a newspaper a few years ago and pinned to my office wall.

Eyes closed as in serious thought, he is drawing on a pipe clamped between his teeth, the bowl of which he’s holding in his left hand. In his right, half wedged beneath his arm, he holds a copy of The 39 Steps. Anxiously, his mother is saying to her husband, ‘Why doesn’t he read Harry Potter, like other kids?’ Why indeed?  True, The 39 Steps isn’t read by the young (or old) in anything like the numbers that JK Rowling’s marvellous creation attracts, but it’s still in print nearly 100 years after its first publication; indeed, it has never been out of print, something that isn’t true of the works of, for instance, Jane Austen.

American Revolution (1775–1783) Great Britain forced its 13 American colonies to pay     taxes but did not give them representation in the British Parliament. This     and other injustices led the colonies to declare independence on July 4,     1776. Independence was achieved in 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was     signed with Britain.  War of 1812 (1812–1815) British interference with American trade,     impressment of American seamen, and “war hawks” in Congress calling for     western expansion into British territory led to war. At the war's     conclusion, trade issues remained unresolved, but Britain gave up some of     its territorial claims on the continent.  Mexican War (1846–1848) The U.S. annexation of Texas, and its stated desire     to acquire California and other Mexican territory, precipitated this war.     Mexico was forced to give up two-fifths of its territory. This land     eventually became the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico,     and Utah.  Civil War (1861–1865) Economic and political rivalry between an agrarian     South and an industrial North grew into a civil war fought over slavery     and states' rights. Eleven states seceded from the Union to form the     Confederate States of America. The Union victory led to the reunification     of the country and ended slavery.  Indian Wars (colonial era to 1890) U.S. expansionism led to numerous military conflicts     with the indigenous inhabitants of North America, forcing them to give up     their land. The massacre at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1890 is generally     considered the last of these conflicts.  Spanish American War (1898) The U.S. supported Cuba's desire for independence     from Spanish rule, and seized the opportunity to expand U.S. powers in     other parts of the world. At the end of the brief conflict, Cuba gained     its independence, and the U.S. gained several former Spanish territories:     Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.  World War I (1914–1918) Rivalries over power, territory, and wealth led to     the “Great War.” In 1917, the U.S. joined the Allies (Britain, France,     Russia, Italy, and Japan), who were at war with the Central Powers     (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey), after German submarines     began sinking unarmed ships.  World War II (1939–1945) The Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—attempted     to dominate the world. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, USSR, and     others) fought to stop them. The United States entered the war in 1941,     after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Germany surrendered in 1945, and     Japan surrendered later that same year, after the U.S. dropped the atomic     bomb on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Korean War (1950–1953) Communist North Korea, supported by China, invaded     non-communist South Korea. UN forces, principally made up of U.S. troops,     fought successfully to protect South Korea. The Korean War was the first     armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism,     called the cold war.  Bay of Pigs (1961) The U.S. orchestrated the invasion, an unsuccessful     attempt by Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist regime in     Cuba.  Vietnam War (1961–1973) In 1955, communist North Vietnam invaded     non-communist South Vietnam in an attempt to unify the country and impose     communist rule.

His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry.

It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

They think it\'s all over - it is now!"  Photo: PA  Kenneth Wolstenholme | Obituaries | News | The IndependentKenneth Wolstenholme | The Independent  Kenneth Wolstenholme  Wednesday 27 March 2002 00:00 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  Kenneth Wolstenholme, sports commentator: born Worsley, Lancashire 17 July 1920; DFC 1944, bar 1945; married (one daughter); died Torquay, Devon 25 March 2002.  There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

Overview  The skull is a bony structure found in many animals which serves as the general framework for the head . The skull supports the structures of the face and protects the head against injury.  The skull can be subdivided into two parts:  the cranium and the mandible. A skull that is missing a mandible is only a cranium; this is the source of a very commonly made error in terminology. Those animals having skulls are called craniates.  Protection of the brain is only one part of the function of a bony skull. For example, a fixed distance between the eyes is essential for stereoscopic vision , and a fixed position for the ears helps the brain to use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.  Human skulls  Human skull (front)  Human skull (side)  In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones . Except for the mandible , all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures , rigid articulations permitting very little movement.  Eight bones form the neurocranium (braincase), a protective vault surrounding the brain . Fourteen bones form the splanchnocranium, the bones supporting the face. Encased within the temporal bones are the six ear ossicles of the middle ears , though these are not part of the skull. The hyoid bone , supporting the tongue , is usually not considered as part of the skull either, as it does not articulate with any other bones.  The skull contains the sinus cavities , which are air-filled cavities lined with respiratory epithelium , which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are unclear; they may contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength,or they may be important in improving the resonance of the voice. In some animals, such as the elephant, the sinuses are extensive. The elephant skull needs to be very large, to form an attachment for muscles of the neck and trunk, but is also unexpectedly light; the comparatively small brain-case is surrounded by large sinuses which reduce the weight. The meninges are the three layers, or membranes, which surround the structures of the nervous system . They are known as the dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . Other than being classified together, they have little in common with each other.  In humans, the anatomical position for the skull is the Frankfurt plane , where the lower margins of the orbits and the upper borders of the ear canals are all in a horizontal plane. This is the position where the subject is standing and looking directly forward. For comparison, the skulls of other species, notably primates and hominids, may sometimes be studied in the Frankfurt plane. However, this does not always equate to a natural posture in life.  Possible types of skull fractures  Temporal Fenestra  This Massospondylus skull shows the two temporal fenestrae typical of diapsids .  The temporal fenestra are anatomical features of the amniote skull, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra is critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.  Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but the more advanced sauropsids and synapsids did. As time progressed, sauropsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. | Question: In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones, which are joined together by sutures, rigid articulations permitting very little movement, except for which one?", ['jaw'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2850'), ('Context: Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.  Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong .  The 1990 book Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton , while the 1993 movie Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg . Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.

Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes.

In this painting the couple belongs to the latter group.  Their yard has become a field that is in the process of being overrun by locust trees, and the couple huddles near a grand house that seems alien to them—a house that belongs to another era and bespeaks a refinement that is inconsistent with their work-worn appearance.  Hopper\'s great culminating picture of Cape Cod in the 1930s is Cape Cod Evening (1939). In the ledger book, Jo [Hopper\'s wife] notes:  Cape Cod Evening—finished July 30, 1939.  Note design on glass door and house. Young man... good looking Swede. Was to have been called "Whipporwill" [sic] Dog hears it.... Woman a Finn & dour. Trees in phalanx position, creeping up on one with the dar[k]. The Whipporwill [sic] is there out of sight. Painted in S. Truro Studio. (Vol. II)  Lloyd Goodrich has quoted Hopper\'s own account of the painting:  It is no exact transcription of a place, but pieced together from sketches and mental impressions of things in the vicinity. The grove of locust trees was done from sketches nearby. The doorway of the house comes from Orleans about twenty miles from here.  The figures were done almost entirely without models, and the dry, blowing grass can be seen from my studio window in the late summer or autumn. In the woman I attempted to get the broad, strong-jawed face and blond hair of a Finnish type of which there are many on the Cape. The man is a dark-haired Yankee. The dog is listening to something, probably a whippoorwill or some evening sound.  Several aspects of both descriptions need to be elaborated on: (1) the scene is late summer or autumn, (2) the couple is of immigrant stock or a mixture of immigrant (the man who may be Swedish and the woman who is definitely Finnish) and local (the man whom Edward Hopper refers to as "Yankee"), (3) the dog responds to the sound of the whippoorwill outside the painting, and (4) nature is once again taking over: the trees are regarded as a phalanx, and night is approaching.  Cape Cod Evening is concerned with the loss of a viable rural America: it focuses on those people and places that have been left in the wake of progress. Today it is rarely remembered how enormous were the differences between the rural and urban population in the late 1930s. At that time three out of every four farms were lit by kerosene lamps, a quarter of the rural homes lacked running water, and a third were without flush toilets. Cape Cod Evening was created the same year as the New York World\'s Fair, which was entitled The World of Tomorrow. The fair featured a robot called Elektro, which could talk and smoke, and an exhibit organized by GM entitled Futurama. Designed by Norman Bel Geddes, the GM exhibition drew twenty-eight thousand paying customers a day who sat on a conveyor belt armchair for fifteen minutes and listened to a recorded voice explaining what the American landscape would be like in 1960. To a generation that had been burdened by the Depression, Bel Geddes\'s predictions were less important for their accurate forecasting than for the fact that he was offering people an opportunity to begin thinking optimistically about the future.  In Cape Cod Evening Hopper creates a complete contrast to The World of Tomorrow by picturing a future that is retrograde. He shows how nature is reclaiming land, which less than a century before had been domesticated into the site of an imposing Victorian house with its attendant garden. Although the collie in the preliminary drawing for this painting is turned toward the couple, in the completed painting it directs its attention to the sound of the whippoorwill, which symbolizes the power of nature over culture.

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa.

Based on Kenneth Cook\'s 1961 novel of the same name, the film follows a young schoolteacher from Sydney who descends into personal moral degradation after finding himself stranded in a brutal, menacing town in outback Australia. | Question: What nationality is the director of the 1971 film Wake in Fright?', ['Velichko Todorov Tsochev) is a Bulgarian-Canadian'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-3440'), ("Context: World War I ( often abbreviated to WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War , the Great War , or the War to End All Wars , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents ' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history and precipitated major political change , including the Revolutions of 1917 -- 1923 in many of the nations involved . Unresolved rivalries at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War twenty - one years later . | Question: when did war world 1 start and end ?", ['28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-46380'), ("Context: Evie Ethel Garland ( Maureen Flannigan ) -- Evie is a half - human , half - alien girl who lives with her mother in Marlowe , California ( a fictional analogue of Carmel - by - the - Sea ) , in a house overlooking the sea . She is an only child . Evie attends a school for gifted children ( run by her mother ) and achieves good grades there . Her mother had always told Evie that her father was a secret agent , but on her thirteenth birthday Evie began to develop superhuman abilities and it was revealed that her father is an extraterrestrial from the planet Antareus . Evie 's main power is the ability to freeze time on Earth by touching the tips of her index fingers together , allowing her to maneuver herself or objects to alter the course of events on Earth . When she claps her hands together , time resumes as normal . She can also `` unfreeze '' individuals by touching them while time is frozen . She later gains the power to gleep , which allows her to manifest objects by using the power of her mind . Her father describes her as `` the perfect child : loving ; caring ; with the same needs of most teenagers '' . The series follows Evie through her teenage years , from her thirteenth birthday in the first episode to her eighteenth birthday in the final episode . Although she was the leading character , Flannigan was billed last in the credits . In the first season , she received the billing `` And Introducing Maureen Flannigan '' . In the last 3 seasons , she was billed as `` And Maureen Flannigan as Evie '' .   Donna Garland ( Donna Pescow ) -- Evie 's mother . Described by her husband as `` an ambitious working mother with a career '' , Donna runs a school for gifted children , which Evie attends . She later founds her own catering company , `` Donna 's Delights '' . Toward the end of season 3 , Donna becomes the mayor of Marlowe . Donna is very protective of her daughter , often to the dismay of Evie , who would like to be more independent . Donna and Evie 's Uncle Beano ( then later Uncle Mick ) are the only regular characters on the show who know Evie 's secret .   Troy Garland ( Burt Reynolds , voice only ) -- Evie 's father . Troy is a human - looking extraterrestrial , with many special powers , from the planet Antareus . Troy met Donna when his spacecraft crashed on Earth at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s . The two fell in love , were married in 1971 , and two years later Donna gave birth to Evie . Shortly after , in 1974 , Troy was called back to Antareus to fight in a war . Since then , Troy occasionally visits Earth , and stays in touch with his daughter via a special communication device known as the `` cube '' ( see below ) . Troy 's powers seem to be almost limitless : though he lives on Antareus , he can control many things on Earth ( from computers to the weather ) ; he can give and take away Evie 's powers at will ; and also seems to be aware of certain events on Earth . While Troy appears in the show 's opening credits , he rarely makes a physical appearance in the series -- and when he does his face is obscured ( for example , via a surgical mask or shadows ) . In the series finale , when Troy arrives on Earth , he is seen in a silhouette with stars from the galaxy . Troy was credited as `` himself '' in the opening credits from Season Two onwards .   Beano Froelich ( 1987 -- 1990 ) ( Joe Alaskey ) -- `` Uncle Beano '' is Donna 's brother and Evie 's uncle , who lives next door to them . Beano has a large appetite and runs the diet clinic known originally as `` Waist - a-Weigh '' , and later as `` Beano 's Diet Clinic '' . Beano is one of the two regular characters who know Evie 's secret , along with Donna . He last appears in season 4 , episode 12 .

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)  In 1960, Alfie Bass and Bill Fraser marched their beloved characters into civvy street for\xa0 Bootsie and Snudge .

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ("Context: Robin Gibb: a Bee Gee's secret history - Telegraph.co.ukRobin Gibb: a Bee Gee's secret history - Telegraph  Music  Robin Gibb: a Bee Gee's secret history  Robin Gibb: 'One is a twin for life.

He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings. On the first Friday of each month, crowds of locals and visitors head to the First Friday Gallery Hop at Railroad Square, a former lumber yard in downtown Tallahassee that is now home to over 50 eclectic shops, galleries and art studios.

Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300.

By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

He became friends with Norikata 's assistant , a local girl called Shirley who was four years older than him , developing a crush on her .

Two years later , Kiritsugu was hired by the Einzbern family to be their representative in the coming conflict . Believing that the Holy Grail could grant his wish for world peace , he left behind his former work . Despite being the true Master of the Einzbern family , Kiritsugu operates mostly in the background during the conflict , ambushing other Masters when they are otherwise occupied , while Saber is partnered with Irisviel and made to act out in the open . This is to avoid conflict between Kiritsugu and Saber , as the methodologies of the two conflict with each other too much . Over the course of the War , Kiritsugu 's mask of stoicism begins to crack , revealing the cold assassin to be nothing but an unstable manchild who fears not being able to let go of his wife when the time comes .

Overview  The skull is a bony structure found in many animals which serves as the general framework for the head . The skull supports the structures of the face and protects the head against injury.  The skull can be subdivided into two parts:  the cranium and the mandible. A skull that is missing a mandible is only a cranium; this is the source of a very commonly made error in terminology. Those animals having skulls are called craniates.  Protection of the brain is only one part of the function of a bony skull. For example, a fixed distance between the eyes is essential for stereoscopic vision , and a fixed position for the ears helps the brain to use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.  Human skulls  Human skull (front)  Human skull (side)  In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones . Except for the mandible , all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures , rigid articulations permitting very little movement.  Eight bones form the neurocranium (braincase), a protective vault surrounding the brain . Fourteen bones form the splanchnocranium, the bones supporting the face. Encased within the temporal bones are the six ear ossicles of the middle ears , though these are not part of the skull. The hyoid bone , supporting the tongue , is usually not considered as part of the skull either, as it does not articulate with any other bones.  The skull contains the sinus cavities , which are air-filled cavities lined with respiratory epithelium , which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are unclear; they may contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength,or they may be important in improving the resonance of the voice. In some animals, such as the elephant, the sinuses are extensive. The elephant skull needs to be very large, to form an attachment for muscles of the neck and trunk, but is also unexpectedly light; the comparatively small brain-case is surrounded by large sinuses which reduce the weight. The meninges are the three layers, or membranes, which surround the structures of the nervous system . They are known as the dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . Other than being classified together, they have little in common with each other.  In humans, the anatomical position for the skull is the Frankfurt plane , where the lower margins of the orbits and the upper borders of the ear canals are all in a horizontal plane. This is the position where the subject is standing and looking directly forward. For comparison, the skulls of other species, notably primates and hominids, may sometimes be studied in the Frankfurt plane. However, this does not always equate to a natural posture in life.  Possible types of skull fractures  Temporal Fenestra  This Massospondylus skull shows the two temporal fenestrae typical of diapsids .  The temporal fenestra are anatomical features of the amniote skull, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra is critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.  Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but the more advanced sauropsids and synapsids did. As time progressed, sauropsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. | Question: In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones, which are joined together by sutures, rigid articulations permitting very little movement, except for which one?", ['jaw'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2850'), ('Context: Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

Violet Kray, 72, died of cancer last week.  It was the first time the Krays, 49, had been seen in public since being sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in 1969.  Security was tight for the funeral service in east London.  Criminal twins  The brothers arrived separately - both were handcuffed to a prison guard and flanked by police officers.  Ronnie Kray was brought from Broadmoor Hospital for the criminally insane in Berkshire where he has spent the last four years.  His brother travelled from Parkhurst Prison in the Isle of Wight where he is still held as a maximum security Category "A" prisoner.  The service was attended by a number of celebrities and underworld figures known to the twins from the days when they ran one of London\'s biggest criminal operations.  Among them was actress Diana Dors who arrived wearing a black dress and sunglasses and carrying a bouquet.

There is little doubt that Stevenson would have liked solemnly to don the black cap and sentence them to the end he believed they richly deserved  -  dangling, necks broken, from a rope after a 9am walk to the gallows at Wandsworth or Pentonville.

Then later there\'s running, and screaming."  — Dr. Ian Malcolm , in The Lost World: Jurassic Park , neatly summarizes each of the movies in the series.  Scientists discover the ability to bring extinct animals back to life via a complex cloning process. To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.  Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong .  The 1990 book Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton , while the 1993 movie Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg . Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008. But it all worked out, and the fourth film, titled Jurassic World , was released in 2015. After a highly successful run at the box office, positive reviews, and a resurrection of the franchise in general, a fifth film is to be released on June 22, 2018.

Both human female characters in the first film are more capable than their counterparts in the book.

In this painting the couple belongs to the latter group.  Their yard has become a field that is in the process of being overrun by locust trees, and the couple huddles near a grand house that seems alien to them—a house that belongs to another era and bespeaks a refinement that is inconsistent with their work-worn appearance.  Hopper\'s great culminating picture of Cape Cod in the 1930s is Cape Cod Evening (1939). In the ledger book, Jo [Hopper\'s wife] notes:  Cape Cod Evening—finished July 30, 1939.  Note design on glass door and house. Young man... good looking Swede. Was to have been called "Whipporwill" [sic] Dog hears it.... Woman a Finn & dour. Trees in phalanx position, creeping up on one with the dar[k]. The Whipporwill [sic] is there out of sight. Painted in S. Truro Studio. (Vol. II)  Lloyd Goodrich has quoted Hopper\'s own account of the painting:  It is no exact transcription of a place, but pieced together from sketches and mental impressions of things in the vicinity. The grove of locust trees was done from sketches nearby. The doorway of the house comes from Orleans about twenty miles from here.  The figures were done almost entirely without models, and the dry, blowing grass can be seen from my studio window in the late summer or autumn. In the woman I attempted to get the broad, strong-jawed face and blond hair of a Finnish type of which there are many on the Cape. The man is a dark-haired Yankee. The dog is listening to something, probably a whippoorwill or some evening sound.  Several aspects of both descriptions need to be elaborated on: (1) the scene is late summer or autumn, (2) the couple is of immigrant stock or a mixture of immigrant (the man who may be Swedish and the woman who is definitely Finnish) and local (the man whom Edward Hopper refers to as "Yankee"), (3) the dog responds to the sound of the whippoorwill outside the painting, and (4) nature is once again taking over: the trees are regarded as a phalanx, and night is approaching.  Cape Cod Evening is concerned with the loss of a viable rural America: it focuses on those people and places that have been left in the wake of progress. Today it is rarely remembered how enormous were the differences between the rural and urban population in the late 1930s. At that time three out of every four farms were lit by kerosene lamps, a quarter of the rural homes lacked running water, and a third were without flush toilets. Cape Cod Evening was created the same year as the New York World\'s Fair, which was entitled The World of Tomorrow. The fair featured a robot called Elektro, which could talk and smoke, and an exhibit organized by GM entitled Futurama. Designed by Norman Bel Geddes, the GM exhibition drew twenty-eight thousand paying customers a day who sat on a conveyor belt armchair for fifteen minutes and listened to a recorded voice explaining what the American landscape would be like in 1960. To a generation that had been burdened by the Depression, Bel Geddes\'s predictions were less important for their accurate forecasting than for the fact that he was offering people an opportunity to begin thinking optimistically about the future.  In Cape Cod Evening Hopper creates a complete contrast to The World of Tomorrow by picturing a future that is retrograde. He shows how nature is reclaiming land, which less than a century before had been domesticated into the site of an imposing Victorian house with its attendant garden. Although the collie in the preliminary drawing for this painting is turned toward the couple, in the completed painting it directs its attention to the sound of the whippoorwill, which symbolizes the power of nature over culture.

Couscous is a staple food throughout the North African cuisines of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and Trapani in Sicily.  Etymology  The original name is derived from the Arabic word Keskes, which refers to the cookingpot in which the dish is prepared.   Numerous different names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world. Couscous is or in the United Kingdom and only the latter in the United States. It is in , pronounced kuskusi, while it is also known in Morocco as seksu or kesksu ; in Algeria as seksu or ṭa`ām (, literally meaning "food") ; in Tunisia and Libya kosksi or kuseksi , in Egypt kuskusi (), ; and keskes in Tuareg.   History  The origin of couscous is uncertain. Lucie Bolens affirms that Berbers were preparing couscous as early as 238 to 149 b.c.e.Lucie Bolens described primitive couscous pots found in tombs dating back to the reign of the Berber King Massinissa.  Nevertheless, Charles Perry states that couscous originated between the end of the Zirid dynasty and the rise of the Almohadian dynasty between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries.   The remains of the first vessels ( known ) in the Tiaret region ( Algeria ) where cooking tools dating from the ninth century have been discovered, very strongly resemble the primary tool for cooking couscous    One of the first written references is from an anonymous 13th-century North African cookbook, Kitāb al-tabǐkh fǐ al-Maghrib wa\'l-Andalus "The cookbook of the Maghreb and Andalusia", with a recipe for couscous that was \'known all over the world\'. To this day, couscous is known as \'the North Africa national dish\'.   Couscous was known to the Nasrid royalty in Granada as well. And in the 13th century a Syrian historian from Aleppo includes four references for couscous. These early mentions show that couscous spread rapidly, but generally that couscous was common from Tripolitania to the west, while from Cyrenaica to the east the main cuisine was Egyptian, with couscous as an occasional dish. Today, in Egypt and the Middle East, couscous is known, but in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya couscous is a staple.  It is also common in Western Africa whence it has spread into Central Africa. It is the national dish of the Maghreb countries. Couscous reached Turkey from Syria to in the 16th century and is eaten in most of the Turkish southern provinces.  Couscous is a traditional dish in Trapani, Sicily. In Rome Bartolomeo Scappi\'s culinary guide of 1570 describes a Moorish dish, succussu.   One of the earliest references to couscous in France is in Brittany, in a letter dated January 12, 1699. But it made an earlier appearance in Provence, where the traveler Jean-Jacques Bouchard wrote of eating it in Toulon in 1630.  Couscous was originally made from millet.  Historians have different opinions as to when wheat began to replace the use of millet. The conversion seems to have occurred sometime in the 20th century, although many regions continue to use the traditional millet. Couscous seems to have a North African origin. Archaeological evidence dating back to the 10th century, consisting of kitchen utensils needed to prepare this dish, has been found in this part of the world.  Ibn Battuta statement of "from it kuskusu and porridge are made"  This quotation contains what may be the earliest mention of couscous (kuskusu) in Western Africa. Ibn Battuta (b. Morocco, AD 1304-1368? ) was the greatest traveler and travel writer of his era. His Rihlah (or Travels) documents a lifetime of travels and employment in every Muslim society, and many non-Muslim societies, in the Eastern hemisphere. He traveled to Western Africa in the early 1350s; his writings of that journey are an important source for modern historians studying medieval Africa.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.

Xenophon was a Greek philosopher, soldier, historian, memoirist, and the author of numerous practical treatises on subjects ranging from horsemanship to taxation.\xa0 While best known in the contemporary philosophical world as the author of a series of sketches of Socrates in conversation, known by their Latin title Memorabilia, Xenophon also wrote a Symposium and an Apology which present a set of vivid and intriguing portraits of Socrates and display some sharp contrasts to the better known portraits in the works of Xenophon’s contemporary, Plato.\xa0 Xenophon’s influence in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in Early Modern intellectual circles was considerable; he was a pioneer in several literary genres including the first-person military memoir (Anabasis) , the biographical novel (Education of Cyrus), and the continued history (Hellenica).\xa0 The range of his areas of expertise and the glancing charm of his down-to-earth writing style continue to fascinate and repay our study. For one example of his work in moral philosophy, he emphasized the importance of self-control, which comprises one of the cardinal virtues of Greek popular morality. This is highlighted by Xenophon in many ways.\xa0 Socrates is often said by Xenophon to have exemplified it in the very highest degree.\xa0 Cyrus displays it when he is invited to look upon the most beautiful woman in Asia, who happens to be his prisoner of war. He firmly declines this temptation; but his general Araspas stares at her endlessly, falls in lust, insults her honor, and ignites a chain of events described by Xenophon that ends in her suicide over her husband’s corpse.  Table of Contents  References and Further Reading  1. Life and Times  Xenophon was born during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, in the outlying deme of Athens called Erchia.\xa0 Located in the fertile plain known as “Mesogeia” (literally “middle earth”) and overlooked by the beautiful mountains Hymettus and Penteli, Erchia was about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the bustling center of Athens–about a three hour walk or one hour brisk horseback ride. \xa0His father Gryllus owned and supervised an estate whose income derived chiefly from farming.\xa0 Thus, Xenophon will have grown up surrounded by a combination of small hold-farming and urban influences. \xa0\xa0Coming of an age in turbulent political times, Xenophon is thought to have been in Athens and personally present at the return of Alcibiades (408), the trial of the Generals, and the overthrow of the 30 Tyrants, all signal events in the rough history of Athenian civic life.  Little else is known about Xenophon’s earliest years.\xa0 From his later writings it can be safely inferred that he received a good basic education and military training as befitted a young member of the Equestrian class, that he was able to ride and hunt extensively, and that in his formative years he observed the careful work needed to keep a modest farm maintained and productive.  In 401. B.C.E at the age of 29, Xenophon was invited by his friend Proxenus to join him on a mercenary military venture to Persia, ostensibly to protect the territory of a minor satrap who was under threat.\xa0 In fact, though this was not known to Xenophon or Proxenus, the campaign was rather more ambitious than that: it was a game of thrones, nothing less than an assault on the claim of the Persian king Artaxerxes II, by his brother Cyrus the Younger.\xa0 The unfolding of this journey into foreign territory, with its adventures and mortal hazards, was a formative event in Xenophon’s life.\xa0 In the very first engagement, Cyrus was himself killed.\xa0 In a peace parley that followed, the generals of the expeditionary force were executed by treachery, leaving the army stranded, leaderless and surrounded by hostile peoples whose languages they did not speak, and winter was coming.\xa0 Xenophon eventually assumed leadership of this stranded and confused army, and led them to safety – as many as survived.\xa0 The book which Xenophon later wrote about their harrowing | Question: Plato and Xenophon were both pupils of which Greek philosopher?', ['socrates'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1764'), ("Context: Robin Gibb: a Bee Gee's secret history - Telegraph.co.ukRobin Gibb: a Bee Gee's secret history - Telegraph  Music  Robin Gibb: a Bee Gee's secret history  Robin Gibb: 'One is a twin for life. I find it incredible that Maurice is no longer alive'\xa0  Olga Craig  12:01AM BST 13 Jul 2008  Robin Gibb, co-creator of the most gloriously shallow pop ever, now wears several deeply serious hats: guardian of British heritage, confidante of world leaders, and 21st century Mozart. He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings. On the first Friday of each month, crowds of locals and visitors head to the First Friday Gallery Hop at Railroad Square, a former lumber yard in downtown Tallahassee that is now home to over 50 eclectic shops, galleries and art studios.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

Scientists have discovered a new species of human, distinct from our own, which lived in caves in China in the Stone Age.  Fossil remains of the mysterious 11,500-year-old people were discovered in south-west China.  Analysis of the find has only now revealed their true significance, opening what scientists have dubbed “the next chapter in the human evolutionary story”.  The bones display an unusual mix of ancient and modern anatomical features, as well as some characteristics not seen before.  Scientists believe they may have belonged to a previously unknown species, distinct from that of modern humans, Homo sapiens.  However, they remain cautious about how to classify the “red deer people” – so called because they hunted extinct red deer.  Lead researcher Professor Darren Curnoe, from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “These new fossils might be of a previously unknown species, one that survived until the very end of the Ice Age around 11,000 years ago.  “Alternatively, they might represent a very early and previously unknown migration of modern humans out of Africa, a population who may not have contributed genetically to living people.”  Controversy still surrounds the discovery of miniature extinct humans dubbed “hobbits” on the Indonesian island of Flores.  The 3ft 6inch creatures, which may have inhabited the island as recently as 12,000 years ago, have been given their own species name, Homo floresiensis.  But some experts insist they were abnormally formed modern humans.  Another puzzle emerged in 2010 with the discovery of a new human species called the Denisovans. Not only were they once widespread across Eurasia, but there is evidence that they interbred with modern humans around 50,000 years ago.  The new research, published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, once again places human evolution in Asia under the spotlight.  Remains of at least three “red deer people” were found at Maludong – the name means “Red Deer Cave” – near the city of Mengzi in Yunnan Province in 1989.  They were left unstudied until research began in 2008 involving scientists from six Chinese and five Australian institutions.  A Chinese geologist discovered a fourth partial skeleton in 1979 in another cave near the village of Longlin, in the neighborring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  It remained encased in a block of rock until its removal by the international team.  Here’s some Red Deer people teeth:  Despite containing more than half the world’s population, scientists still know little about how modern humans evolved there after settling in Eurasia some 70,000 years ago.  Scientific attention on human origins has mostly focused on Europe and Africa.  Until now, the only human fossils less than 100,000 years old found in mainland eastern Asia have resembled those of Homo sapiens.  This suggested the region was devoid of human species until the arrival of modern humans. If the new fossils really do belong to a separate species, it would prove this assumption wrong.  “The discovery of the red deer people opens the next chapter in the human evolutionary story – the Asian chapter – and it’s a story that’s just beginning to be told,” said Prof Curnoe.

The Name of the Church  A church\'s name is meaningful because it conveys important information. From its name, we learn about the identity of believers and how they express their relationship to the divine. A name can also tell us how a church distinguishes itself from other similar faiths. In 1830, as Joseph Smith\'s revelations became scriptures and people warmed to this new testament, it became clear that his fledgling faith community needed a name. Joseph and early Church leaders looked to the Book of Mormon for guidance.  Overview of LDS position  For devout Mormons, the name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints results from divine revelation, from the Word of God as communicated to his chosen prophet, Joseph Smith. The name reinforces the unique and instrumental role Latter-day Saints play in the restoration of the church: "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord\'s kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the Second Coming of the Messiah." [1]  For members, the Church\'s name signifies the community\'s special responsibility, and it designates the crucial role every member, or saint, has in bringing about God\'s kingdom. Name alterations occurring in its early years indicate Church leaders\' inspired efforts to transmit the intentions of God in human language.  Overview of Critics\' position  The historical record shows that the Church\'s name has been significantly altered. In 1830, it was first named, "Church of Christ," in 1834, the name changed to "The Church of the Latter Day Saints," and in 1838, the name changed again, to "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Working with the contemporary primary sources, historians have noted a lack of clarity concerning the reason for these name changes. There is also scant reliable information documenting the decision-making processes followed by early Church leaders. One fact that appears indisputable is that name changes resulted from human, not divine, intervention. For critics, these alterations are from the acts and intentions of humans motivated by perhaps social, political, and economic objectives.  References  "Introduction," Book of Mormon. Link is here.  Contents for this page  Links  Member beliefs  We, as Latter-day Saints, often cite the name of the church as an indication that the LDS Church is truly God\'s one, true church. We often say things like the Lutheran Church can\'t be God\'s church because it is named after a man, Martin Luther. The word \'Catholic\' just means universal. Baptists are said to be named after John the Baptist. The true church must be named after Christ, thus the official name "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints". The Latter-day part added to show that it is not the original church that Christ established around 30 AD, but rather Christ\'s restored church in this dispensation.  The Book of Mormon says that the true church must have the name of Christ in it. 3 Nephi 27:8 reads:  "And how be it my church save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses\' name then it be Moses\' church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel." 3 Nephi 27:8  According to the Book of Mormon, Jesus Christ revealed the name of his church to the Nephite people: the " church of Christ".  "And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus were called the church of Christ." ( 3 Nephi 26:21 , bold added)  "And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations | Question: What is an alternative name for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?', ['mormon'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3355'), ('Context: From the 16th to the early 20th century , the structure of the rosary remained essentially unchanged .

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head. | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk  STAGE AND SCREEN  Why did Shakespeare make Julius Caesar\'s last words the Latin \'Et tu, Brute?\' when Suetonius tells us they were the Greek \'Kai su, teknon?\' (You too, my son?)? Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head.  THE answer is simple. The ancient historians such as Suetonius and Plutarch were as much in the entertainment business as the great playwright. Phrases like Suetonius\'s \'Kai su, teknon\' and Plutarch\'s dramatic descriptions, were as much for the enjoyment of the reader/listener as for the true recording of fact. Shakespeare simply used the line \'Et tu Brute\' because it suited his dramatic purpose, just as Plutarch and Suetonius had used what suited them. Personally, I suspect Julius Caesar\'s last words were \'aaaaaaaaaaah\'.  Jonathan Munn, Whitchurch, Cardiff.  I THINK it\'s generally accepted that Caesar\'s dying words were the Greek \'Kai su, teknon\'. Romans of his class moved easily between Latin and Greek. But it\'s important to recognise that he was not asking \'You too, my son?\' The words \'Kai su\' - found in Greek comedy and on mosaics - mean \'Screw you!\' and the \'teknon\' (\'kid\') just makes it fiercer.  Greg Rowe, The Queen\'s College, Oxford.  I MUST point out that Shakespeare does not make Caesar\'s last words \'Et tu, Brute?\' Shakespeare gives him another three words after the famous quotation: \'Then fall Caesar!\'  Eric Standidge, London SE10.  As we all know, the old Greek language doesn\'t have anything to do with a modern Greek language and no Greeks can understand the old one. The only people who do understand it are Albanians. The etymology of the word KAI SU TEKNON (Kai s\'u te knon)means Cry like you are singing. Kai -Cray SU- like you Te`knon- singing Shakespeare was in Albania a few times and he maybe understood the Albanian language.  Lamun Dardanian, Kosova Albania  It expresses a meaning that cannot be made in English - using tu implies a closeness, such as brother.  p martin, nuneaton uk  Kai su, teknon means "Even you, son!" Shakespeare put in Latin because more of his audience knew Latin than Greek. Putting the phrase in another language corresponds to what Caesar himself said.

The Quotation in Context  Caesar and his train approach the Senate. He sees the soothsayer in the crowd and confidently declares, "The ides of March are come" (1). "Ay, Caesar; but not gone" (2), replies the soothsayer. Artemidorus is also on the street and he pleads with Caesar to read his scroll. But Caesar ignores him and enters the Senate. Cassius approaches him with a request to overturn a previous ruling and let a banished countrymen return home. Caesar answers with a flavoured speech, informing Cassius that "I was constant Cimber should be banish\'d/And constant do remain to keep him so" (72-3).  The conspirators gather around Caesar and he sees his trusted friend Brutus among them. They pull out their swords and stab Caesar. With his dying breath Caesar addresses Brutus, "Et tu, Brute?

For example , Biskra , Algeria and Ouarzazate , Morocco are found in this zone .

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.  Queen Anne's Signature  Quotes:  �She meant well and was not a fool; but nobody can maintain that she was wise, nor entertaining in conversation� � Sarah Churchill (about Queen Anne)  �Queen Anne was the quintessence of ordinariness; she also had more than her fair share of small-mindedness, vulgarity and downright meanness� � Historian J.P.

Scientists have discovered a new species of human, distinct from our own, which lived in caves in China in the Stone Age.  Fossil remains of the mysterious 11,500-year-old people were discovered in south-west China.  Analysis of the find has only now revealed their true significance, opening what scientists have dubbed “the next chapter in the human evolutionary story”.  The bones display an unusual mix of ancient and modern anatomical features, as well as some characteristics not seen before.  Scientists believe they may have belonged to a previously unknown species, distinct from that of modern humans, Homo sapiens.  However, they remain cautious about how to classify the “red deer people” – so called because they hunted extinct red deer.  Lead researcher Professor Darren Curnoe, from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “These new fossils might be of a previously unknown species, one that survived until the very end of the Ice Age around 11,000 years ago.  “Alternatively, they might represent a very early and previously unknown migration of modern humans out of Africa, a population who may not have contributed genetically to living people.”  Controversy still surrounds the discovery of miniature extinct humans dubbed “hobbits” on the Indonesian island of Flores.  The 3ft 6inch creatures, which may have inhabited the island as recently as 12,000 years ago, have been given their own species name, Homo floresiensis.  But some experts insist they were abnormally formed modern humans.  Another puzzle emerged in 2010 with the discovery of a new human species called the Denisovans. Not only were they once widespread across Eurasia, but there is evidence that they interbred with modern humans around 50,000 years ago.  The new research, published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, once again places human evolution in Asia under the spotlight.  Remains of at least three “red deer people” were found at Maludong – the name means “Red Deer Cave” – near the city of Mengzi in Yunnan Province in 1989.  They were left unstudied until research began in 2008 involving scientists from six Chinese and five Australian institutions.  A Chinese geologist discovered a fourth partial skeleton in 1979 in another cave near the village of Longlin, in the neighborring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  It remained encased in a block of rock until its removal by the international team.  Here’s some Red Deer people teeth:  Despite containing more than half the world’s population, scientists still know little about how modern humans evolved there after settling in Eurasia some 70,000 years ago.  Scientific attention on human origins has mostly focused on Europe and Africa.  Until now, the only human fossils less than 100,000 years old found in mainland eastern Asia have resembled those of Homo sapiens.  This suggested the region was devoid of human species until the arrival of modern humans. If the new fossils really do belong to a separate species, it would prove this assumption wrong.  “The discovery of the red deer people opens the next chapter in the human evolutionary story – the Asian chapter – and it’s a story that’s just beginning to be told,” said Prof Curnoe.

The Name of the Church  A church\'s name is meaningful because it conveys important information. From its name, we learn about the identity of believers and how they express their relationship to the divine. A name can also tell us how a church distinguishes itself from other similar faiths. In 1830, as Joseph Smith\'s revelations became scriptures and people warmed to this new testament, it became clear that his fledgling faith community needed a name. Joseph and early Church leaders looked to the Book of Mormon for guidance.  Overview of LDS position  For devout Mormons, the name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints results from divine revelation, from the Word of God as communicated to his chosen prophet, Joseph Smith. The name reinforces the unique and instrumental role Latter-day Saints play in the restoration of the church: "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord\'s kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the Second Coming of the Messiah." [1]  For members, the Church\'s name signifies the community\'s special responsibility, and it designates the crucial role every member, or saint, has in bringing about God\'s kingdom. Name alterations occurring in its early years indicate Church leaders\' inspired efforts to transmit the intentions of God in human language.  Overview of Critics\' position  The historical record shows that the Church\'s name has been significantly altered. In 1830, it was first named, "Church of Christ," in 1834, the name changed to "The Church of the Latter Day Saints," and in 1838, the name changed again, to "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Working with the contemporary primary sources, historians have noted a lack of clarity concerning the reason for these name changes. There is also scant reliable information documenting the decision-making processes followed by early Church leaders. One fact that appears indisputable is that name changes resulted from human, not divine, intervention. For critics, these alterations are from the acts and intentions of humans motivated by perhaps social, political, and economic objectives.  References  "Introduction," Book of Mormon. Link is here.  Contents for this page  Links  Member beliefs  We, as Latter-day Saints, often cite the name of the church as an indication that the LDS Church is truly God\'s one, true church. We often say things like the Lutheran Church can\'t be God\'s church because it is named after a man, Martin Luther. The word \'Catholic\' just means universal. Baptists are said to be named after John the Baptist. The true church must be named after Christ, thus the official name "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints". The Latter-day part added to show that it is not the original church that Christ established around 30 AD, but rather Christ\'s restored church in this dispensation.  The Book of Mormon says that the true church must have the name of Christ in it. 3 Nephi 27:8 reads:  "And how be it my church save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses\' name then it be Moses\' church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel." 3 Nephi 27:8  According to the Book of Mormon, Jesus Christ revealed the name of his church to the Nephite people: the " church of Christ".  "And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus were called the church of Christ."

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4.

Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head. | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk  STAGE AND SCREEN  Why did Shakespeare make Julius Caesar\'s last words the Latin \'Et tu, Brute?\' when Suetonius tells us they were the Greek \'Kai su, teknon?\' (You too, my son?)? Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head.  THE answer is simple. The ancient historians such as Suetonius and Plutarch were as much in the entertainment business as the great playwright. Phrases like Suetonius\'s \'Kai su, teknon\' and Plutarch\'s dramatic descriptions, were as much for the enjoyment of the reader/listener as for the true recording of fact. Shakespeare simply used the line \'Et tu Brute\' because it suited his dramatic purpose, just as Plutarch and Suetonius had used what suited them. Personally, I suspect Julius Caesar\'s last words were \'aaaaaaaaaaah\'.  Jonathan Munn, Whitchurch, Cardiff.  I THINK it\'s generally accepted that Caesar\'s dying words were the Greek \'Kai su, teknon\'. Romans of his class moved easily between Latin and Greek. But it\'s important to recognise that he was not asking \'You too, my son?\' The words \'Kai su\' - found in Greek comedy and on mosaics - mean \'Screw you!\' and the \'teknon\' (\'kid\') just makes it fiercer.  Greg Rowe, The Queen\'s College, Oxford.  I MUST point out that Shakespeare does not make Caesar\'s last words \'Et tu, Brute?\' Shakespeare gives him another three words after the famous quotation: \'Then fall Caesar!\'  Eric Standidge, London SE10.  As we all know, the old Greek language doesn\'t have anything to do with a modern Greek language and no Greeks can understand the old one. The only people who do understand it are Albanians. The etymology of the word KAI SU TEKNON (Kai s\'u te knon)means Cry like you are singing. Kai -Cray SU- like you Te`knon- singing Shakespeare was in Albania a few times and he maybe understood the Albanian language.  Lamun Dardanian, Kosova Albania  It expresses a meaning that cannot be made in English - using tu implies a closeness, such as brother.  p martin, nuneaton uk  Kai su, teknon means "Even you, son!" Shakespeare put in Latin because more of his audience knew Latin than Greek. Putting the phrase in another language corresponds to what Caesar himself said.  Mark, Henderson USA  All About Shakespeare\'s "Et, tu, Brute"All About Shakespeare\'s "Et, tu, Brute"  Et tu, Brute? (Julius Caesar, 3.1.77)  i.e., You too, Brutus?  The Quotation in Context  Caesar and his train approach the Senate. He sees the soothsayer in the crowd and confidently declares, "The ides of March are come" (1). "Ay, Caesar; but not gone" (2), replies the soothsayer. Artemidorus is also on the street and he pleads with Caesar to read his scroll. But Caesar ignores him and enters the Senate.

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.  Queen Anne's Signature  Quotes:  �She meant well and was not a fool; but nobody can maintain that she was wise, nor entertaining in conversation� � Sarah Churchill (about Queen Anne)  �Queen Anne was the quintessence of ordinariness; she also had more than her fair share of small-mindedness, vulgarity and downright meanness� � Historian J.P.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb. Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films.

In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.  The west consists largely of poor subsoils and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket bog, whereas the east is largely a limestone landscape.  Agricultural land is therefore more productive in the east than in the west.  *The highest point in Mayo (and Connacht) is Mweelrea, at 814 m  *The River Moy in the northeast of the county is renowned for its salmon fishing  *Ireland\'s largest island, Achill Island, lies off Mayo\'s west coast  *Mayo has Ireland\'s highest cliffs at Croaghaun, Achill Island,  while the Benwee Head cliffs in Kilcommon Erris drop almost perpendicularly 900 ft into the Atlantic Ocean.   )  *The northwest areas of County Mayo have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, if not the world, in terms of wind resources, ocean wave, tidal and hydroelectric resources     Local government and political subdivisions  Mayo County Council () is the authority responsible for local government.

Evidence has been dug up that this root plant originated in Afghanistan. Over the centuries traders traveling through the region picked up carrot seeds there and carried them along the trade routes of Arabia, Africa, and Asia, selling them in regions anxious to cultivate new and productive plants. Even in the early days there were many varieties of carrots, coming in an assortment of colors - purple, white, black, and red but, surprisingly, not orange!  Carrots spread over the civilized world and have even been found in Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh\'s tombs. Drawings found in Egyptian temples are thought by Egyptologists to be a purple variety of carrots 1 .  Both the ancient Greeks and the Romans were familiar with carrots, although these early varieties were not the sweet, succulent orange carrots that are grown today. Early carrots were typically not often eaten as food by the Greeks, but were used for medicinal purposes. The Romans were known to have eaten both raw and cooked carrots accompanied with an olive oil dressing containing different herbs. Like many other plants, at various times in ancient societies, carrots were thought to be an aphrodisiac.  Carrots began to be cultivated in Europe by the 13th century (1200s), with many doctors prescribing carrots for medicinal purposes for ailments as varied as syphilis and animal bites! The Medieval Europeans were very much in awe of the ancients and inclined to borrow heavily from them.  Carrots were well-known to 16th century botanists and writers, who described red and purple varieties in France, and yellow and red varieties in England. The Dutch cross-bred the yellow and red carrot to produce a variety that was the emblematic color of the House of Orange. This carrot quickly became popular and was further developed to become the sweet, succulent orange carrot which is the most recognized color of carrot used throughout the world today 2 .  Carrots arrived in Australia in 1788 and became an important food for the colonists. The Carrot Museum reveals that the carrot was introduced to America in 1609. In 1871 America developed its first carrot. It is called the Danvers carrot from its origins in Danvers, MA. However, the carrot did not become popular in the U.S. until after World War I (1914-1918) when "doughboys" returning from the war had been exposed to the carrot in French and other European cuisine. 3  In the Second World War carrots were promoted by the British government and became one of the staple foods in England. People were encouraged grow carrots in their gardens and to cook them in different ways. They were incorporated into both sweet and savory dishes. Growing this crop during troubled times helped people get sufficient amounts of nutritious food to eat in times of food scarcity and rationing.  Red and yellow varieties of carrot are eaten in China and Japan; with the purple carrot becoming increasingly popular in different states in America. There are also \'rainbow\' carrots on the market. However, a single carrot is not multi-colored, the name comes from bags containing red, yellow, purple and orange carrots.

Carrots were also probably White throughout these periods,      often confused with Parsnips (also white).      There was (and still is!) enormous confusion when trying to sort out the individual histories of carrots and parsnips. The Latin name      for the parsnip genus is      thought to come from,      meaning "food". This would further explain the historical confusion of the      two vegetables, as well as offer a testament to how important they both were in      the ancient diet.

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings. On the first Friday of each month, crowds of locals and visitors head to the First Friday Gallery Hop at Railroad Square, a former lumber yard in downtown Tallahassee that is now home to over 50 eclectic shops, galleries and art studios.

It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic (the Lancashire Loom).  The power loom reduced demand for skilled handweavers, initially causing reduced wages and unemployment. Protests followed its introduction. For example, in 1816 two thousand rioting Calton weavers tried to destroy power loom mills, and stoned the workers.  A darker side of the power loom’s impact was the growth of employment of children in power loom mills.  Relation to Textiles:  Much like the water frame did for spinning, the power loom started automating the process of weaving, though it was a long time until the power loom was fully automatic.  Cartwright’s initial version of the loom was not very commercially successful, but by the 1850s, there were a quarter of a million looms operating in the UK, compared to the 240 that were operating in 1803.  Of course, the power loom, like many of the innovations in weaving, caused a number of riots, and several machines were smashed by workers; eventually, however, the growth in weaving caused a growth in exports and thus a growth in industrial employment, albeit lower-paid employment.  ‹  Power loom | RanklyPower loom | Rankly  Power loom  Ranked #20 on the list Best Invention of All Time  7.20  Inventor:  Patents:  A power loom is a mechanised loom powered by a line shaft. The first power loom was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785. It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic. This was known as the Lancashire Loom. By 1850 there were 260,000 in operation in England. Fifty years later came the Northrop Loom that would replenish the shuttle when it was empty and this replaced the Lancashire loom. The major components of the loom are the warp beam, heddles, harnesses, shuttle, reed and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. With each weaving operation, the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.

The term power loom, corresponds to a mechanized loom powered by a driveshaft . The first power loom was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785, later to be perfected by William Horrocks. It allowed textile making to be done far faster than if a human had done the same work. By 1850, over 250,000 of Cartwright\'s designs were used in England. James Henry Northrop invented the automatic "weft replenishment" loom. It revolutionized the weaving industry. Some 700,000 "Northrop" automatic looms were sold worldwide .  Originally, power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across, but in the early part of the 20th century the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximize production for specific types of material. The most common of these are air-jet looms and water-jet looms.

In this painting the couple belongs to the latter group.  Their yard has become a field that is in the process of being overrun by locust trees, and the couple huddles near a grand house that seems alien to them—a house that belongs to another era and bespeaks a refinement that is inconsistent with their work-worn appearance.  Hopper\'s great culminating picture of Cape Cod in the 1930s is Cape Cod Evening (1939). In the ledger book, Jo [Hopper\'s wife] notes:  Cape Cod Evening—finished July 30, 1939.  Note design on glass door and house. Young man... good looking Swede. Was to have been called "Whipporwill" [sic] Dog hears it.... Woman a Finn & dour. Trees in phalanx position, creeping up on one with the dar[k]. The Whipporwill [sic] is there out of sight. Painted in S. Truro Studio. (Vol. II)  Lloyd Goodrich has quoted Hopper\'s own account of the painting:  It is no exact transcription of a place, but pieced together from sketches and mental impressions of things in the vicinity. The grove of locust trees was done from sketches nearby. The doorway of the house comes from Orleans about twenty miles from here.  The figures were done almost entirely without models, and the dry, blowing grass can be seen from my studio window in the late summer or autumn. In the woman I attempted to get the broad, strong-jawed face and blond hair of a Finnish type of which there are many on the Cape. The man is a dark-haired Yankee. The dog is listening to something, probably a whippoorwill or some evening sound.  Several aspects of both descriptions need to be elaborated on: (1) the scene is late summer or autumn, (2) the couple is of immigrant stock or a mixture of immigrant (the man who may be Swedish and the woman who is definitely Finnish) and local (the man whom Edward Hopper refers to as "Yankee"), (3) the dog responds to the sound of the whippoorwill outside the painting, and (4) nature is once again taking over: the trees are regarded as a phalanx, and night is approaching.  Cape Cod Evening is concerned with the loss of a viable rural America: it focuses on those people and places that have been left in the wake of progress. Today it is rarely remembered how enormous were the differences between the rural and urban population in the late 1930s. At that time three out of every four farms were lit by kerosene lamps, a quarter of the rural homes lacked running water, and a third were without flush toilets. Cape Cod Evening was created the same year as the New York World\'s Fair, which was entitled The World of Tomorrow. The fair featured a robot called Elektro, which could talk and smoke, and an exhibit organized by GM entitled Futurama. Designed by Norman Bel Geddes, the GM exhibition drew twenty-eight thousand paying customers a day who sat on a conveyor belt armchair for fifteen minutes and listened to a recorded voice explaining what the American landscape would be like in 1960. To a generation that had been burdened by the Depression, Bel Geddes\'s predictions were less important for their accurate forecasting than for the fact that he was offering people an opportunity to begin thinking optimistically about the future.  In Cape Cod Evening Hopper creates a complete contrast to The World of Tomorrow by picturing a future that is retrograde. He shows how nature is reclaiming land, which less than a century before had been domesticated into the site of an imposing Victorian house with its attendant garden. Although the collie in the preliminary drawing for this painting is turned toward the couple, in the completed painting it directs its attention to the sound of the whippoorwill, which symbolizes the power of nature over culture.

On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.  While working as Johnny Carson\'s sidekick during The Tonight Show, McMahon served as the president of the national alumni association from | Question: Yesterday saw the passing of Ed McMahon.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Scientists have discovered a new species of human, distinct from our own, which lived in caves in China in the Stone Age.  Fossil remains of the mysterious 11,500-year-old people were discovered in south-west China.  Analysis of the find has only now revealed their true significance, opening what scientists have dubbed “the next chapter in the human evolutionary story”.  The bones display an unusual mix of ancient and modern anatomical features, as well as some characteristics not seen before.  Scientists believe they may have belonged to a previously unknown species, distinct from that of modern humans, Homo sapiens.  However, they remain cautious about how to classify the “red deer people” – so called because they hunted extinct red deer.  Lead researcher Professor Darren Curnoe, from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “These new fossils might be of a previously unknown species, one that survived until the very end of the Ice Age around 11,000 years ago.  “Alternatively, they might represent a very early and previously unknown migration of modern humans out of Africa, a population who may not have contributed genetically to living people.”  Controversy still surrounds the discovery of miniature extinct humans dubbed “hobbits” on the Indonesian island of Flores.  The 3ft 6inch creatures, which may have inhabited the island as recently as 12,000 years ago, have been given their own species name, Homo floresiensis.  But some experts insist they were abnormally formed modern humans.  Another puzzle emerged in 2010 with the discovery of a new human species called the Denisovans. Not only were they once widespread across Eurasia, but there is evidence that they interbred with modern humans around 50,000 years ago.  The new research, published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, once again places human evolution in Asia under the spotlight.  Remains of at least three “red deer people” were found at Maludong – the name means “Red Deer Cave” – near the city of Mengzi in Yunnan Province in 1989.  They were left unstudied until research began in 2008 involving scientists from six Chinese and five Australian institutions.  A Chinese geologist discovered a fourth partial skeleton in 1979 in another cave near the village of Longlin, in the neighborring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  It remained encased in a block of rock until its removal by the international team.  Here’s some Red Deer people teeth:  Despite containing more than half the world’s population, scientists still know little about how modern humans evolved there after settling in Eurasia some 70,000 years ago.  Scientific attention on human origins has mostly focused on Europe and Africa.  Until now, the only human fossils less than 100,000 years old found in mainland eastern Asia have resembled those of Homo sapiens.  This suggested the region was devoid of human species until the arrival of modern humans. If the new fossils really do belong to a separate species, it would prove this assumption wrong.  “The discovery of the red deer people opens the next chapter in the human evolutionary story – the Asian chapter – and it’s a story that’s just beginning to be told,” said Prof Curnoe.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it. After Bond kills Tee Hee, he rescues her out of the bed and they soon make out.

People once believed that mushrooms growing in a circle followed the path made by fairies dancing in a ring. Fairy rings are found in open grassy places and in forests.  In grass, the best known fairy ring fungus has the scientific name Marasmius oreades. The body of this fungus, its mycelium, is underground. It grows outward in a circle. As it grows, the mycelium uses up all of the nutrients in the soil, starving the grass. This is the reason a fairy ring has dead grass over the growing edge of the mycelium. Umbrella-shaped fruiting bodies, called mushrooms, spring up from just behind the outer edge of the mycelium.  Large rings are created when the older mycelium in the center finally exhausts the soil nutrients and dies. On the death of the central mycelium, the nutrients are returned to the soil and grass can grow again.  The living edge of the mycelium continues to grow outward. As it grows, it secretes chemicals into the ground ahead. These chemicals break down the organic matter, releasing nutrients so that the mycelium will  have food when it reaches this area. For a brief time, the grass at the outer edge of the ring also benefits. The extra nutrients make the grass darker green, taller, and thicker than the rest of the lawn or pasture. This lush grass dies when the mycelium grows under it and steals the nutrients.  Fairy rings made by fungi like Marasmius oreades are called "free" rings. They will continue to grow outward until a barrier is reached. Sometimes the barrier is another fairy ring! Rings can grow into each other\'s territory and die as each reaches the other\'s "dead zone."  If there are no barriers, free rings can grow outward at up to 8 inches (20 cm) per year. They can reach a diameter of over 30 feet (10 m). One ring formed in France by the fungus Clitocybe geotropa is almost a half mile (600 m) in diameter. This ring is thought to be 700 years old.  Mycorrhizal fungi, which live in symbiotic partnership with trees, also form fairy rings. Their rings are called "tethered" rings. A tether is like a leash. The fungus and its mycorrhizal partner tree need each other to survive. The mycelium of these fungi always remains joined to the tree\'s roots. Roots are the "tether" that keeps the fairy rings of mycorrhizal fungi from growing too far from their tree.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.  The west consists largely of poor subsoils and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket bog, whereas the east is largely a limestone landscape.  Agricultural land is therefore more productive in the east than in the west.  *The highest point in Mayo (and Connacht) is Mweelrea, at 814 m  *The River Moy in the northeast of the county is renowned for its salmon fishing  *Ireland\'s largest island, Achill Island, lies off Mayo\'s west coast  *Mayo has Ireland\'s highest cliffs at Croaghaun, Achill Island,  while the Benwee Head cliffs in Kilcommon Erris drop almost perpendicularly 900 ft into the Atlantic Ocean.   )  *The northwest areas of County Mayo have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, if not the world, in terms of wind resources, ocean wave, tidal and hydroelectric resources     Local government and political subdivisions  Mayo County Council () is the authority responsible for local government.  As a county council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001.

Evidence has been dug up that this root plant originated in Afghanistan. Over the centuries traders traveling through the region picked up carrot seeds there and carried them along the trade routes of Arabia, Africa, and Asia, selling them in regions anxious to cultivate new and productive plants. Even in the early days there were many varieties of carrots, coming in an assortment of colors - purple, white, black, and red but, surprisingly, not orange!  Carrots spread over the civilized world and have even been found in Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh\'s tombs. Drawings found in Egyptian temples are thought by Egyptologists to be a purple variety of carrots 1 .  Both the ancient Greeks and the Romans were familiar with carrots, although these early varieties were not the sweet, succulent orange carrots that are grown today. Early carrots were typically not often eaten as food by the Greeks, but were used for medicinal purposes. The Romans were known to have eaten both raw and cooked carrots accompanied with an olive oil dressing containing different herbs. Like many other plants, at various times in ancient societies, carrots were thought to be an aphrodisiac.  Carrots began to be cultivated in Europe by the 13th century (1200s), with many doctors prescribing carrots for medicinal purposes for ailments as varied as syphilis and animal bites! The Medieval Europeans were very much in awe of the ancients and inclined to borrow heavily from them.  Carrots were well-known to 16th century botanists and writers, who described red and purple varieties in France, and yellow and red varieties in England. The Dutch cross-bred the yellow and red carrot to produce a variety that was the emblematic color of the House of Orange. This carrot quickly became popular and was further developed to become the sweet, succulent orange carrot which is the most recognized color of carrot used throughout the world today 2 .  Carrots arrived in Australia in 1788 and became an important food for the colonists. The Carrot Museum reveals that the carrot was introduced to America in 1609. In 1871 America developed its first carrot. It is called the Danvers carrot from its origins in Danvers, MA. However, the carrot did not become popular in the U.S. until after World War I (1914-1918) when "doughboys" returning from the war had been exposed to the carrot in French and other European cuisine. 3  In the Second World War carrots were promoted by the British government and became one of the staple foods in England. People were encouraged grow carrots in their gardens and to cook them in different ways. They were incorporated into both sweet and savory dishes. Growing this crop during troubled times helped people get sufficient amounts of nutritious food to eat in times of food scarcity and rationing.  Red and yellow varieties of carrot are eaten in China and Japan; with the purple carrot becoming increasingly popular in different states in America. There are also \'rainbow\' carrots on the market. However, a single carrot is not multi-colored, the name comes from bags containing red, yellow, purple and orange carrots.

Carrots were also probably White throughout these periods,      often confused with Parsnips (also white).      There was (and still is!) enormous confusion when trying to sort out the individual histories of carrots and parsnips. The Latin name      for the parsnip genus is      thought to come from,      meaning "food". This would further explain the historical confusion of the      two vegetables, as well as offer a testament to how important they both were in      the ancient diet.

Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts.

It was refined over the next 47 years until a design by Kenworthy and Bullough made the operation completely automatic (the Lancashire Loom).  The power loom reduced demand for skilled handweavers, initially causing reduced wages and unemployment. Protests followed its introduction. For example, in 1816 two thousand rioting Calton weavers tried to destroy power loom mills, and stoned the workers.  A darker side of the power loom’s impact was the growth of employment of children in power loom mills.  Relation to Textiles:  Much like the water frame did for spinning, the power loom started automating the process of weaving, though it was a long time until the power loom was fully automatic.  Cartwright’s initial version of the loom was not very commercially successful, but by the 1850s, there were a quarter of a million looms operating in the UK, compared to the 240 that were operating in 1803.  Of course, the power loom, like many of the innovations in weaving, caused a number of riots, and several machines were smashed by workers; eventually, however, the growth in weaving caused a growth in exports and thus a growth in industrial employment, albeit lower-paid employment.  ‹  Power loom | RanklyPower loom | Rankly  Power loom  Ranked #20 on the list Best Invention of All Time  7.20  Inventor:  Patents:  A power loom is a mechanised loom powered by a line shaft.

The major components of the loom are the warp beam, heddles, harnesses, shuttle, reed and takeup roll. In the loom, yarn processing includes shedding, picking, battening and taking-up operations. With each weaving operation, the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or released from the warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.

James Henry Northrop invented the automatic "weft replenishment" loom. It revolutionized the weaving industry. Some 700,000 "Northrop" automatic looms were sold worldwide .  Originally, power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across, but in the early part of the 20th century the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximize production for specific types of material. The most common of these are air-jet looms and water-jet looms. Computer-driven looms are now also available to individual home weavers. ja:織機#力織機  How did Edmund Cartwright\'s power loom work? | Reference.comHow did Edmund Cartwright\'s power loom work? | Reference.com  How did Edmund Cartwright\'s power loom work? | Question: In 1784, who designed the first power loom?', ['edmund cartwright'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-938'), ("Context: In philosophy , economics , and political science , the common good ( also commonwealth , common weal or general welfare ) refers to either what is shared and beneficial for all or most members of a given community , or alternatively , what is achieved by citizenship , collective action , and active participation in the realm of politics and public service . The concept of the common good differs significantly among philosophical doctrines . Early conceptions of the common good were set out by Ancient Greek philosophers , including Aristotle and Plato . One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle 's philosophy remains in common usage today , referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the `` good proper to , and attainable only by , the community , yet individually shared by its members . '' The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists , moral philosophers , and public economists , including Thomas Aquinas , Niccolò Machiavelli , John Locke , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , James Madison , Adam Smith , Karl Marx , John Stuart Mill , John Rawls , and many other thinkers . In contemporary economic theory , a common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable , while the common good , by contrast , arises in the subfield of welfare economics and refers to the outcome of a social welfare function . Such a social welfare function , in turn , would be rooted in a moral theory of the good ( such as utilitarianism ) .

In this painting the couple belongs to the latter group.  Their yard has become a field that is in the process of being overrun by locust trees, and the couple huddles near a grand house that seems alien to them—a house that belongs to another era and bespeaks a refinement that is inconsistent with their work-worn appearance.  Hopper\'s great culminating picture of Cape Cod in the 1930s is Cape Cod Evening (1939). In the ledger book, Jo [Hopper\'s wife] notes:  Cape Cod Evening—finished July 30, 1939.  Note design on glass door and house. Young man... good looking Swede. Was to have been called "Whipporwill" [sic] Dog hears it.... Woman a Finn & dour. Trees in phalanx position, creeping up on one with the dar[k]. The Whipporwill [sic] is there out of sight. Painted in S. Truro Studio. (Vol. II)  Lloyd Goodrich has quoted Hopper\'s own account of the painting:  It is no exact transcription of a place, but pieced together from sketches and mental impressions of things in the vicinity. The grove of locust trees was done from sketches nearby. The doorway of the house comes from Orleans about twenty miles from here.  The figures were done almost entirely without models, and the dry, blowing grass can be seen from my studio window in the late summer or autumn. In the woman I attempted to get the broad, strong-jawed face and blond hair of a Finnish type of which there are many on the Cape. The man is a dark-haired Yankee. The dog is listening to something, probably a whippoorwill or some evening sound.  Several aspects of both descriptions need to be elaborated on: (1) the scene is late summer or autumn, (2) the couple is of immigrant stock or a mixture of immigrant (the man who may be Swedish and the woman who is definitely Finnish) and local (the man whom Edward Hopper refers to as "Yankee"), (3) the dog responds to the sound of the whippoorwill outside the painting, and (4) nature is once again taking over: the trees are regarded as a phalanx, and night is approaching.  Cape Cod Evening is concerned with the loss of a viable rural America: it focuses on those people and places that have been left in the wake of progress. Today it is rarely remembered how enormous were the differences between the rural and urban population in the late 1930s. At that time three out of every four farms were lit by kerosene lamps, a quarter of the rural homes lacked running water, and a third were without flush toilets. Cape Cod Evening was created the same year as the New York World\'s Fair, which was entitled The World of Tomorrow. The fair featured a robot called Elektro, which could talk and smoke, and an exhibit organized by GM entitled Futurama. Designed by Norman Bel Geddes, the GM exhibition drew twenty-eight thousand paying customers a day who sat on a conveyor belt armchair for fifteen minutes and listened to a recorded voice explaining what the American landscape would be like in 1960. To a generation that had been burdened by the Depression, Bel Geddes\'s predictions were less important for their accurate forecasting than for the fact that he was offering people an opportunity to begin thinking optimistically about the future.  In Cape Cod Evening Hopper creates a complete contrast to The World of Tomorrow by picturing a future that is retrograde. He shows how nature is reclaiming land, which less than a century before had been domesticated into the site of an imposing Victorian house with its attendant garden. Although the collie in the preliminary drawing for this painting is turned toward the couple, in the completed painting it directs its attention to the sound of the whippoorwill, which symbolizes the power of nature over culture.

He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.

In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai).

It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything."

Scientists have discovered a new species of human, distinct from our own, which lived in caves in China in the Stone Age.  Fossil remains of the mysterious 11,500-year-old people were discovered in south-west China.  Analysis of the find has only now revealed their true significance, opening what scientists have dubbed “the next chapter in the human evolutionary story”.  The bones display an unusual mix of ancient and modern anatomical features, as well as some characteristics not seen before.  Scientists believe they may have belonged to a previously unknown species, distinct from that of modern humans, Homo sapiens.  However, they remain cautious about how to classify the “red deer people” – so called because they hunted extinct red deer.  Lead researcher Professor Darren Curnoe, from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “These new fossils might be of a previously unknown species, one that survived until the very end of the Ice Age around 11,000 years ago.  “Alternatively, they might represent a very early and previously unknown migration of modern humans out of Africa, a population who may not have contributed genetically to living people.”  Controversy still surrounds the discovery of miniature extinct humans dubbed “hobbits” on the Indonesian island of Flores.  The 3ft 6inch creatures, which may have inhabited the island as recently as 12,000 years ago, have been given their own species name, Homo floresiensis.  But some experts insist they were abnormally formed modern humans.  Another puzzle emerged in 2010 with the discovery of a new human species called the Denisovans. Not only were they once widespread across Eurasia, but there is evidence that they interbred with modern humans around 50,000 years ago.  The new research, published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, once again places human evolution in Asia under the spotlight.  Remains of at least three “red deer people” were found at Maludong – the name means “Red Deer Cave” – near the city of Mengzi in Yunnan Province in 1989.  They were left unstudied until research began in 2008 involving scientists from six Chinese and five Australian institutions.  A Chinese geologist discovered a fourth partial skeleton in 1979 in another cave near the village of Longlin, in the neighborring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  It remained encased in a block of rock until its removal by the international team.  Here’s some Red Deer people teeth:  Despite containing more than half the world’s population, scientists still know little about how modern humans evolved there after settling in Eurasia some 70,000 years ago.  Scientific attention on human origins has mostly focused on Europe and Africa.  Until now, the only human fossils less than 100,000 years old found in mainland eastern Asia have resembled those of Homo sapiens.  This suggested the region was devoid of human species until the arrival of modern humans. If the new fossils really do belong to a separate species, it would prove this assumption wrong.  “The discovery of the red deer people opens the next chapter in the human evolutionary story – the Asian chapter – and it’s a story that’s just beginning to be told,” said Prof Curnoe.

This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

See More  Solitaire (Jane Seymour) - James Bond Wiki - WikiaSolitaire (Jane Seymour) | James Bond Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Solitaire is a fictional character in the James Bond novel and film Live and Let Die . In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it. After Bond kills Tee Hee, he rescues her out of the bed and they soon make out.

People once believed that mushrooms growing in a circle followed the path made by fairies dancing in a ring. Fairy rings are found in open grassy places and in forests.  In grass, the best known fairy ring fungus has the scientific name Marasmius oreades. The body of this fungus, its mycelium, is underground. It grows outward in a circle. As it grows, the mycelium uses up all of the nutrients in the soil, starving the grass. This is the reason a fairy ring has dead grass over the growing edge of the mycelium. Umbrella-shaped fruiting bodies, called mushrooms, spring up from just behind the outer edge of the mycelium.  Large rings are created when the older mycelium in the center finally exhausts the soil nutrients and dies. On the death of the central mycelium, the nutrients are returned to the soil and grass can grow again.  The living edge of the mycelium continues to grow outward. As it grows, it secretes chemicals into the ground ahead. These chemicals break down the organic matter, releasing nutrients so that the mycelium will  have food when it reaches this area. For a brief time, the grass at the outer edge of the ring also benefits. The extra nutrients make the grass darker green, taller, and thicker than the rest of the lawn or pasture. This lush grass dies when the mycelium grows under it and steals the nutrients.  Fairy rings made by fungi like Marasmius oreades are called "free" rings. They will continue to grow outward until a barrier is reached. Sometimes the barrier is another fairy ring! Rings can grow into each other\'s territory and die as each reaches the other\'s "dead zone."  If there are no barriers, free rings can grow outward at up to 8 inches (20 cm) per year. They can reach a diameter of over 30 feet (10 m). One ring formed in France by the fungus Clitocybe geotropa is almost a half mile (600 m) in diameter. This ring is thought to be 700 years old.  Mycorrhizal fungi, which live in symbiotic partnership with trees, also form fairy rings. Their rings are called "tethered" rings. A tether is like a leash. The fungus and its mycorrhizal partner tree need each other to survive. The mycelium of these fungi always remains joined to the tree\'s roots. Roots are the "tether" that keeps the fairy rings of mycorrhizal fungi from growing too far from their tree.

By Martin Chilton , Culture Editor online  11:10AM GMT 28 Jan 2014  Follow  Pete Seeger, who was born in New York on May 3, 1919, had an upbringing steeped in music. His father, Charles, taught music at the University of California, Berkeley and his mother, Constance de Clyver Edson Seeger, was a concert violinist. His half-sister, Peggy, would become an eminent folk musician alongside Ewan McColl, and his half-brother Mike Seeger also became a folk singer.  Seeger, who has died at the age of 94, received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts, and, in 1996, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When Seeger\'s 90th birthday was celebrated, Bruce Springsteen hailed him as "a living archive of America’s music and conscience, a testament of the power of song and culture to nudge history along.”  Here are 10 of his greatest songs:  • WE SHALL OVERCOME  We Shall Overcome, which became a key song in the civil rights movement in the Sixties, has complex roots. Seeger (along with Frank Hamilton and Guy Carawan) adapted their version from several old gospel songs and a hymn, I\'ll Overcome, which had been sung by striking tobacco workers in South Carolina. They copyrighted their version and dictated that all of the song’s royalties went to the “We Shall Overcome” Fund, administered by what is now the Highlander Research and Education Centre. Seeger once said: "Nobody knows exactly who wrote the original. The original was faster." In August 1963, Joan Baez led a crowd of more than a quarter of a million people in singing We Shall Overcome at the Lincoln Memorial, during the famous March on Washington.  Related Articles  Pete Seeger  28 Jan 2014  Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen (right) during the We are One Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial on January 18, 2009, in Washington AFP/GETTY IMAGES  • WAIST DEEP IN THE BIG MUDDY  Pete Seeger wrote Waist Deep in the Big Muddy in protest at the conflict in Vietnam (a line about a dissenting sergeant being a \'nervous Nelly\' was a veiled attack on President Lyndon Johnson). Seeger performed the song on the television show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in September 1967 but it was cut by the CBS network. The Smothers Brothers (comedians and musicians Tommy and Dick) kicked up a fuss about the censorship, and Seeger was allowed to return and sing it on the show in February 1968. There have been fine cover versions by Dick Gaughan and Richard Shindell.  • IF I HAD A HAMMER (THE HAMMER SONG)  An activist song written in 1949 by Pete Seeger and his band-mate from The Weavers, Lee Hays. It is one of Seeger\'s most covered songs, with versions by Trini Lopez, Sam Cooke, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Four Tops, Luther Vandross and even Leonard Nimoy.  • OH, I HAD A GOLDEN THREAD  The song was written by Pete Seeger in 1958 and is often mistaken for a traditional song. Eva Cassidy said it was her favourite song and recorded a live version. Seeger said: "A rather gentle song came to me as I was fooling around on the guitar. Years later I realised that I had rewritten the melody of \'Nearer My God to Thee.\' Once again, you can see how the folk process has been aided by a bad memory."  • WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE?  A song Pete Seeger originally wrote in 1955 and to which additional verses were added by a teacher called Joe Hickerson in 1960. Seeger gave him 20 per cent of the royalties.

They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters.  Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.  Charters have been used in Europe since medieval times to create cities (that is, localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter is granted is considered to be when a city is 'founded', regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled (which is often impossible to determine).  At one time, a royal charter was the sole means by which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally used nowadays instead.  Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the British East India Company (1600), the Hudson's Bay Company, Standard Chartered, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), the British South Africa Company, and some of the former British colonies on the North American mainland, City livery companies, the Bank of England and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

In the period before 1958, 32 higher education institutes had been created by royal charter. These were typically engineering or technical institutions rather than universities.   However, several non-technical higher education institutions have been founded, or refounded, under royal decree:  * Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique, National Fund for Scientific Research, 1928   * Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten, 1938   * International Institute for Research and Education, 1982  Since the Belgian state reform of 1988–1989, competency over education was transferred to the federated entities of Belgium. Royal decrees can therefore no longer grant higher education institution status or university status.   Canada  A Royal Charter is granted by Order in Council, either creating an incorporated body, or giving an existent one special status.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique. There\'s a little bit of pleasure in pain, especially if you can share it with pals.

The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War,  First Iraq War, or Iraq War  before the term "Iraq War" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also referred to in the U.S. as "Operation Iraqi Freedom").   The Iraqi Army\'s occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council. U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition, the largest military alliance since World War II. The great majority of the Coalition\'s military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.   The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the U.S. network CNN.    The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm.    The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, continuing for five weeks. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The Coalition ceased its advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia\'s border. Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.  Terminology  The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:  *Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries. A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous, having now been applied to at least three conflicts: see Gulf War (disambiguation). The use of the term Persian Gulf (as opposed to Arabian Gulf) is also disputed: see Persian Gulf naming dispute. With no consensus of naming, various publications have attempted to refine the name.

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.

NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941.

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies.

Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research.

The island is roughly the size of Taiwan.  While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern ("New Pomerania").  Geography  New Britain extends from 148°18\'31" to 152°23\'57" E longitude and from 4°08\'25" to 6°18\'31" S latitude. It is crescent-shaped, approximately 520 km along its southeastern coastline, and from 29 to 146\xa0km (18–91\xa0miles) wide, not including a small central peninsula. The air-line distance from west to east is 477 km. The island is the 38th largest in the world, with an area of .  Steep cliffs form some sections of the coastline; in others the mountains are further inland, and the coastal area is flat and bordered by coral reefs. The highest point, at 2,438\xa0m (7,999\xa0ft), is Mount Sinewit in the Baining range in the east. Most of the terrain is covered with tropical rainforest and several large rivers are fed by the high rainfall.  New Britain was largely formed by volcanic processes, and there are several active volcanoes on the island, including Ulawun (the highest volcano in Papua New Guinea), Langila, the Garbuna Group, the Sulu Range, and the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan of the Rabaul caldera. A major eruption of Tavurvur in 1994 destroyed the East New Britain provincial capital of Rabaul. Most of the town still lies under metres of ash, and the capital has been moved to nearby Kokopo.  Administrative divisions  New Britain forms part of the Islands Region, one of four regions of Papua New Guinea. It comprises the mainland of two provinces:  * East New Britain with headquarters in Kokopo (formerly Rabaul)  * West New Britain with headquarters in Kimbe  Modern history   For the missionary history, see Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Solomon Islands  1700–1914  William Dampier became the first known European to visit New Britain on 27 February 1700: he dubbed the island with the Latin name Nova Britannia, (Eng: New Britain).  In November 1884, Germany proclaimed its protectorate over the New Britain Archipelago; the German colonial administration gave New Britain and New Ireland the names of Neupommern (or Neu-Pommern; "New Pomerania") and Neumecklenburg (or Neu-Mecklenburg; "New Mecklenburg") respectively, and the whole island group was renamed the Bismarck Archipelago. New Britain became part of German New Guinea.  In 1909, the indigenous population was estimated at about 190,000; the foreign population at 773 (474 white). The expatriate population was practically confined to the northeastern Gazelle Peninsula, which included the capital, Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo). At the time 5,448 hectares (13,464 acres) had been converted to plantations, primarily growing copra, cotton, coffee and rubber. Westerners avoided exploring the interior initially, believing that the indigenous peoples were warlike and would fiercely resist intrusions.  World War I  On 11 September 1914, New Britain became the site of one of the earliest battles of World War I when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island. They quickly overwhelmed the German forces and occupied the island for the duration of the war.  Between the world wars  After World War I the Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919, where Germany was stripped on all its possessions outside Europe. In 1920 the League of Nations included New Britain along with the former German colony on New Guinea in the Territory of New Guinea, a mandated territory of Australia.  World War II  During World War II the Japanese attacked New Britain soon after the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean. Strategic bases at Rabaul and Kavieng (New Ireland) were defended by a small Australian detachment, Lark Force. | Question: New Britain and New Ireland are two of the islands that make up which country?', ['papua new guinea'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6376'), ('Context: The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle\'s office in a protest over the university\'s off-campus rental policies.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

However, if we were to ask the question as to what types of animals dwelt in the forest, we might be hard pressed to give a correct answer.  Bears, perhaps? Or skunks, maybe? Do lions live in the forest or was that just a part of a make-believe children\'s story book? What kinds of animals really do call the forest their home?  A relatively temperate forest full of deciduous trees is quite different from a rain forest and houses different types of animals. Typical mammals found in this type of forest include the black bear, white-tailed deer, raccoon, coyote , grey squirrel, chipmunk, and other small rodents. Many different types of birds are also found in the temperate, deciduous forest including the Cardinal, Turkey, Eagle, and Goshawk among others.  Different types of snakes can be found in temperate forests such as the Garter Snake or the Rat Snake. If there is nearby water, various types of toads, lizards, and frogs might be seen around as well. Insects of all types love the forest including bumblebees, spiders, and mosquitoes.  Forest animals vary from area to area. Forest animals in the southern hemisphere are quite different than those in the northern. Even forests on the west and east coasts of the United States vary in habitants.

By Martin Chilton , Culture Editor online  11:10AM GMT 28 Jan 2014  Follow  Pete Seeger, who was born in New York on May 3, 1919, had an upbringing steeped in music. His father, Charles, taught music at the University of California, Berkeley and his mother, Constance de Clyver Edson Seeger, was a concert violinist. His half-sister, Peggy, would become an eminent folk musician alongside Ewan McColl, and his half-brother Mike Seeger also became a folk singer.  Seeger, who has died at the age of 94, received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a National Medal of Arts, and, in 1996, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When Seeger\'s 90th birthday was celebrated, Bruce Springsteen hailed him as "a living archive of America’s music and conscience, a testament of the power of song and culture to nudge history along.”  Here are 10 of his greatest songs:  • WE SHALL OVERCOME  We Shall Overcome, which became a key song in the civil rights movement in the Sixties, has complex roots. Seeger (along with Frank Hamilton and Guy Carawan) adapted their version from several old gospel songs and a hymn, I\'ll Overcome, which had been sung by striking tobacco workers in South Carolina. They copyrighted their version and dictated that all of the song’s royalties went to the “We Shall Overcome” Fund, administered by what is now the Highlander Research and Education Centre. Seeger once said: "Nobody knows exactly who wrote the original. The original was faster." In August 1963, Joan Baez led a crowd of more than a quarter of a million people in singing We Shall Overcome at the Lincoln Memorial, during the famous March on Washington.

Seeger performed the song on the television show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in September 1967 but it was cut by the CBS network. The Smothers Brothers (comedians and musicians Tommy and Dick) kicked up a fuss about the censorship, and Seeger was allowed to return and sing it on the show in February 1968. There have been fine cover versions by Dick Gaughan and Richard Shindell.  • IF I HAD A HAMMER (THE HAMMER SONG)  An activist song written in 1949 by Pete Seeger and his band-mate from The Weavers, Lee Hays. It is one of Seeger\'s most covered songs, with versions by Trini Lopez, Sam Cooke, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Four Tops, Luther Vandross and even Leonard Nimoy.  • OH, I HAD A GOLDEN THREAD  The song was written by Pete Seeger in 1958 and is often mistaken for a traditional song. Eva Cassidy said it was her favourite song and recorded a live version. Seeger said: "A rather gentle song came to me as I was fooling around on the guitar. Years later I realised that I had rewritten the melody of \'Nearer My God to Thee.\' Once again, you can see how the folk process has been aided by a bad memory."  • WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE?  A song Pete Seeger originally wrote in 1955 and to which additional verses were added by a teacher called Joe Hickerson in 1960. Seeger gave him 20 per cent of the royalties. Where Have All the Flowers Gone? was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002 | Question: Which folk singer and activist who died in 2014 aged 94 years co-wrote the songs Where Have All The Flowers Gone, If I had a Hammer and adapted the song Turn, Turn, Turn from the Book of Ecclesiastes?', ['pete seeger'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5494'), ("Context: Mary Poppins Returns is an upcoming American musical fantasy film directed by Rob Marshall , with a screenplay by David Magee , songs by Marc Shaiman & Scott Wittman , from a story by Magee , Marshall , and John DeLuca .

They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters.  Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.  Charters have been used in Europe since medieval times to create cities (that is, localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter is granted is considered to be when a city is 'founded', regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled (which is often impossible to determine).  At one time, a royal charter was the sole means by which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally used nowadays instead.  Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the British East India Company (1600), the Hudson's Bay Company, Standard Chartered, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), the British South Africa Company, and some of the former British colonies on the North American mainland, City livery companies, the Bank of England and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).   Australia  * Scout Association of Australia (23 August 1967)  Universities and colleges  * The University of Sydney obtained a Royal Charter in 1858  (3 February 1858)  * The University of Tasmania obtained a Royal Charter (Letters Patent) in 1915  (30 August 1915)  * The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology  Companies and societies  * Van Diemen's Land Company received a Royal Charter in 1825  Professional organisations  * Royal Australasian College of Surgeons  * Australian Institute of Building  * Engineers Australia  * Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia  * Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers  * Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia Incorporated  * Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists  * Royal Australian Artillery Association  * Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists  * Royal Australian Chemical Institute  * Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators  * Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors  Other organisations   * Royal Automobile Club of Queensland  *Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland  * Royal Queensland Art Society  * Royal Queensland Golf Club  * Royal Queensland Regiment  * Royal Queensland Show   * Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron  Belgium  The royal decree is the equivalent in Belgium of a Royal Charter. In the period before 1958, 32 higher education institutes had been created by royal charter. These were typically engineering or technical institutions rather than universities.   However, several non-technical higher education institutions have been founded, or refounded, under royal decree:  * Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique, National Fund for Scientific Research, 1928   * Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten, 1938   * International Institute for Research and Education, 1982  Since the Belgian state reform of 1988–1989, competency over education was transferred to the federated entities of Belgium. Royal decrees can therefore no longer grant higher education institution status or university status.   Canada  A Royal Charter is granted by Order in Council, either creating an incorporated body, or giving an existent one special status.  This is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative, and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organisations under Royal Charters.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face. It\'s not like you have to take a test of strength to darken my doorstep – it\'s that there\'s an easily conjured conviviality, not to mention earned respect, in quaffing something so potent and unique.

The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War,  First Iraq War, or Iraq War  before the term "Iraq War" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also referred to in the U.S. as "Operation Iraqi Freedom").   The Iraqi Army\'s occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council. U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition, the largest military alliance since World War II. The great majority of the Coalition\'s military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.   The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the U.S. network CNN.    The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm.    The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, continuing for five weeks. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The Coalition ceased its advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia\'s border. Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.  Terminology  The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:  *Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries. A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous, having now been applied to at least three conflicts: see Gulf War (disambiguation). The use of the term Persian Gulf (as opposed to Arabian Gulf) is also disputed: see Persian Gulf naming dispute. With no consensus of naming, various publications have attempted to refine the name. Some variants include:  **Gulf War (e.g. The Gulf War, BBC television series, 2005; Modern Conflicts: The Gulf War, Discovery Channel DVD set, 2010)  **Persian Gulf War (e.g. Encyclopedia of the Persian Gulf War, Mark Grossman, 1995; An Operational Analysis of the Persian Gulf War, U.S. Army War College, 2016)  **Gulf War (1990–1991) (e.g. The Gulf War 1991 (Essential Histories), Alastair Finlan, 2003; Gulf War, 1990-91, William Thomas Allison, 2012)  **First Gulf War (to distinguish it from the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent Iraq War) (e.g. Gulf War One: Real Voices from the Front Line, Hugh McManners, 2010)  **Second Gulf War (to distinguish it from the Iran–Iraq War) (e.g. Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State Building and Regime Security, Mohammad-Mahmoud Mohamedou, 1997)  *Liberation of Kuwait () (taḥrīr al-kuwayt) is the term used by Kuwait and most of the Coalition\'s Arab states including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.  *Other language terms include  and  (Gulf War);  (Second | Question: August 2, 1990 saw Iraq invading what country, sparking a series of events that culminated in the 1st Gulf War?', ['kuwait', 'kuw', 'state of kuwait', 'kuwaitis'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7703'), ('Context: The Russo-Japanese War - Russian RevolutionThe Russo-Japanese War  The Russo-Japanese War  An artistic depiction of the Russo-Japanese War  The Russo-Japanese War was a brief conflict but created significant problems for the tsarist regime. It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread. British war strategy had most of Australia’s best forces committed to the Middle East.

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies. Skylab was 30.2 metres (99 feet) in length and 6.7 metres (22 feet) in diameter and had a mass of about 75,000 kg (165,000 pounds). Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research.

Skylab hosted two additional three-man crews for missions lasting 59 and 84 days. Each of the three Skylab missions set a new space endurance record. Although plans called for Skylab to be used again with one of the first space shuttle missions boosting it to a higher orbit, increased solar activity caused its orbit to degrade faster than expected.

It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George\'s Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan.  While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern ("New Pomerania").  Geography  New Britain extends from 148°18\'31" to 152°23\'57" E longitude and from 4°08\'25" to 6°18\'31" S latitude. It is crescent-shaped, approximately 520 km along its southeastern coastline, and from 29 to 146\xa0km (18–91\xa0miles) wide, not including a small central peninsula. The air-line distance from west to east is 477 km. The island is the 38th largest in the world, with an area of .  Steep cliffs form some sections of the coastline; in others the mountains are further inland, and the coastal area is flat and bordered by coral reefs. The highest point, at 2,438\xa0m (7,999\xa0ft), is Mount Sinewit in the Baining range in the east. Most of the terrain is covered with tropical rainforest and several large rivers are fed by the high rainfall.  New Britain was largely formed by volcanic processes, and there are several active volcanoes on the island, including Ulawun (the highest volcano in Papua New Guinea), Langila, the Garbuna Group, the Sulu Range, and the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan of the Rabaul caldera. A major eruption of Tavurvur in 1994 destroyed the East New Britain provincial capital of Rabaul. Most of the town still lies under metres of ash, and the capital has been moved to nearby Kokopo.  Administrative divisions  New Britain forms part of the Islands Region, one of four regions of Papua New Guinea. It comprises the mainland of two provinces:  * East New Britain with headquarters in Kokopo (formerly Rabaul)  * West New Britain with headquarters in Kimbe  Modern history   For the missionary history, see Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Solomon Islands  1700–1914  William Dampier became the first known European to visit New Britain on 27 February 1700: he dubbed the island with the Latin name Nova Britannia, (Eng: New Britain).  In November 1884, Germany proclaimed its protectorate over the New Britain Archipelago; the German colonial administration gave New Britain and New Ireland the names of Neupommern (or Neu-Pommern; "New Pomerania") and Neumecklenburg (or Neu-Mecklenburg; "New Mecklenburg") respectively, and the whole island group was renamed the Bismarck Archipelago. New Britain became part of German New Guinea.  In 1909, the indigenous population was estimated at about 190,000; the foreign population at 773 (474 white). The expatriate population was practically confined to the northeastern Gazelle Peninsula, which included the capital, Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo). At the time 5,448 hectares (13,464 acres) had been converted to plantations, primarily growing copra, cotton, coffee and rubber. Westerners avoided exploring the interior initially, believing that the indigenous peoples were warlike and would fiercely resist intrusions.  World War I  On 11 September 1914, New Britain became the site of one of the earliest battles of World War I when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island. They quickly overwhelmed the German forces and occupied the island for the duration of the war.  Between the world wars  After World War I the Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919, where Germany was stripped on all its possessions outside Europe. In 1920 the League of Nations included New Britain along with the former German colony on New Guinea in the Territory of New Guinea, a mandated territory of Australia.  World War II  During World War II the Japanese attacked New Britain soon after the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Typical mammals found in this type of forest include the black bear, white-tailed deer, raccoon, coyote , grey squirrel, chipmunk, and other small rodents. Many different types of birds are also found in the temperate, deciduous forest including the Cardinal, Turkey, Eagle, and Goshawk among others.  Different types of snakes can be found in temperate forests such as the Garter Snake or the Rat Snake.

Now, the 1984 romantic comedy is getting a remake – this time with a twist.  Producer Brain Grazer admitted during an interview with CNBC that a remake of “Splash”; was in the works. While Grazer kept mostly mum on the details, he revealed that this version of the story would be told from the mermaid’s perspective.

''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

Now, the 1984 romantic comedy is getting a remake – this time with a twist.  Producer Brain Grazer admitted during an interview with CNBC that a remake of “Splash”; was in the works. While Grazer kept mostly mum on the details, he revealed that this version of the story would be told from the mermaid’s perspective.

Simply titled “Wet”;, there’s no word on if the film’s original stars will appear in the sequel, but Grazer did share at least one big name could be attached to the project.  “There’s a movie star involved, or going to be involved,”; Grazer said during the interview. “I haven’t announced it.”;  RELATED: Casting Call: Stars Nab A New Role Gallery  “Wet”;”s mermaid star would certainly be at home on land or sea.

''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge).

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

Right-handed knights preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent  In the past, almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.  Furthermore, a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse, and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword (which would be worn on the left). It is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road, rather than in the middle of traffic, so if one mounts on the left, then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road.  In the late 1700s, however, teamsters in France and the United States began hauling farm products in big wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. These wagons had no driver’s seat; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse, so he could keep his right arm free to lash the team. Since he was sitting on the left, he naturally wanted everybody to pass on the left so he could look down and make sure he kept clear of the oncoming wagon’s wheels. Therefore he kept to the right side of the road.  In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth (Elizaveta Petrovna) officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right.\xa0In addition, the French Revolution of 1789 gave a huge impetus to right-hand travel in Europe. The fact is, before the Revolution, the aristocracy travelled on the left of the road, forcing the peasantry over to the right, but after the storming of the Bastille and the subsequent events, aristocrats preferred to keep a low profile and joined the peasants on the right. An official keep-right rule was introduced in Paris in 1794, more or less parallel to Denmark, where driving on the right had been made compulsory in 1793.  French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1812)  Later, Napoleon’s conquests spread the new rightism to the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), Switzerland, Germany, Poland and many parts of Spain and Italy. The states that had resisted Napoleon kept left – Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Portugal. This European division, between the left- and right-hand nations would remain fixed for more than 100 years, until after the First World War.  Although left-driving Sweden ceded Finland to right-driving Russia after the Finnish War (1808-1809), Swedish law – including traffic regulations – remained valid in Finland for another 50 years. It wasn’t until 1858 that an Imperial Russian decree made Finland swap sides.  The trend among nations over the years has been toward driving on the right, but Britain has done its best to stave off global homogenisation. With the expansion of travel and road building in the 1800s, traffic regulations were made in every country. Left-hand driving was made mandatory in Britain in 1835.

"It\'s the deadliest thing in the sea," according to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in Washington. "Victims usually experience shock, muscular cramps, numbness, nausea, vomiting, severe backache, frothing at the mouth, constriction of the throat, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, paralysis, delirium, convulsion and, finally, death."  Dozens of people are killed each year by these transparent, grapefruit-size predators. So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  "Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks," said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. "That\'s because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim\'s susceptibility to the creature\'s venom."  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp\'s venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra\'s, only deadlier.  "Even a mild brush can cause intense pain," writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. "The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time."  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp\'s long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  "Stay out of those waters at all costs," advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World\'s Most Dangerous Creatures. "Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don\'t actually come after humans to attack."  Syndicated writer Randall Floyd lives in Augusta.

Usually a quiet and unoccupied space, this morning 100 invited guests thronged around the seven-tonne block of Portland stone which makes up the centrepiece of this memorial, accompanied by the crisp but comforting tones of the Windsor-based Band of the Blues and Royals.  In an address, the new US ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun described how at Runnymede the bond between the two countries is in literally set in stone.  As the band played both the American and British national anthems, wreaths were laid at the foot of the memorial which stands in an acre of land bequeathed by the Crown in 1965 when the memorial was erected - technically the only American soil in the UK.  Ms Schlossberg said: "It is an incredible honour to have a memorial here at Runnymede, the sacred ground of democratic and constitutional government.  "As a lover of history, particularly British history, I know my grandfather would be both proud and humble to see that his work on behalf of peace and liberty for all people is remembered in the very place where the rule of law was made manifest nearly 800 years ago."

He said the memorial represented the two nations\' special relationship.  Mr Barzun, who also laid a wreath, said: "It\'s a very powerful and important day that we are here.  "This place that we\'re gathered, this incredible memorial behind you and also the acre of land that you are standing on, was given by the British people to America so I\'m talking to you on American soil.

Last update: 7 February 2016  Google+175  History and origin  About a 35% of the world population drives on the left , and the countries that do are mostly old British colonies. This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world, but there is a perfectly good reason. Click here for a world map and a full list of all countries of the world and the side of the road on which they drive.  Right-handed knights preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent  In the past, almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.  Furthermore, a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse, and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword (which would be worn on the left). It is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road, rather than in the middle of traffic, so if one mounts on the left, then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road.  In the late 1700s, however, teamsters in France and the United States began hauling farm products in big wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. These wagons had no driver’s seat; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse, so he could keep his right arm free to lash the team. Since he was sitting on the left, he naturally wanted everybody to pass on the left so he could look down and make sure he kept clear of the oncoming wagon’s wheels. Therefore he kept to the right side of the road.  In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth (Elizaveta Petrovna) officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right.\xa0In addition, the French Revolution of 1789 gave a huge impetus to right-hand travel in Europe. The fact is, before the Revolution, the aristocracy travelled on the left of the road, forcing the peasantry over to the right, but after the storming of the Bastille and the subsequent events, aristocrats preferred to keep a low profile and joined the peasants on the right. An official keep-right rule was introduced in Paris in 1794, more or less parallel to Denmark, where driving on the right had been made compulsory in 1793.  French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1812)  Later, Napoleon’s conquests spread the new rightism to the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), Switzerland, Germany, Poland and many parts of Spain and Italy. The states that had resisted Napoleon kept left – Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Portugal. This European division, between the left- and right-hand nations would remain fixed for more than 100 years, until after the First World War.  Although left-driving Sweden ceded Finland to right-driving Russia after the Finnish War (1808-1809), Swedish law – including traffic regulations – remained valid in Finland for another 50 years. It wasn’t until 1858 that an Imperial Russian decree made Finland swap sides.  The trend among nations over the years has been toward driving on the right, but Britain has done its best to stave off global homogenisation. With the expansion of travel and road building in the 1800s, traffic regulations were made in every country. Left-hand driving was made mandatory in Britain in 1835.

"It\'s the deadliest thing in the sea," according to the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office in Washington. "Victims usually experience shock, muscular cramps, numbness, nausea, vomiting, severe backache, frothing at the mouth, constriction of the throat, loss of speech, difficulty in breathing, paralysis, delirium, convulsion and, finally, death."  Dozens of people are killed each year by these transparent, grapefruit-size predators. So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  "Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks," said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. "That\'s because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim\'s susceptibility to the creature\'s venom."  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp\'s venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra\'s, only deadlier.  "Even a mild brush can cause intense pain," writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. "The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time."  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp\'s long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  "Stay out of those waters at all costs," advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World\'s Most Dangerous Creatures. "Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don\'t actually come after humans to attack."  Syndicated writer Randall Floyd lives in Augusta.

As the band played both the American and British national anthems, wreaths were laid at the foot of the memorial which stands in an acre of land bequeathed by the Crown in 1965 when the memorial was erected - technically the only American soil in the UK.

Belfast West was the fourth by-election held since the 2010 General Election. There were 6 candidates on the ballot paper.  The by-election was called after the former MP, Gerry Adams, vacated his seat.

Profile: The most Catholic seat in Northern Ireland, the heartland of Republicanism and the poorest and most depressed in Northern Ireland. It is a young seat of council housing, the unemployed poor, and single parent families.  The core of the seat is the Falls Road area, with the municipal terraces and paramilitary murals that characterise the public image of Northern Ireland and the troubles. To the north – across the barricades of the peace line – is part of the loyalist stronghold of the Shankill and to the south the estates of Twinbrook and Poleglass. There are comparatively middle class pockets, and pockets of protestants like Suffolk, but mostly this is a homogenous, poor, working class Catholic seat.  In the past this seat was represented by Gerry Fitt, who won it as Republican Labour in 1966, founded the SDLP in 1970 and left his own party in 1979. He failed to retain the seat as an independent in 1983 and the split nationalist vote alowed Gerry Adams to become the first Sinn Fein MP for decades. Adams lost his seat to the SDLP’s Joe Hendron in 1992, but won it back in 1997 and – with the addition of Poleglass and Twinbrook in the 1990s it became a safe Sinn Fein seat. Sinn Fein are now totally dominant here – securing over seventy percent of the vote and, in a remarkable bit of vote management, managing to secure 5 out of the 6 seats here in the 2007 assembly elections (the other being held by the SDLP’s Alex Attwood).  Current MP: Paul Maskey (Sinn Fein) Born 1969. Belfast councillor 2001-2009. MLA for Belfast West since 2007.  2011 By-election.  Gerry Adams resigned from the Commons on the 26th January 2011 in order to contest the seat of Louth in the Republic of Ireland general election. Adams initially refused to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds or manor of Northstead, instead attempting to resign by writing to the Speaker. He was subsequently appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead. The by-election was held on the 9th June and was a easy hold for Sinn Fein.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand. It sits behind a goal, with the family stand to the right, main stand to the left, and the kop directly opposite.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database. There is no transcript for a trial of a Sweeney Todd, nor for that matter any similar crimes.

The bill was the outcome of years of suffragette meetings in towns and cities across the country, with women often traveling considerable distances to hear lectures and speeches, pass resolutions, and sign petitions. New Zealand women first went to the polls in the national elections of November 1893.  The United States granted women the right to vote in 1920, and Great Britain guaranteed full voting rights for women in 1928.

Courtesy of the State Library of South Australia.  Suffrage, or the right to vote, is something that Australians have not always been able to take for granted. In 1902, Australia was the first country in the world to give women both the right to vote in federal elections and also the right to be elected to parliament on a national basis. New Zealand granted women the right to vote in 1893.  Commonwealth women's suffrage in Australia reflected the rights of women to seek election in South Australia and to vote in Western Australia, rights granted in 1895 and 1899 respectively. Indigenous people as a group were not granted suffrage in federal elections until 1962, although South Australia granted suffrage to Aboriginal women as early as 1894, and the Commonwealth Constitution stated that anyone with a state vote was entitled to a Commonwealth vote.  'Suffragettes' was a term used around the world to describe all women who campaigned for the right to vote in elections. From the 1880s and through the 1890s each Australian colony had at least one suffragette society. These societies published leaflets; organised debates, public meetings and letter-writing campaigns; and arranged deputations to members of their colonial parliaments. In 1891, suffragettes including Vida Goldstein gathered 30,000 women's signatures and presented them as a petition to the Victorian Parliament. In 1894, Mary Lee and others presented a petition from 11,600 women in South Australia and the Northern Territory.  The suffragettes argued that women should be able to vote and stand for election because the wishes of women should be reflected in parliament. They argued that a government 'by the people' should include government by women, because laws affect women as much as they do men.  Politics and Australian women in the nineteenth century  Men govern the world and the schemes upon which all our institutions are founded show men's thoughts only.  Louisa Lawson, writer, feminist and suffragist in her editorial in Dawn: a Journal for Australian women, October 1890.  'Some foolish people imagine our ladies will neglect their family duties. Quite a mistake. 3 am. That dear good old creature, Mr Speaker, is kind enough to take the blessed infant while the Hon. Member addresses the house', 1887. Punch magazine Melbourne. Courtesy of the Parliament of Victoria.  In the 19th century, a woman's place was still very firmly in the home. Although small numbers of women were attending university and seeking a career for themselves, most women's lives were restricted to the home and the exhausting physical work of maintaining a house and raising a family.  The thought that a woman was capable of focusing her attention on matters such as politics was incomprehensible to many men, and some women, who opposed the fight for female suffrage. They portrayed women as emotional, weak and unable to make decisions as well as being consumed with domestic and trivial matters.  Nineteenth century civilisation has accorded to women the same political status as to the idiot and the criminal. Such is the basis of our reverence for the person of women and of our estimate of her work.

10/01/2021 12:16:17 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: Fawlty TowersFawlty Towers is a BBC television sitcom that was first broadcast on BBC2 in 1975 and 1979. 12 episodes were made (two series, each of six episodes). The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand.

Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic.  Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern, manufactured version was invented, apparently in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.   The modern slide whistle is perhaps most familiar in its use as a sound effect (as in the sound tracks of animated cartoons, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a "Bankrupt" on Wheel of Fortune), but it is also possible to play melodies on the slide whistle.  The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens & Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the USA, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example it was used on Paul Whiteman\'s early hit recording of Whispering (1920).  Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver\'s Creole Jazz Band.  At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler\'s Jug Band.  In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul \'Hezzie\' Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.  A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song "Get Up" by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit "Groove Is in the Heart". The Las Vegas based band Holes and Hearts also used the slide whistle on their song "Dancing Monkey".  Fred Schneider of The B-52s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song "Party Out of Bounds" as a prop for the song\'s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the Wild Planet song.  In 2011 the slide whistle has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, with top session players such as Seadna McPhail guesting on a host of top selling pop albums.  The slide whistle is probably thought of today primarily as a kind of "toy" instrument, especially in the West, although it has been and continues to be used in various forms of "serious" music.  Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera, L\'enfant et les sortilèges. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith\'s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio\'s Passaggio, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.  To fans of 1970s BBC children\'s television, the instrument will always be associated with the voices of the Clangers. The instrument also features prominently in the game of "Swanee-Kazoo" in the long-running radio panel game, I\'m Sorry I Haven\'t a Clue.

In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

Courtesy of the State Library of South Australia.  Suffrage, or the right to vote, is something that Australians have not always been able to take for granted. In 1902, Australia was the first country in the world to give women both the right to vote in federal elections and also the right to be elected to parliament on a national basis. New Zealand granted women the right to vote in 1893.  Commonwealth women's suffrage in Australia reflected the rights of women to seek election in South Australia and to vote in Western Australia, rights granted in 1895 and 1899 respectively. Indigenous people as a group were not granted suffrage in federal elections until 1962, although South Australia granted suffrage to Aboriginal women as early as 1894, and the Commonwealth Constitution stated that anyone with a state vote was entitled to a Commonwealth vote.  'Suffragettes' was a term used around the world to describe all women who campaigned for the right to vote in elections. From the 1880s and through the 1890s each Australian colony had at least one suffragette society. These societies published leaflets; organised debates, public meetings and letter-writing campaigns; and arranged deputations to members of their colonial parliaments. In 1891, suffragettes including Vida Goldstein gathered 30,000 women's signatures and presented them as a petition to the Victorian Parliament. In 1894, Mary Lee and others presented a petition from 11,600 women in South Australia and the Northern Territory.  The suffragettes argued that women should be able to vote and stand for election because the wishes of women should be reflected in parliament. They argued that a government 'by the people' should include government by women, because laws affect women as much as they do men.  Politics and Australian women in the nineteenth century  Men govern the world and the schemes upon which all our institutions are founded show men's thoughts only.  Louisa Lawson, writer, feminist and suffragist in her editorial in Dawn: a Journal for Australian women, October 1890.  'Some foolish people imagine our ladies will neglect their family duties. Quite a mistake. 3 am. That dear good old creature, Mr Speaker, is kind enough to take the blessed infant while the Hon. Member addresses the house', 1887. Punch magazine Melbourne. Courtesy of the Parliament of Victoria.  In the 19th century, a woman's place was still very firmly in the home. Although small numbers of women were attending university and seeking a career for themselves, most women's lives were restricted to the home and the exhausting physical work of maintaining a house and raising a family.  The thought that a woman was capable of focusing her attention on matters such as politics was incomprehensible to many men, and some women, who opposed the fight for female suffrage. They portrayed women as emotional, weak and unable to make decisions as well as being consumed with domestic and trivial matters.  Nineteenth century civilisation has accorded to women the same political status as to the idiot and the criminal. Such is the basis of our reverence for the person of women and of our estimate of her work.

This film adaptation was directed by David Fincher and written by Steven Zaillian. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: Sherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths | Books | The GuardianSherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths | Books | The Guardian  Arthur Conan Doyle  Sherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths  We think we know all about Conan Doyle\'s immortal detective, with his pipes, dressing-gown and cocaine – but do we really, asks Sam Leith  Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

The school consisted of Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Empedocles.  It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus.  The Pluralists rejected the idea that the diversity of nature can be reduced to a single principle (monism).  Anaxagoras posited that nature contained an innumerable number of principles, while Empedocles reduced nature to four elements (fire, air, earth, and water) which could not be reduced to one another and which would be sufficient to explain change and diversity.   Leucippus  Leucippus ( ; Greek: Λεύκιππος , "Leúkippos"; fl.  5th cent.  BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory.  However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed.  As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus\'s word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century.  Furthermore, in his "Corpus Democriteum", Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: Spike (TV network)Spike (formerly and popularly known as Spike TV) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Viacom Music and Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War. This was likely an attempt to compete with Universal\'s USA Network which Viacom (through Paramount) had briefly owned a stake in during the mid-1990s.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills.

Mammy Two Shoes (sometimes Mrs. Two Shoes) is a recurring character in MGM \'s Tom and Jerry cartoons. She is a heavy-set middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters.  As a partially seen character , she was famous for never showing her face (except very briefly in Saturday Evening Puss ). Mammy\'s appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. It was later revealed that her character was greatly inspired by Oscar -winning black actress and singer Hattie McDaniel , best known for playing "Mammy" in MGM and David O. Selznick \'s 1939 film Gone with the Wind .  A character very similar to Mammy Two Shoes had earlier been portrayed in the Disney Silly Symphonies shorts Three Orphan Kittens and More Kittens , as well as the Pluto short Pantry Pirate and the Figaro short Figaro and Cleo .

Mammy first appeared in Puss Gets the Boot , the first Tom and Jerry cartoon (except Tom was called "Jasper"). She always referred to Tom as his given name Thomas and almost always used "is" in conjunction with a pronoun ("is you" and "I is"). The character went on to make many appearances through the entire series until 1952 and her last appearance in the short, Push-Button Kitty . William Hanna and Joseph Barbera initially portrayed Mammy as the maid of the house, with the real owners unknown to us. Later, Hanna and Barbera seemed to suggest, through dialogue and occasional behavior, that the house was Mammy\'s own.  Mammy was originally voiced by well-known African-American character actress Lillian Randolph . In the 1960s, the MGM animation studio , by then under the supervision of Chuck Jones , created censored versions of the Tom & Jerry cartoons featuring Mammy for television. These versions used rotoscoping techniques to replace Mammy on-screen with a similarly stocky white woman (in most shorts) or a thin white woman (in Saturday Evening Puss); Randolph\'s voice on the soundtracks was replaced by an Irish-accented (or, in Puss, generic young adult) voice performed by white actress June Foray . [1]  The original versions of the cartoons were reinstated when Turner Broadcasting acquired ownership of the Tom & Jerry property. But in 1992, the cartoons featuring Mammy were edited again; this time, to replace Lillian Randolph\'s voice with that of Thea Vidale , who re-recorded the dialogue to remove Mammy\'s use of potentially offensive dialect . These re-recorded versions of the cartoons are aired to this day on Turner\'s Cartoon Network -related cable channels, and have at times turned up on DVD as well. However, some European TV showings of these cartoons, especially the UK, retain Randolph\'s original voice.

Career  In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called "Natural Blonde" in the Record Mirror, shortly after posing for Penthouse magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme The Tube. She also appeared alongside friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof \'mockumentary\' on Bananarama.  In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin\'".   After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood.  Yates continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show The Tube. She became most notorious for her "on the bed" interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof.  On 27 October 1995, Yates appeared on the quiz programme Have I Got News for You and clashed with Ian Hislop over comments he had previously made about her breast enlargement surgery.  Yates referred to Hislop as "the sperm of the devil", to which Hislop replied, "Even your insults emanate from the genitals!"  Personal life  Yates met Geldof in the early days of the Boomtown Rats. They became a couple in 1976 when she flew to Paris to surprise him while the band was playing there. Their first daughter, Fifi Trixibelle, was born on 31 March 1983,  named Fifi after Bob\'s aunt Fifi and Trixibelle because Paula wanted a belle in the family.  After ten years together, they married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran acting as Geldof\'s best man. The couple then had two more daughters, Peaches Geldof  on 13 March 1989, and Pixie Geldof on 17 September 1990.  Yates first met Michael Hutchence in a 1985 interview on Channel 4\'s rock magazine programme The Tube.  During this appearance on The Tube, Yates was reportedly asked to leave Hutchence alone by the road manager of INXS when Paula walked up to him and said, "I\'m going to have that boy." Paula was unmoved and began to show up at INXS gigs everywhere for the next few years...she even brought her daughter (Fifi Geldof).  Yates maintained irregular contact with Hutchence during the intervening nine years and their affair had been underway long before the Big Breakfast interview.  In February 1995, Yates left Geldof.  Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996. Yates\'s daughter with Hutchence, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence (known as \'Tiger\') was born on 22 July 1996.   On 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in a hotel room in Sydney. Paula Yates wrote in her police statement that Michael Hutchence was "frightened and couldn\'t stand a minute more without his baby."

Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Today, Church leaders oversee Church operations in some 160 countries from this location. However, leadership is heavily decentralized throughout the world, with local, regional and national levels of administration operating mainly through a lay clergy.  Temple Square is Utah’s number one tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors a year. Temple Square consists of the Salt Lake Temple, the Tabernacle (home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir), the Assembly Hall and two visitors’ centers.  To the east of Temple Square is a plaza where the Church Office Building, Church Administration Building, Joseph Smith Memorial Building and Relief Society Building are located. All of these buildings are used for offices for Church departments and general leadership.  West of Temple Square is the Family History Library — the world’s largest genealogical facility — and the Museum of Church History and Art.  North of Temple Square sits the Conference Center — a 21,000-seat auditorium, one of the largest in the world. It is used for semiannual meetings broadcast worldwide for the entire Church membership, as well as frequent closed-circuit conferences broadcast to specific groups of members in different parts of the world.

This film adaptation was directed by David Fincher and written by Steven Zaillian. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: Sherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths | Books | The GuardianSherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths | Books | The Guardian  Arthur Conan Doyle  Sherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths  We think we know all about Conan Doyle\'s immortal detective, with his pipes, dressing-gown and cocaine – but do we really, asks Sam Leith  Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series.

It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

The school consisted of Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Empedocles.  It can also be said to have included the Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus.  The Pluralists rejected the idea that the diversity of nature can be reduced to a single principle (monism).  Anaxagoras posited that nature contained an innumerable number of principles, while Empedocles reduced nature to four elements (fire, air, earth, and water) which could not be reduced to one another and which would be sufficient to explain change and diversity.   Leucippus  Leucippus ( ; Greek: Λεύκιππος , "Leúkippos"; fl.  5th cent.  BCE) is reported in some ancient sources to have been a philosopher who was the earliest Greek to develop the theory of atomism—the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called atoms. Leucippus often appears as the master to his pupil Democritus, a philosopher also touted as the originator of the atomic theory.  However, a brief notice in Diogenes Laertius’s life of Epicurus says that on the testimony of Epicurus, Leucippus never existed.  As the philosophical heir of Democritus, Epicurus\'s word has some weight, and indeed a controversy over this matter raged in German scholarship for many years at the close of the 19th century.  Furthermore, in his "Corpus Democriteum", Thrasyllus of Alexandria, an astrologer and writer living under the emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), compiled a list of writings on atomism that he attributed to Democritus to the exclusion of Leucippus.  The present consensus among the world\'s historians of philosophy is that this Leucippus is historical.  The matter must remain moot unless more information is forthcoming from the record. | Question: The Pluralist school is said to have included what creator of the theory of atomism?', ['Leucippus'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-2340'), ('Context: The Dingoes  The Dingoes is an Australian country rock band initially active from 1973 to 1979, formed in Melbourne which relocated to the United States from 1976.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, | Question: A bagel is a type of what?', ['bread', 'breads', 'bread making'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896'), ('Context: Spike (TV network)Spike (formerly and popularly known as Spike TV) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Viacom Music and Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen.

Mammy Two Shoes (sometimes Mrs. Two Shoes) is a recurring character in MGM \'s Tom and Jerry cartoons. She is a heavy-set middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters.  As a partially seen character , she was famous for never showing her face (except very briefly in Saturday Evening Puss ). Mammy\'s appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. It was later revealed that her character was greatly inspired by Oscar -winning black actress and singer Hattie McDaniel , best known for playing "Mammy" in MGM and David O. Selznick \'s 1939 film Gone with the Wind .  A character very similar to Mammy Two Shoes had earlier been portrayed in the Disney Silly Symphonies shorts Three Orphan Kittens and More Kittens , as well as the Pluto short Pantry Pirate and the Figaro short Figaro and Cleo .

Contents  7 References  \xa0 Theatrical Tom and Jerry cartoons  \xa0 Mammy Two Shoes, in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , whose full face was shown for the first time.  Mammy first appeared in Puss Gets the Boot , the first Tom and Jerry cartoon (except Tom was called "Jasper"). She always referred to Tom as his given name Thomas and almost always used "is" in conjunction with a pronoun ("is you" and "I is"). The character went on to make many appearances through the entire series until 1952 and her last appearance in the short, Push-Button Kitty . William Hanna and Joseph Barbera initially portrayed Mammy as the maid of the house, with the real owners unknown to us. Later, Hanna and Barbera seemed to suggest, through dialogue and occasional behavior, that the house was Mammy\'s own.  Mammy was originally voiced by well-known African-American character actress Lillian Randolph . In the 1960s, the MGM animation studio , by then under the supervision of Chuck Jones , created censored versions of the Tom & Jerry cartoons featuring Mammy for television. These versions used rotoscoping techniques to replace Mammy on-screen with a similarly stocky white woman (in most shorts) or a thin white woman (in Saturday Evening Puss); Randolph\'s voice on the soundtracks was replaced by an Irish-accented (or, in Puss, generic young adult) voice performed by white actress June Foray . [1]  The original versions of the cartoons were reinstated when Turner Broadcasting acquired ownership of the Tom & Jerry property. But in 1992, the cartoons featuring Mammy were edited again; this time, to replace Lillian Randolph\'s voice with that of Thea Vidale , who re-recorded the dialogue to remove Mammy\'s use of potentially offensive dialect .

It was dubbed and shown in the United Kingdom on CBBC.  It\'s narrated by Regine Candler   Stop motion  Stop motion (hyphenated stop-motion when used as an adjective) is an animation technique that physically manipulates an object so that it appears to move on its own.  The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence.  Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning.  Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or "clay-mation".  Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect.  Stop motion can also use sequential drawing in a similar manner to traditional animation, such as a flip book.  Stop motion using humans is sometimes referred to as pixilation or pixilate animation. | Question: Hairy Jeremy was a television show created in a style that, when it uses plasticine, is called what?', ['clay animation'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-2846'), ('Context: Paula YatesPaula Elizabeth Yates (24 April 1959  – 17 September 2000) was a Welsh television presenter and writer, best known for her work on two television programmes, The Tube and The Big Breakfast.  Early life  Born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, Yates  was brought up in a show business family. Her mother was Elaine Smith, a former showgirl, actress and writer of erotic novels, who used the stage name Heller Toren. Until late in her life, Yates believed her biological father to be Jess Yates, who hosted the ITV religious programme Stars on Sunday. Jess Yates and Elaine Smith were married from 1958 to 1975. Jess Yates was sixteen years older than his wife, and their marriage was unconventional.  In an unsettled childhood, Paula attended school at Rowen Primary School, Penrhos College, Ysgol Aberconwy. The Yates family ran the Deganwy Castle Hotel for a time, before moving to a large house in Rowen, Conwy. After the break-up of her parents\' marriage in 1975, Paula lived mostly with her mother, including periods in Malta and Mallorca where she was a pupil at Bellver International College, before returning to Britain.  Career  In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called "Natural Blonde" in the Record Mirror, shortly after posing for Penthouse magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme The Tube. She also appeared alongside friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof \'mockumentary\' on Bananarama.  In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin\'".   After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood.  Yates continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show The Tube. She became most notorious for her "on the bed" interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof.  On 27 October 1995, Yates appeared on the quiz programme Have I Got News for You and clashed with Ian Hislop over comments he had previously made about her breast enlargement surgery.  Yates referred to Hislop as "the sperm of the devil", to which Hislop replied, "Even your insults emanate from the genitals!"  Personal life  Yates met Geldof in the early days of the Boomtown Rats. They became a couple in 1976 when she flew to Paris to surprise him while the band was playing there. Their first daughter, Fifi Trixibelle, was born on 31 March 1983,  named Fifi after Bob\'s aunt Fifi and Trixibelle because Paula wanted a belle in the family.  After ten years together, they married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran acting as Geldof\'s best man. The couple then had two more daughters, Peaches Geldof  on 13 March 1989, and Pixie Geldof on 17 September 1990.  Yates first met Michael Hutchence in a 1985 interview on Channel 4\'s rock magazine programme The Tube.  During this appearance on The Tube, Yates was reportedly asked to leave Hutchence alone by the road manager of INXS when Paula walked up to him and said, "I\'m going to have that boy." Paula was unmoved and began to show up at INXS gigs everywhere for the next few years...she even brought her daughter (Fifi Geldof).  Yates maintained irregular contact with Hutchence during the intervening nine years and their affair had been underway long before the Big Breakfast interview.  In February 1995, Yates left Geldof.  Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996. Yates\'s daughter with Hutchence, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence (known as \'Tiger\') was born on 22 July 1996.   On 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in a hotel room in Sydney.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

All of these buildings are used for offices for Church departments and general leadership.  West of Temple Square is the Family History Library — the world’s largest genealogical facility — and the Museum of Church History and Art.  North of Temple Square sits the Conference Center — a 21,000-seat auditorium, one of the largest in the world. It is used for semiannual meetings broadcast worldwide for the entire Church membership, as well as frequent closed-circuit conferences broadcast to specific groups of members in different parts of the world.

Strauss: Also Sprach Zarathustra  Symphonic poem  A symphonic poem or tone poem is a piece of orchestral music in a single continuous section (a movement) in which the content of a poem, a story or novel, a painting, a landscape or another (non-musical) source is illustrated or evoked. The term was first applied by Hungarian composer Franz Liszt to his 13 works in this vein. In its aesthetic objectives, the symphonic poem is in some ways related to opera; whilst it does not use a sung text, it seeks, like opera, a union of music and drama.[1][2]  While many symphonic poems may compare in size and scale to symphonic movements (or even reach the length of an entire symphony), they are unlike traditional classical symphonic movements, in that their music is intended to inspire listeners to imagine or consider scenes, images, specific ideas or moods, and not to focus on following traditional patterns of musical form (e.g. sonata form). This intention to inspire listeners was a direct consequence of Romanticism, which encouraged literary, pictorial and dramatic associations in music. Musical works that attempt to inspire listeners in this way are often referred to as program music, while music that has no such associations may be called absolute music.  Some piano and chamber works, such as Arnold Schoenberg\'s string sextet Verkl�rte Nacht, have similarities with symphonic poems in their overall intent and effect. However, the term symphonic poem is generally accepted to refer to orchestral works.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Tartar sauce has a rough consistency and chopped hard-boiled eggs, olives and horseradish are also sometimes added to the sauce. Dijon mustard is often used as an emulsifier and vinegar is generally added for a sharper flavor. This sauce can be prepare several hours before and stored for up to 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.  Tartare sauce appears to have been invented by French as a sauce for steak tartare, a very well known French dish with thinly chopped raw steak and at the same point; the name was changed to tartar. Tartar sauce appears to date back to the 1800s although similar sauces have been made as far back as the 1600s.  In Britain, tartar sauce is based on mayonnaise made with eggs , white wine vinegar and oil, with the addition of chopped capers, chopped gherkins, a squeeze of lemon juice and some chopped parsley. This popular accompaniment to fish contains a number of vegetables and herbs, which are blended together with mayonnaise and then refrigerated. Homemade tartar sauce is simple and easy to prepare, tastes better and healthier than the readymade ones.  You can use any version of mayonnaise you save some calories that includes regular, light, low fat or even homemade mayonnaise . You can use which ever pickle is available with you. One simple rule of tartar sauce is that you should almost always be able to make the sauce without making a trip to the shop. Tartar sauce has tangy, creamy and rich flavor. The mayonnaise keeps the tartar sauce cool in flavor and taste which makes it suitable for fried foods. It can be used as a dipping sauce or can be served directly on food.  Tartar sauce can also be tossed with vegetables to make a simple salad. Fish and chips just aren’t the same without tartar sauce! Although there are a lot of different versions, tartar sauce is commonly made from mayonnaise, chopped capers and chopped dill pickles or pickled gherkins.  Tartar sauce also goes really well with a lot of other seafood dishes. The addition of some tartar sauce makes a quick and tasty fish dish. Few also like to add tartar sauce to things like crab cakes \xa0or other seafood patties in addition to serving it on the side or on top. Capers, gherkins and chives added to tartar sauce give a considered amount of sharpness in taste. Capers have an unusual flavor. It’s a sharp, piquant, salty taste with a pungent aroma all their own.  Capers are generally included a variety of pasta and piccata sauces, wine sauces, salad dressings, pizza fish, relishes, Mediterranean dishes etc. They can even be fried and then tossed into the dishes above for a crunchier, crispier flavor and texture. Whereas Chives are popularly used for culinary purposes as flavoring herb, and provide a somewhat milder flavor than those of its neighboring Allium species. Chives are one of the finest herbs of the French cuisine and are used with pancakes , soups, fish and\xa0 sandwiches.  Gherkins are a fruit similar in form and nutritional value to a cucumber . They are usually picked when 4 to 8\xa0cm (1 to 3 in) in length and pickled in jars or cans with vinegar (often flavored with herbs, particularly dill; hence, "dill pickle") or brine to resemble a pickled cucumber .  For preparing the smooth, creamy and delicious Tartar sauce, Mix the mayonnaise and the cream in a bowl. Add all the rest of the ingredients like finely chopped capers, chives, gherkins, hard boiled eggs , coarsely ground black pepper , salt to taste and mix all thoroughly.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission. Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics, and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing Liberal Party, or from a new group driven by | Question: Who was the female member of the SDP\'s \'Gang Of Four\'?', ['shirley williams'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2607'), ("Context: Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city ...Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city | Daily Mail Online  Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city  comments  Prague is one of Europe's architectural gems, with more knockout picture-postcard views than some entire countries. Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

Uploaded on Dec 27, 2011  Excerpt from the performance of Shostakovich's 10th Symphony by the Australian Youth Orchestra at the 2010 BBC Proms. Conducted by Sir Mark Elder.  Born: June 2, 1947 - Hexham, Northumberland, England  The English conductor, Mark Philip Elder, is the son of a dentist. As a youth he divulged talent both as a singer and instrumentalist, serving as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and as the first-chair bassoonist in the National Youth Orchestra. He studied music at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied music and was a choral scholar. He was later mentored by renowned British conductor and musicologist Edward Downes. Elder worked briefly in minor capacities at Glyndeboune and Covent Garden before gaining experience conducting Verdi operas as a regular conductor at the Sydney Opera House, Australia from 1972 to 1974. He returned to England in 1974. | Question: Born in Hexham in 1947, what is the profession of Mark Elder?", ['conducting'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5936'), ('Context: In addition to identifying rocks in the field, petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.

Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory.

In particular , it emphasizes the separation of prokaryotes into two groups , originally called Eubacteria ( now Bacteria ) and Archaebacteria ( now Archaea ) . Woese argued that , on the basis of differences in 16S rRNA genes , these two groups and the eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed genetic machinery , often called a progenote . To reflect these primary lines of descent , he treated each as a domain , divided into several different kingdoms .

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense. In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v.

Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification. | Question: What would someone who is civilly disobedient do in court?', ['inform the jury and the public', 'inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances', 'plead not guilty'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6835'), ('Context: The Saint is an ITC mystery spy thriller television series that aired in the United Kingdom on ITV between 1962 and 1969 .

Strauss: Also Sprach Zarathustra  Symphonic poem  A symphonic poem or tone poem is a piece of orchestral music in a single continuous section (a movement) in which the content of a poem, a story or novel, a painting, a landscape or another (non-musical) source is illustrated or evoked. The term was first applied by Hungarian composer Franz Liszt to his 13 works in this vein. In its aesthetic objectives, the symphonic poem is in some ways related to opera; whilst it does not use a sung text, it seeks, like opera, a union of music and drama.[1][2]  While many symphonic poems may compare in size and scale to symphonic movements (or even reach the length of an entire symphony), they are unlike traditional classical symphonic movements, in that their music is intended to inspire listeners to imagine or consider scenes, images, specific ideas or moods, and not to focus on following traditional patterns of musical form (e.g. sonata form). This intention to inspire listeners was a direct consequence of Romanticism, which encouraged literary, pictorial and dramatic associations in music. Musical works that attempt to inspire listeners in this way are often referred to as program music, while music that has no such associations may be called absolute music.  Some piano and chamber works, such as Arnold Schoenberg\'s string sextet Verkl�rte Nacht, have similarities with symphonic poems in their overall intent and effect. However, the term symphonic poem is generally accepted to refer to orchestral works.

They are also commonly referred to as the Antarctic locus fly, and are blamed for the 1850s and 1972/3 vine plagues. These almost microscopic, pale yellow sap-sucking insects , related to aphids , feed on the roots and leaves of grapevines (depending on the phylloxera genetic strain). On Vitis vinifera L. , the resulting deformations on roots ("nodosities" and "tuberosities") and secondary fungal infections can girdle roots, gradually cutting off the flow of nutrients and water to the vine. Nymphs also form protective galls on the undersides of grapevine leaves of some Vitis species and overwinter under the bark or on the vine roots; these leaf galls are typically only found on the leaves of American vines.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Biology of Phylloxera  The phylloxera louse has a complex life-cycle of up to eighteen stages that is divisible into four principal forms: sexual form, leaf form, root form, and winged form.  The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine\'s trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces four to seven more generations of eggs (which are also capable of parthenogenetic reproduction) each summer. These offspring spread out to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge the following spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form (otherwise, they perform the same role without wings). These nymphs start the cycle over again by either remaining on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same. [1]  Many attempts have been made to interrupt this life cycle to eradicate phylloxera, but the louse has proven to be extremely adaptable, as no one stage of the life cycle is solely dependent upon another for the propagation of the species.  \xa0 Fighting the "phylloxera plague"  In the late 19th century the phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards for wine grapes in Europe, most notably in France . Phylloxera was introduced to Europe when avid botanists in Victorian England collected specimens of American vines in the 1850s. Because phylloxera is native to North America, the native grape species there are at least partially resistant. By contrast, the European wine grape Vitis vinifera is very susceptible to the insect. The epidemic devastated vineyards in Britain and then moved to the mainland, destroying most of the European grape growing industry. In 1863, the first vines began to deteriorate inexplicably in the southern Rhône region of France.

In a career spanning five decades, Hackman has been nominated for five Academy Awards, winning Best Actor in The French Connection and Best Supporting Actor in Unforgiven. In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Tartar sauce has a rough consistency and chopped hard-boiled eggs, olives and horseradish are also sometimes added to the sauce. Dijon mustard is often used as an emulsifier and vinegar is generally added for a sharper flavor. This sauce can be prepare several hours before and stored for up to 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.  Tartare sauce appears to have been invented by French as a sauce for steak tartare, a very well known French dish with thinly chopped raw steak and at the same point; the name was changed to tartar. Tartar sauce appears to date back to the 1800s although similar sauces have been made as far back as the 1600s.  In Britain, tartar sauce is based on mayonnaise made with eggs , white wine vinegar and oil, with the addition of chopped capers, chopped gherkins, a squeeze of lemon juice and some chopped parsley. This popular accompaniment to fish contains a number of vegetables and herbs, which are blended together with mayonnaise and then refrigerated. Homemade tartar sauce is simple and easy to prepare, tastes better and healthier than the readymade ones.  You can use any version of mayonnaise you save some calories that includes regular, light, low fat or even homemade mayonnaise . You can use which ever pickle is available with you. One simple rule of tartar sauce is that you should almost always be able to make the sauce without making a trip to the shop. Tartar sauce has tangy, creamy and rich flavor. The mayonnaise keeps the tartar sauce cool in flavor and taste which makes it suitable for fried foods. It can be used as a dipping sauce or can be served directly on food.  Tartar sauce can also be tossed with vegetables to make a simple salad. Fish and chips just aren’t the same without tartar sauce! Although there are a lot of different versions, tartar sauce is commonly made from mayonnaise, chopped capers and chopped dill pickles or pickled gherkins.  Tartar sauce also goes really well with a lot of other seafood dishes. The addition of some tartar sauce makes a quick and tasty fish dish. Few also like to add tartar sauce to things like crab cakes \xa0or other seafood patties in addition to serving it on the side or on top. Capers, gherkins and chives added to tartar sauce give a considered amount of sharpness in taste. Capers have an unusual flavor. It’s a sharp, piquant, salty taste with a pungent aroma all their own.  Capers are generally included a variety of pasta and piccata sauces, wine sauces, salad dressings, pizza fish, relishes, Mediterranean dishes etc. They can even be fried and then tossed into the dishes above for a crunchier, crispier flavor and texture. Whereas Chives are popularly used for culinary purposes as flavoring herb, and provide a somewhat milder flavor than those of its neighboring Allium species. Chives are one of the finest herbs of the French cuisine and are used with pancakes , soups, fish and\xa0 sandwiches.  Gherkins are a fruit similar in form and nutritional value to a cucumber . They are usually picked when 4 to 8\xa0cm (1 to 3 in) in length and pickled in jars or cans with vinegar (often flavored with herbs, particularly dill; hence, "dill pickle") or brine to resemble a pickled cucumber .  For preparing the smooth, creamy and delicious Tartar sauce, Mix the mayonnaise and the cream in a bowl. Add all the rest of the ingredients like finely chopped capers, chives, gherkins, hard boiled eggs , coarsely ground black pepper , salt to taste and mix all thoroughly.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission. Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics, and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing Liberal Party, or from a new group driven by | Question: Who was the female member of the SDP\'s \'Gang Of Four\'?', ['shirley williams'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2607'), ("Context: Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city ...Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city | Daily Mail Online  Prague: Six things you must do in the Czech capital city  comments  Prague is one of Europe's architectural gems, with more knockout picture-postcard views than some entire countries. Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

Uploaded on Dec 27, 2011  Excerpt from the performance of Shostakovich's 10th Symphony by the Australian Youth Orchestra at the 2010 BBC Proms. Conducted by Sir Mark Elder.  Born: June 2, 1947 - Hexham, Northumberland, England  The English conductor, Mark Philip Elder, is the son of a dentist. As a youth he divulged talent both as a singer and instrumentalist, serving as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and as the first-chair bassoonist in the National Youth Orchestra. He studied music at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied music and was a choral scholar. He was later mentored by renowned British conductor and musicologist Edward Downes. Elder worked briefly in minor capacities at Glyndeboune and Covent Garden before gaining experience conducting Verdi operas as a regular conductor at the Sydney Opera House, Australia from 1972 to 1974. He returned to England in 1974. | Question: Born in Hexham in 1947, what is the profession of Mark Elder?", ['conducting'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5936'), ('Context: In addition to identifying rocks in the field, petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.

Woese argued that , on the basis of differences in 16S rRNA genes , these two groups and the eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed genetic machinery , often called a progenote . To reflect these primary lines of descent , he treated each as a domain , divided into several different kingdoms .

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense. In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v.

Mrs McCarthy is a frequent gossip -- though claims she is not -- and often at odds with Lady Felicia , although she and Lady Felicia eventually admit to being close friends . She is married , but leaves her husband after he returns from having lived with another woman following the war .   Lady Felicia Montague née Windermere -- Nancy Carroll ( 2013 -- 2018 ) : a bored socialite and Countess , apparently from an old recusant family , with a roving eye when her husband , Monty , is away .

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

He is most famous for his work on television as Johnny Carson\'s sidekick, announcer, and second banana on The Tonight Show from 1962 through 1992. He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.

JaneFonda  Nine to Five Movie - The 80s Movies RewindNine to Five Movie - The 80s Movies Rewind  More Trivia from Nine to Five  Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) is a recently divorced woman whose husband has left for a younger woman, she now finds herself in a small apartment and working as a secretary at the huge Consolodated Corporation.  The problem is, Judy has never worked a day in her life - therefore, simple tasks such as filing, answering telephones and especially using the Xerox machine scare her witless!  Also at Consolodated is the efficient Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin), a widow with four kids, who has been with the company for 12 years. Violet works harder and better than anyone there, but never gets promoted higher because of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman), the company\'s chauvanist boss, who is despised by all his female employees.  Hart\'s personal secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton), has to suffer constant unwanted sexual harrassment from her boss, who has managed to convince everyone at Consolodated that Doralee is his mistress, which probably explains why all the other women will barely even speak to Doralee.  The trio of Judy, Violet and Doralee become firm friends and the three of them even jokingly fantasize together about how they\'d like to bump off Hart!  However, when a simple mistake leads to Hart temporarily ending up in hospital and he threatens to have them all thrown in jail, events spiral way out of control... and Hart finds himself a prisoner in his own home, as the three women keep him tied up while they plan to get themselves out of this mess and get back at Hart... for good!  Verdict?  "Nine To Five" was released right at the end of 1980, but still managed to become one of the year\'s highest grossing films. Part of the reason it was so popular was undoubtedly due to the fact that the film focuses on women being treated appallingly in the workplace by a man and audiences who could identify with that just loved seeing them get even!  The three leading ladies of "Nine To Five" are all absolutely perfect in their roles, with Lily Tomlin particularly terrific as the trio\'s ringleader, Violet. Country-and-western superstar Dolly Parton made an unforgettable debut as Doralee and it was great to see Jane Fonda take a break from serious, dramatic work to have a bit of comedy fun, as timid Judy!  Dabney Coleman also gives a great performance as Franklin Hart, the boss from hell, referred to by the main characters as a "sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"! Special mention must go to Elizabeth Wilson as Roz Keith, the office gossip always trying to get into Hart\'s good books.

It was released on April 19, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was her final studio album with the record company, marking the end of a 25-year recording history. Madonna started working on the album in early 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, The Neptunes and Nate "Danja" Hills. The album has an overall R&B vibe, while remaining a dance-pop record at its core. The Pet Shop Boys were also asked to collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros., but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation.  Madonna became interested in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but the basis of the development was Pharrell Williams\' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the process of developing the album.  Madonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art, and call it the same, but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial. She instead named the album "Hard Candy", which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness. Critical reaction to the album were generally favorable, though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market. On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best-selling album worldwide of 2008. The album has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide.  Three singles were released from the album. The first, "4 Minutes", was a worldwide success, topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna\'s 37th Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit. Other singles released were "Give It 2 Me" and "Miles Away". To promote the album, Madonna went on a small promotional tour, where she played in three cities in small venues. The album received the majority of its promotion from the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, which went on to become the highest grossing tour ever by a solo female artist.  Background and development  In February 2007, Timbaland said that he was working with Madonna for her upcoming eleventh studio album.  It was Madonna\'s last studio album for Warner Bros. Records, and following the release of a greatest hits collection (Celebration), she would join Live Nation Artists, a new initiative launched by concert promoter Live Nation. The 10-year deal with Live Nation encompassed all of Madonna\'s future music and music-related businesses, including the exploitation of the Madonna brand, new studio albums, touring, merchandising, fan clubs/Web sites, DVDs, music-related television and film projects and associated sponsorship agreements. In August 2007, Timbaland spoke about the development of the album to MTV News. Together he and Justin Timberlake were confirmed to have worked on the album with Madonna and said that they wrote ten songs for her. Songs confirmed to have been developed were "La, La" and "Candy Shop", which was written by Pharrell Williams.  Timbaland added,  "Me and Justin did the records. [Madonna\'s] got a hot album. Her album is up there with Justin\'s album. [...] Ah, man, there\'s this one song, we taking it back to \'You must be my luck-eee starrrr!\' ... Remember \'Ugly\' by Bubba Sparxxx?

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .  Vanessa atalanta  +1  -40  The table above shows the occurrence (distribution) and abundance (population) trends, using information from The State of the UK's Butterflies 2015 (Fox, 2015). Any UK BAP status is taken from the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) (2007 review).  Habitat  This butterfly can be found almost anywhere, from the seashore and town gardens, to the tops of the highest mountains.  Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.

JaneFonda  Nine to Five Movie - The 80s Movies RewindNine to Five Movie - The 80s Movies Rewind  More Trivia from Nine to Five  Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) is a recently divorced woman whose husband has left for a younger woman, she now finds herself in a small apartment and working as a secretary at the huge Consolodated Corporation.  The problem is, Judy has never worked a day in her life - therefore, simple tasks such as filing, answering telephones and especially using the Xerox machine scare her witless!  Also at Consolodated is the efficient Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin), a widow with four kids, who has been with the company for 12 years. Violet works harder and better than anyone there, but never gets promoted higher because of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman), the company\'s chauvanist boss, who is despised by all his female employees.  Hart\'s personal secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton), has to suffer constant unwanted sexual harrassment from her boss, who has managed to convince everyone at Consolodated that Doralee is his mistress, which probably explains why all the other women will barely even speak to Doralee.  The trio of Judy, Violet and Doralee become firm friends and the three of them even jokingly fantasize together about how they\'d like to bump off Hart!  However, when a simple mistake leads to Hart temporarily ending up in hospital and he threatens to have them all thrown in jail, events spiral way out of control... and Hart finds himself a prisoner in his own home, as the three women keep him tied up while they plan to get themselves out of this mess and get back at Hart... for good!  Verdict?  "Nine To Five" was released right at the end of 1980, but still managed to become one of the year\'s highest grossing films. Part of the reason it was so popular was undoubtedly due to the fact that the film focuses on women being treated appallingly in the workplace by a man and audiences who could identify with that just loved seeing them get even!  The three leading ladies of "Nine To Five" are all absolutely perfect in their roles, with Lily Tomlin particularly terrific as the trio\'s ringleader, Violet. Country-and-western superstar Dolly Parton made an unforgettable debut as Doralee and it was great to see Jane Fonda take a break from serious, dramatic work to have a bit of comedy fun, as timid Judy!  Dabney Coleman also gives a great performance as Franklin Hart, the boss from hell, referred to by the main characters as a "sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"!

It was released on April 19, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was her final studio album with the record company, marking the end of a 25-year recording history. Madonna started working on the album in early 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, The Neptunes and Nate "Danja" Hills. The album has an overall R&B vibe, while remaining a dance-pop record at its core. The Pet Shop Boys were also asked to collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros., but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation.  Madonna became interested in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but the basis of the development was Pharrell Williams\' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the process of developing the album.  Madonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art, and call it the same, but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial. She instead named the album "Hard Candy", which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness. Critical reaction to the album were generally favorable, though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market. On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best-selling album worldwide of 2008. The album has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide.  Three singles were released from the album. The first, "4 Minutes", was a worldwide success, topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna\'s 37th Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000.

We want you to know what is in our food and help you make the best decisions for you and your family.\xa0  Even though the FDA, USDA, World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association have concluded that products containing genetically engineered ingredients are safe, Del Monte remains committed to meeting evolving consumer preferences and continues to explore Non-GMO ingredient alternatives where possible.  All of the fruit, vegetables and tomatoes in Del Monte products have always come from traditional breeding techniques and are not the result of any modern genetic engineering, or genetic modification (Non-GMO). 70 of our best-selling vegetable and tomato products are completely Non-GMO and can be found by looking for the Non-GMO label on the product.\xa0  Certain Del Monte products do contain added ingredients (like sweeteners or flavorings) that have been derived from genetically engineered corn or soybeans. Del Monte made a significant investment to convert these added ingredients to be Non-GMO.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have, according to the Sunday Mercury, sold more than 100 million records.  When MTV dawned in the early 1980s, it changed the face of popular music forever, and the British rock group Duran Duran was the first act to take full advantage of its possibilities. The five-member band of young, sculpted faces often adorned with make-up and expensive clothes, saw in the music video the perfect vehicle for propelling them beyond obscurity and their musical abilities to fame, fortune, and good times. Combining the sounds of 1970s British punk and the more upbeat, danceable rhythms of disco, Duran Duran began producing clean, sparkling (if not critically acclaimed), pop tunes. But what set them apart immediately were their videos: somewhat surreal escapist fantasies that took the self-styled playboys to such far-flung locales as Sri Lanka and Antigua. Screaming, record-buying, television-watching teen-age girls everywhere ate it up-and nobody could have predicted it better than the band members themselves. "Video to us is like stereo was to Pink Floyd," said Duran Duran keyboa rdist Nick Rhodes. "It was new, it was just happening. And we saw we could do a lot with it." But, with more than 25 years together and more than 70 million albums sold, the group has proven its significance well beyond the video screen.  While the conservative rock press liked to downplay the success of Duran Duran because of their obvious vanity and lack of attention to "serious" music, it should be noted that some of rock and roll\'s most time-honored heroes, such as Elvis Presley and even a few members of the Beatles, were never accused of being serious musicians. Success in pop music has always depended upon image at least as much as the music itself. And "serious music" is not necessarily for everyone as Rolling Stone\'s James Henke realized when he referred to Duran Duran\'s eager fans as "young girls who were glued to their television sets watching MTV every waking hour. These girls had little use for the Clash\'s left-wing politics, or the ranting and raving of that weird-looking Elvis Costello. But Duran Duran, now they were something else. Five extremely good-looking young men. Dream dates."  Duran Duran began coming together in 1978 (some sources say 1977) in the Midlands city of Birmingham, where Rhodes and guitarist John Taylor started performing with a variety of bandmates. The group, which takes its name from a character in the 1968 film Barbarella, became complete in 1980 when Simon Le Bon, a drop-out drama student, showed up one day in pink, leopard-skin leotards and said he wanted to sing in the band. Le Bon joined Rhodes, John Taylor (who switched to b ass), drummer Roger Taylor, and guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related), and the quintet began performing in Birmingham, most frequently at a club called Rum Runners which had become established as the home of England\'s burgeoning New Roma ntic scene. "Donning the foppish clothes of the movement and playing a slick, if superficial, brand of dance-pop, the band was tailor-made for the style obsessed New Romantics," said the Encyclopedia of Rock.  Duran Duran quickly became the headliners of that movement, playing at large clubs and festivals throughout England, and in early 1981 they released their first single, "Planet Earth," which went to number 12 on the United Kingdom charts.

Its area is roughly equivalent with the historical territory of Outer Mongolia, and that term is sometimes used to refer to the current state. It is bordered by China to the south and Russia to the north. While it does not share a border with Kazakhstan, Mongolia is separated from Kazakhstan by only . Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to about 45% of the country's population.  At 1564116 km2, Mongolia is the 19th largest and the most sparsely populated fully sovereign country in the world, with a population of around 3 million people. It is also the world's second-largest landlocked country. The country contains very little arable land, as much of its area is covered by grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south.  Approximately 30% of the population is nomadic or semi-nomadic; horse culture is still integral. The majority of its population are Buddhists. The non-religious population is the second largest group. Islam is the dominant religion among ethnic Kazakhs. The majority of the state's citizens are of Mongol ethnicity, although Kazakhs, Tuvans, and other minorities also live in the country, especially in the west. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade groups.  The area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Rouran, the Turkic Khaganate, and others. In 1206, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire, and his grandson Kublai Khan conquered China to establish the Yuan dynasty. After the collapse of the Yuan, the Mongols retreated to Mongolia and resumed their earlier pattern of factional conflict, except during the era of Dayan Khan and Tumen Zasagt Khan. In the 16th century, Tibetan Buddhism began to spread in Mongolia, being further led by the Manchu-founded Qing dynasty, which absorbed the country in the 17th century. By the early 1900s, almost one-third of the adult male population were Buddhist monks.    During the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongols established the Temporary Government of Khalkha on November 30, 1911. This was before the abdication of the last Qing emperor and the establishment of the Republic of China. On December 29, 1911, Mongolia declared independence from the Qing dynasty; the National Revolution of 1911 ended over 200 years of Qing rule, though it was not until the Revolution of 1921 that de facto independence from the Republic of China was firmly established.       Shortly thereafter, the country came under the control of the Soviet Union, which had aided its independence from China. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was declared as a Soviet satellite state. After the anti-Communist revolutions of 1989, Mongolia conducted its own peaceful democratic revolution in early 1990. This led to a multi-party system, a new constitution of 1992, and transition to a market economy.  History   Prehistory and antiquity   Homo erectus inhabited Mongolia from 850,000 years ago.

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)

It was the most serious scandal in the country’s history prior to the Watergate affair of the Nixon administration in the 1970s.  And this controversy was named for an oil reserve near a rock formation north of Casper , Wyo., that looked just like a teapot.  Events that led to the scandal began decades before when government and U.S. Navy officials, contemplating a new, global presence, realized they needed a fuel supply that was more reliable and more portable than coal .  During the Theodore Roosevelt presidency early in the 20th century, Department of the Navy officials aspired for an American navy that could sail all the world’s oceans, demonstrating the country’s newly found imperial powers. The U. S. Navy, bound by weight limitations with coal-fired ships, resorted to building coal-fueling stations around the world.  They watched carefully as other nations began development of petroleum-powered ships. Beginning in 1909, during the Taft administration, Navy administrators decided to convert the fleet to the more efficient petroleum. Ships would have no need for coaling stations. Once fueled, the petroleum-powered ships had far greater range.  The USS Wyoming , a battleship initially launched in 1900, became the first ship in the fleet to be converted to oil power in 1909. (The vessel was later renamed the USS Cheyenne when the new battleship USS Wyoming was launched in 1910.), As more ships were converted from coal, Navy officials grew more concerned about the long-term availability of oil. What would happen if oil were to run out? The Navy would be paralyzed.  Consequently, Navy administrators asked Congress to set aside federally owned lands in places where known oil deposits most likely existed. These “naval petroleum reserves” would not be drilled unless a national emergency made it necessary. One of the three petroleum reserves set aside was near Salt Creek in northern Natrona County in a place named for an unusual rock formation nearby—Teapot Dome. A dome is a geological formation that traps oil underground between impervious layers of rock, with the upper layer bent upward to form a dome.  Oilmen throughout the West coveted the opportunity to drill within these federally owned reserves. Soon after Republican Warren G. Harding was elected president in 1920, he appointed his poker-playing friend, U.S. Sen. Albert Fall, to be his secretary of Interior.  Fall, a rancher and New Mexico’s first U.S. senator, accepted the cabinet post. Within a few weeks, he convinced President Harding to allow transfer of the naval petroleum reserves from the Navy to the Department of the Interior, arguing that the department was “better able” to oversee the protection of these areas where oil was not to be produced, but kept in case of emergency.  What resulted became known as the Teapot Dome scandal, but even though the scandal gained its name from a Wyoming place, the wrongdoers were from elsewhere.  Secretary Fall, once the Teapot Dome oil field was under his control, made secret deals with two prominent oilmen, Edward Doheny and Harry Sinclair. Both men, close friends of Fall, paid him bribes to authorize them to drill in the three naval petroleum reserves—contrary to the letter and spirit of the law.

The group\'s emergence was perfectly timed; Radiohead had just released the overly cerebral Kid A, while Oasis had ditched two founding members and embraced psychedelic experimentation on Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. Audiences were hungry for a fresh-faced rock band with big aspirations and an even bigger sound, and Coldplay were more than happy to take the reins. Parachutes went multi-platinum in several countries and earned the band its first Grammy, but Coldplay continued to grow into the 2000s, topping their debut album\'s success with higher record sales and an increased public profile.  Chris Martin (vocals/piano), Jonny Buckland (guitar), Will Champion (drums), and Guy Berryman (bass) were all born into musical households. Martin, the eldest of five, began playing the piano as a young child and later took solace in the work of Tom Waits. Buckland, on the other hand, grew up with the heavy guitar sounds of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Scotland native Berryman preferred funk to indie rock, thereby leaving him to play bass, while multi-instrumentalist Champion didn\'t plan to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay\'s lineup. The bandmates came together in 1996 while attending the University College of London, and the Safety EP was issued shortly after their first gig at a Manchester festival for unsigned bands. The release only saw 500 pressings, as did the subsequent Brothers & Sisters EP. Nevertheless, it was enough to win the band a U.K. deal with Parlophone Records in April 1999, and the five-track Blue Room EP arrived that fall. With nods from the media, Coldplay were hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simple acoustics and charming personas.  Parlophone ushered Coldplay into Parr St. Studios in Liverpool, where they recorded the bulk of their debut album. Parachutes was released in July 2000 and became a swift hit on the strength of four U.K. singles, several of which enjoyed popularity in America as well. With "Yellow" climbing the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, Parachutes was released in the U.S. in November, where its sales soon rivaled -- and eventually surpassed -- those in the U.K.  Riding on the strength of their universally popular debut, Coldplay headed back into the studio in fall 2001 to work on a sophomore album. They emerged with A Rush of Blood to the Head, releasing the album worldwide in August 2002 and embarking on a global concert tour soon after. "The Scientist" enjoyed regular radio rotation, while both "Clocks" and "In My Place" won Grammy Awards.  Coldplay began recording material for a third album in early 2004. Previously recorded material with longtime producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while Danton Supple (Morrissey, the Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&Y. "Speed of Sound" marked the band\'s first single from their long-awaited third effort in spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping charts around the world and selling more than eight million copies during its first year.  Such success put Coldplay on the same commercial level as U2, and the quartet retreated to the studio in late 2006 to work with famed producer Brian Eno (who had teamed up with U2 several times in the past). Recording sessions with Eno were completed within one year, followed by several months of mixing and growing anticipation from the band\'s audience. Viva la Vida -- also known by its extended name, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends -- ultimately arrived in June 2008. Worldwide sales for the album had approached six million by November, when Coldplay released several new recordings (including a collaboration with hip-hop mogul Jay-Z) as part of the Prospekt\'s March EP.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England. For the exterior filming, the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Buckinghamshire was used instead of a hotel.

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000.

We want you to know what is in our food and help you make the best decisions for you and your family.\xa0  Even though the FDA, USDA, World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association have concluded that products containing genetically engineered ingredients are safe, Del Monte remains committed to meeting evolving consumer preferences and continues to explore Non-GMO ingredient alternatives where possible.  All of the fruit, vegetables and tomatoes in Del Monte products have always come from traditional breeding techniques and are not the result of any modern genetic engineering, or genetic modification (Non-GMO). 70 of our best-selling vegetable and tomato products are completely Non-GMO and can be found by looking for the Non-GMO label on the product.\xa0  Certain Del Monte products do contain added ingredients (like sweeteners or flavorings) that have been derived from genetically engineered corn or soybeans. Del Monte made a significant investment to convert these added ingredients to be Non-GMO. As a result, we plan to convert the majority of our vegetables and fruit cups and most of our tomato products to “Non-GMO” by the end of our 2016 pack season (Sept/Oct 2016).  In 2016, we worked with the USDA to verify our sweet corn products as non-genetically modified resulting in the USDA certification, "USDA Process Verified Non-GE/GMO".\xa0\xa0Del Monte is the first consumer products company ever to meet USDA’s strict criteria to qualify for their Non-GMO process verification program. This process goes to great lengths to ensure that Del Monte’s sweet corn is not mutated or impacted by “drift” pollination that can occur when our specialty sweet corn is grown in areas near genetically modified commodity corn. Look for the USDA Process Verified Non-GE/GMO claim on our corn products some time later this year.  For more information, please visit FAQs .  Non-BPA Products  Del Monte’s top priority is the quality and safety of our products.\xa0 For more than 40 years, BPA has been approved by the FDA for use in food contact applications, and can coatings containing BPA have played an essential part in food preservation.  In response to growing consumer and customer preference, we have been working closely with can manufacturers and lining suppliers to approve non-BPA internal can lining alternatives that meet both food safety and consumer quality requirements. Given the critical role in ensuring product safety and preserving quality, any replacement for BPA must first pass rigorous safety and quality testing before we will accept it for use in our products. If an alternative proves safe and effective in a particular application, we will pursue it.  For instance, we started transitioning to Non-BPA linings back in 2009 for some of our vegetable, fruit and tomato products where the new linings were proven safe and effective through test pack, shelf-life studies, and analytical testing.\xa0\xa0Starting with the 2016 fresh pack production, which begins | Question: From which country does the food brand Del Monte originate ?', ['usa', 'us'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7156'), ("Context: Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" of the United States. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100 and have, according to the Sunday Mercury, sold more than 100 million records.  When MTV dawned in the early 1980s, it changed the face of popular music forever, and the British rock group Duran Duran was the first act to take full advantage of its possibilities. The five-member band of young, sculpted faces often adorned with make-up and expensive clothes, saw in the music video the perfect vehicle for propelling them beyond obscurity and their musical abilities to fame, fortune, and good times. Combining the sounds of 1970s British punk and the more upbeat, danceable rhythms of disco, Duran Duran began producing clean, sparkling (if not critically acclaimed), pop tunes. But what set them apart immediately were their videos: somewhat surreal escapist fantasies that took the self-styled playboys to such far-flung locales as Sri Lanka and Antigua. Screaming, record-buying, television-watching teen-age girls everywhere ate it up-and nobody could have predicted it better than the band members themselves. "Video to us is like stereo was to Pink Floyd," said Duran Duran keyboa rdist Nick Rhodes. "It was new, it was just happening. And we saw we could do a lot with it." But, with more than 25 years together and more than 70 million albums sold, the group has proven its significance well beyond the video screen.  While the conservative rock press liked to downplay the success of Duran Duran because of their obvious vanity and lack of attention to "serious" music, it should be noted that some of rock and roll\'s most time-honored heroes, such as Elvis Presley and even a few members of the Beatles, were never accused of being serious musicians. Success in pop music has always depended upon image at least as much as the music itself. And "serious music" is not necessarily for everyone as Rolling Stone\'s James Henke realized when he referred to Duran Duran\'s eager fans as "young girls who were glued to their television sets watching MTV every waking hour. These girls had little use for the Clash\'s left-wing politics, or the ranting and raving of that weird-looking Elvis Costello. But Duran Duran, now they were something else. Five extremely good-looking young men. Dream dates."  Duran Duran began coming together in 1978 (some sources say 1977) in the Midlands city of Birmingham, where Rhodes and guitarist John Taylor started performing with a variety of bandmates. The group, which takes its name from a character in the 1968 film Barbarella, became complete in 1980 when Simon Le Bon, a drop-out drama student, showed up one day in pink, leopard-skin leotards and said he wanted to sing in the band. Le Bon joined Rhodes, John Taylor (who switched to b ass), drummer Roger Taylor, and guitarist Andy Taylor (none of the Taylors are related), and the quintet began performing in Birmingham, most frequently at a club called Rum Runners which had become established as the home of England\'s burgeoning New Roma ntic scene. "Donning the foppish clothes of the movement and playing a slick, if superficial, brand of dance-pop, the band was tailor-made for the style obsessed New Romantics," said the Encyclopedia of Rock.  Duran Duran quickly became the headliners of that movement, playing at large clubs and festivals throughout England, and in early 1981 they released their first single, "Planet Earth," which went to number 12 on the United Kingdom charts.

Later emperors would gain 16 Chinese prefectures by fueling a proxy war that led to the collapse of the Tang Dynasty.

Its area is roughly equivalent with the historical territory of Outer Mongolia, and that term is sometimes used to refer to the current state. It is bordered by China to the south and Russia to the north. While it does not share a border with Kazakhstan, Mongolia is separated from Kazakhstan by only . Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to about 45% of the country's population.  At 1564116 km2, Mongolia is the 19th largest and the most sparsely populated fully sovereign country in the world, with a population of around 3 million people. It is also the world's second-largest landlocked country. The country contains very little arable land, as much of its area is covered by grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to the south.  Approximately 30% of the population is nomadic or semi-nomadic; horse culture is still integral. The majority of its population are Buddhists. The non-religious population is the second largest group. Islam is the dominant religion among ethnic Kazakhs. The majority of the state's citizens are of Mongol ethnicity, although Kazakhs, Tuvans, and other minorities also live in the country, especially in the west. Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade groups.  The area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Rouran, the Turkic Khaganate, and others. In 1206, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire, and his grandson Kublai Khan conquered China to establish the Yuan dynasty. After the collapse of the Yuan, the Mongols retreated to Mongolia and resumed their earlier pattern of factional conflict, except during the era of Dayan Khan and Tumen Zasagt Khan. In the 16th century, Tibetan Buddhism began to spread in Mongolia, being further led by the Manchu-founded Qing dynasty, which absorbed the country in the 17th century. By the early 1900s, almost one-third of the adult male population were Buddhist monks.    During the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongols established the Temporary Government of Khalkha on November 30, 1911. This was before the abdication of the last Qing emperor and the establishment of the Republic of China. On December 29, 1911, Mongolia declared independence from the Qing dynasty; the National Revolution of 1911 ended over 200 years of Qing rule, though it was not until the Revolution of 1921 that de facto independence from the Republic of China was firmly established.       Shortly thereafter, the country came under the control of the Soviet Union, which had aided its independence from China. In 1924, the Mongolian People's Republic was declared as a Soviet satellite state. After the anti-Communist revolutions of 1989, Mongolia conducted its own peaceful democratic revolution in early 1990. This led to a multi-party system, a new constitution of 1992, and transition to a market economy.  History   Prehistory and antiquity   Homo erectus inhabited Mongolia from 850,000 years ago.

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)

It was the most serious scandal in the country’s history prior to the Watergate affair of the Nixon administration in the 1970s.  And this controversy was named for an oil reserve near a rock formation north of Casper , Wyo., that looked just like a teapot.  Events that led to the scandal began decades before when government and U.S. Navy officials, contemplating a new, global presence, realized they needed a fuel supply that was more reliable and more portable than coal .  During the Theodore Roosevelt presidency early in the 20th century, Department of the Navy officials aspired for an American navy that could sail all the world’s oceans, demonstrating the country’s newly found imperial powers. The U. S. Navy, bound by weight limitations with coal-fired ships, resorted to building coal-fueling stations around the world.  They watched carefully as other nations began development of petroleum-powered ships. Beginning in 1909, during the Taft administration, Navy administrators decided to convert the fleet to the more efficient petroleum. Ships would have no need for coaling stations. Once fueled, the petroleum-powered ships had far greater range.  The USS Wyoming , a battleship initially launched in 1900, became the first ship in the fleet to be converted to oil power in 1909. (The vessel was later renamed the USS Cheyenne when the new battleship USS Wyoming was launched in 1910.), As more ships were converted from coal, Navy officials grew more concerned about the long-term availability of oil. What would happen if oil were to run out? The Navy would be paralyzed.  Consequently, Navy administrators asked Congress to set aside federally owned lands in places where known oil deposits most likely existed. These “naval petroleum reserves” would not be drilled unless a national emergency made it necessary. One of the three petroleum reserves set aside was near Salt Creek in northern Natrona County in a place named for an unusual rock formation nearby—Teapot Dome. A dome is a geological formation that traps oil underground between impervious layers of rock, with the upper layer bent upward to form a dome.  Oilmen throughout the West coveted the opportunity to drill within these federally owned reserves. Soon after Republican Warren G. Harding was elected president in 1920, he appointed his poker-playing friend, U.S. Sen. Albert Fall, to be his secretary of Interior.  Fall, a rancher and New Mexico’s first U.S. senator, accepted the cabinet post. Within a few weeks, he convinced President Harding to allow transfer of the naval petroleum reserves from the Navy to the Department of the Interior, arguing that the department was “better able” to oversee the protection of these areas where oil was not to be produced, but kept in case of emergency.  What resulted became known as the Teapot Dome scandal, but even though the scandal gained its name from a Wyoming place, the wrongdoers were from elsewhere.  Secretary Fall, once the Teapot Dome oil field was under his control, made secret deals with two prominent oilmen, Edward Doheny and Harry Sinclair. Both men, close friends of Fall, paid him bribes to authorize them to drill in the three naval petroleum reserves—contrary to the letter and spirit of the law.  Back in Wyoming, independent oilman and later, Democratic Wyoming Gov. Leslie Miller became suspicious when he saw trucks with the Sinclair company logo hauling drilling equipment into the Teapot Dome naval petroleum reserve. He asked U.S. Sen. John B. Kendrick , also a Democrat, to look into the matter. Kendrick, sensing wrongdoing, turned the question over to a special Senate investigating committee.  Meanwhile, President Harding took a summer trip west, stopping in Wyoming, enjoying Yellowstone and continuing on to Alaska and, eventually, to San Francisco. While there, the President died suddenly. Some historians believe Harding escaped impeachment for his role in Teapot Dome by having the | Question: The administration of which American President was rocked by the 'Teapot Dome Scandal' of the 1920's?", ['president harding'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6423'), ('Context: Coldplay | New Music And Songs - MTV ArtistsColdplay | New Music And Songs |  Coldplay  About Coldplay  After surfacing in 2000 with the breakthrough single "Yellow," Coldplay quickly became one of the biggest bands of the new millennium, honing a mix of introspective Brit-pop and anthemic rock that landed the British quartet a near-permanent residence on record charts worldwide. The group\'s emergence was perfectly timed; Radiohead had just released the overly cerebral Kid A, while Oasis had ditched two founding members and embraced psychedelic experimentation on Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. Audiences were hungry for a fresh-faced rock band with big aspirations and an even bigger sound, and Coldplay were more than happy to take the reins. Parachutes went multi-platinum in several countries and earned the band its first Grammy, but Coldplay continued to grow into the 2000s, topping their debut album\'s success with higher record sales and an increased public profile.  Chris Martin (vocals/piano), Jonny Buckland (guitar), Will Champion (drums), and Guy Berryman (bass) were all born into musical households. Martin, the eldest of five, began playing the piano as a young child and later took solace in the work of Tom Waits. Buckland, on the other hand, grew up with the heavy guitar sounds of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Scotland native Berryman preferred funk to indie rock, thereby leaving him to play bass, while multi-instrumentalist Champion didn\'t plan to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay\'s lineup. The bandmates came together in 1996 while attending the University College of London, and the Safety EP was issued shortly after their first gig at a Manchester festival for unsigned bands. The release only saw 500 pressings, as did the subsequent Brothers & Sisters EP. Nevertheless, it was enough to win the band a U.K. deal with Parlophone Records in April 1999, and the five-track Blue Room EP arrived that fall. With nods from the media, Coldplay were hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simple acoustics and charming personas.  Parlophone ushered Coldplay into Parr St. Studios in Liverpool, where they recorded the bulk of their debut album. Parachutes was released in July 2000 and became a swift hit on the strength of four U.K. singles, several of which enjoyed popularity in America as well. With "Yellow" climbing the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, Parachutes was released in the U.S. in November, where its sales soon rivaled -- and eventually surpassed -- those in the U.K.  Riding on the strength of their universally popular debut, Coldplay headed back into the studio in fall 2001 to work on a sophomore album. They emerged with A Rush of Blood to the Head, releasing the album worldwide in August 2002 and embarking on a global concert tour soon after. "The Scientist" enjoyed regular radio rotation, while both "Clocks" and "In My Place" won Grammy Awards.  Coldplay began recording material for a third album in early 2004. Previously recorded material with longtime producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while Danton Supple (Morrissey, the Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&Y. "Speed of Sound" marked the band\'s first single from their long-awaited third effort in spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping charts around the world and selling more than eight million copies during its first year.  Such success put Coldplay on the same commercial level as U2, and the quartet retreated to the studio in late 2006 to work with famed producer Brian Eno (who had teamed up with U2 several times in the past).

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England. For the exterior filming, the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Buckinghamshire was used instead of a hotel.

She was the first woman in New Zealand to hold the office of prime minister immediately following an election.  Helen Clark, 2005.  Sean Gallup/Getty Images  Clark, the oldest of four children of George and Margaret Clark, grew up on a sheep and cattle farm in Te Pahu, west of Hamilton. She left home at age 12 to attend Epsom Girls Grammar School in Auckland . After graduation, she enrolled in the University of Auckland, where she received bachelor’s (1971) and master’s (1974) degrees in political science and taught from 1973 to 1981.  Clark joined the Labour Party in 1971 and during the following decade held a variety of positions within the party. In parliamentary elections in 1975, she was selected as the Labour candidate for a seat that was considered safe for the conservative National Party . Although she lost that election, she was elected to Parliament from a different constituency in 1981. As chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Select Committee (1984–87), she played a major role in the country’s adoption of an antinuclear policy, which effectively ended the ANZUS Pact and led to reduced military ties between New Zealand and the United States . In 1987 Clark became a member of the cabinet, holding at various times the portfolios of housing, conservation , labour , and health . In 1989–90 she served as deputy prime minister, and in 1990 she was appointed to the Privy Council , becoming the first woman in New Zealand to hold those offices.  After the National Party’s return to power in 1990, Clark became deputy leader of the opposition in Parliament. In 1993 she was elected head of the Labour Party —becoming the first woman in New Zealand to head a major party—and thus served as leader of the opposition. In 1999, when the Labour Party was able to form a governing coalition, Clark was elected prime minister. Holding the portfolio of arts and culture herself, she appointed an extraordinarily diverse cabinet, including 11 women and 4 Maori . As prime minister, Clark addressed many controversial issues, including Maori rights, same-sex civil unions, and prostitution, which was legalized in 2003. Her government also opposed the U.S. and British invasion of Iraq (see Iraq War ). She was reelected prime minister in both 2002 and 2005, the first New Zealand prime minister to secure three consecutive terms in office. Amid an economic downturn, Clark’s Labour Party was defeated by John Key and the National Party in the 2008 election. Clark subsequently stepped down as Labour leader. In 2009 Clark was named the administrator of the United Nations Development Programme .

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission.

They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters.  Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.  Charters have been used in Europe since medieval times to create cities (that is, localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter is granted is considered to be when a city is 'founded', regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled (which is often impossible to determine).  At one time, a royal charter was the sole means by which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally used nowadays instead.  Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the British East India Company (1600), the Hudson's Bay Company, Standard Chartered, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), the British South Africa Company, and some of the former British colonies on the North American mainland, City livery companies, the Bank of England and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

In the period before 1958, 32 higher education institutes had been created by royal charter. These were typically engineering or technical institutions rather than universities.   However, several non-technical higher education institutions have been founded, or refounded, under royal decree:  * Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique, National Fund for Scientific Research, 1928   * Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten, 1938   * International Institute for Research and Education, 1982  Since the Belgian state reform of 1988–1989, competency over education was transferred to the federated entities of Belgium. Royal decrees can therefore no longer grant higher education institution status or university status.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

The group\'s emergence was perfectly timed; Radiohead had just released the overly cerebral Kid A, while Oasis had ditched two founding members and embraced psychedelic experimentation on Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. Audiences were hungry for a fresh-faced rock band with big aspirations and an even bigger sound, and Coldplay were more than happy to take the reins. Parachutes went multi-platinum in several countries and earned the band its first Grammy, but Coldplay continued to grow into the 2000s, topping their debut album\'s success with higher record sales and an increased public profile.  Chris Martin (vocals/piano), Jonny Buckland (guitar), Will Champion (drums), and Guy Berryman (bass) were all born into musical households. Martin, the eldest of five, began playing the piano as a young child and later took solace in the work of Tom Waits. Buckland, on the other hand, grew up with the heavy guitar sounds of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. Scotland native Berryman preferred funk to indie rock, thereby leaving him to play bass, while multi-instrumentalist Champion didn\'t plan to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay\'s lineup. The bandmates came together in 1996 while attending the University College of London, and the Safety EP was issued shortly after their first gig at a Manchester festival for unsigned bands. The release only saw 500 pressings, as did the subsequent Brothers & Sisters EP. Nevertheless, it was enough to win the band a U.K. deal with Parlophone Records in April 1999, and the five-track Blue Room EP arrived that fall. With nods from the media, Coldplay were hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simple acoustics and charming personas.  Parlophone ushered Coldplay into Parr St. Studios in Liverpool, where they recorded the bulk of their debut album. Parachutes was released in July 2000 and became a swift hit on the strength of four U.K. singles, several of which enjoyed popularity in America as well. With "Yellow" climbing the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, Parachutes was released in the U.S. in November, where its sales soon rivaled -- and eventually surpassed -- those in the U.K.  Riding on the strength of their universally popular debut, Coldplay headed back into the studio in fall 2001 to work on a sophomore album. They emerged with A Rush of Blood to the Head, releasing the album worldwide in August 2002 and embarking on a global concert tour soon after. "The Scientist" enjoyed regular radio rotation, while both "Clocks" and "In My Place" won Grammy Awards.  Coldplay began recording material for a third album in early 2004. Previously recorded material with longtime producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while Danton Supple (Morrissey, the Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&Y. "Speed of Sound" marked the band\'s first single from their long-awaited third effort in spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping charts around the world and selling more than eight million copies during its first year.  Such success put Coldplay on the same commercial level as U2, and the quartet retreated to the studio in late 2006 to work with famed producer Brian Eno (who had teamed up with U2 several times in the past). Recording sessions with Eno were completed within one year, followed by several months of mixing and growing anticipation from the band\'s audience. Viva la Vida -- also known by its extended name, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends -- ultimately arrived in June 2008.

She left home at age 12 to attend Epsom Girls Grammar School in Auckland . After graduation, she enrolled in the University of Auckland, where she received bachelor’s (1971) and master’s (1974) degrees in political science and taught from 1973 to 1981.  Clark joined the Labour Party in 1971 and during the following decade held a variety of positions within the party. In parliamentary elections in 1975, she was selected as the Labour candidate for a seat that was considered safe for the conservative National Party . Although she lost that election, she was elected to Parliament from a different constituency in 1981. As chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Select Committee (1984–87), she played a major role in the country’s adoption of an antinuclear policy, which effectively ended the ANZUS Pact and led to reduced military ties between New Zealand and the United States . In 1987 Clark became a member of the cabinet, holding at various times the portfolios of housing, conservation , labour , and health . In 1989–90 she served as deputy prime minister, and in 1990 she was appointed to the Privy Council , becoming the first woman in New Zealand to hold those offices.  After the National Party’s return to power in 1990, Clark became deputy leader of the opposition in Parliament. In 1993 she was elected head of the Labour Party —becoming the first woman in New Zealand to head a major party—and thus served as leader of the opposition. In 1999, when the Labour Party was able to form a governing coalition, Clark was elected prime minister. Holding the portfolio of arts and culture herself, she appointed an extraordinarily diverse cabinet, including 11 women and 4 Maori . As prime minister, Clark addressed many controversial issues, including Maori rights, same-sex civil unions, and prostitution, which was legalized in 2003. Her government also opposed the U.S. and British invasion of Iraq (see Iraq War ). She was reelected prime minister in both 2002 and 2005, the first New Zealand prime minister to secure three consecutive terms in office. Amid an economic downturn, Clark’s Labour Party was defeated by John Key and the National Party in the 2008 election. Clark subsequently stepped down as Labour leader. In 2009 Clark was named the administrator of the United Nations Development Programme .

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission. Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics, and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing Liberal Party, or from a new group driven by | Question: Who was the female member of the SDP\'s \'Gang Of Four\'?', ['shirley williams'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2607'), ("Context: Royal charterA royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters.  Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011.  Charters have been used in Europe since medieval times to create cities (that is, localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter is granted is considered to be when a city is 'founded', regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled (which is often impossible to determine).  At one time, a royal charter was the sole means by which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally used nowadays instead.  Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the British East India Company (1600), the Hudson's Bay Company, Standard Chartered, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), the British South Africa Company, and some of the former British colonies on the North American mainland, City livery companies, the Bank of England and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).   Australia  * Scout Association of Australia (23 August 1967)  Universities and colleges  * The University of Sydney obtained a Royal Charter in 1858  (3 February 1858)  * The University of Tasmania obtained a Royal Charter (Letters Patent) in 1915  (30 August 1915)  * The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology  Companies and societies  * Van Diemen's Land Company received a Royal Charter in 1825  Professional organisations  * Royal Australasian College of Surgeons  * Australian Institute of Building  * Engineers Australia  * Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia  * Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers  * Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia Incorporated  * Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists  * Royal Australian Artillery Association  * Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists  * Royal Australian Chemical Institute  * Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators  * Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors  Other organisations   * Royal Automobile Club of Queensland  *Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland  * Royal Queensland Art Society  * Royal Queensland Golf Club  * Royal Queensland Regiment  * Royal Queensland Show   * Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron  Belgium  The royal decree is the equivalent in Belgium of a Royal Charter. In the period before 1958, 32 higher education institutes had been created by royal charter. These were typically engineering or technical institutions rather than universities.   However, several non-technical higher education institutions have been founded, or refounded, under royal decree:  * Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique, National Fund for Scientific Research, 1928   * Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten, 1938   * International Institute for Research and Education, 1982  Since the Belgian state reform of 1988–1989, competency over education was transferred to the federated entities of Belgium. Royal decrees can therefore no longer grant higher education institution status or university status.   Canada  A Royal Charter is granted by Order in Council, either creating an incorporated body, or giving an existent one special status.  This is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative, and, in Canada, there are hundreds of organisations under Royal Charters.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.
