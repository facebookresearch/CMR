The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin.

Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself.

On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D.

The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million.

Uploaded on Mar 31, 2007  Some clips of a young Catherine Zeta Jones as Mariette, in the tv series, "The Darling Buds of May".  "The Darling Buds of May" was a British television series first broadcast in 1991. It is set in an idyllic rural 1950s Kent, among a large, boisterous family. The show was very popular, and launched the acting career of Catherine Zeta Jones.

Character Bio  Mariette Larkin, the eldest Larkin child. Her name was created by  combining \'Marie\' and \'Antoinette\'. In the first episode, she is shown  to be the family beauty and slightly wild. However, she quickly marries  Charley and settles down with him for the rest of the series. She  appears to have inherited Pop\'s business sense, and at the end of the  series she and Charley buy and manage a local brewery. Her wedding  ceremony reveals her middle name as Jane.

Along the way, the 41-year-old has picked up an Oscar, a Tony, a CBE, countless plaudits and a smattering of bad reviews.  She married Hollywood actor Michael Douglas in a lavish New York ceremony in 2000, however the couple have now decided to take some time apart to "evaluate and work on their marriage".  Few could have predicted that a girl born to a sweet factory owner and a seamstress would go on to become one of the most famous actresses in the world.  At the age of 10, the Welsh star won a national talent contest singing a Shirley Bassey song before landing roles in various West End productions.  Image caption Zeta Jones started acting at a very young age  She got her big break at the age of 17, following a promotion from second understudy to the lead role in the hit musical 42nd Street.  But it was Zeta Jones\'s first major TV role, in the 1991 comedy drama The Darling Buds of May, that made her a household name.  Set in rural Kent in the 1950s, viewers fell in love with the Larkins, played by Sir David Jason and Pam Ferris.  Zeta Jones played their fresh-faced sweetheart daughter Mariette.  Squeaky-clean perception  Off camera, her personal life began to hit the headlines more than her acting ability.  Her relationship with Blue Peter presenter John Leslie was well documented. She also became involved with Simply Red star Mick Hucknall and Soldier Soldier actor Angus MacFadyen.  After leaving The Darling Buds of May, Zeta Jones turned her attention to film, but admitted finding it hard to shake off the public\'s squeaky-clean perception of her.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...

She is an only child . Evie attends a school for gifted children ( run by her mother ) and achieves good grades there . Her mother had always told Evie that her father was a secret agent , but on her thirteenth birthday Evie began to develop superhuman abilities and it was revealed that her father is an extraterrestrial from the planet Antareus . Evie 's main power is the ability to freeze time on Earth by touching the tips of her index fingers together , allowing her to maneuver herself or objects to alter the course of events on Earth . When she claps her hands together , time resumes as normal . She can also `` unfreeze '' individuals by touching them while time is frozen . She later gains the power to gleep , which allows her to manifest objects by using the power of her mind . Her father describes her as `` the perfect child : loving ; caring ; with the same needs of most teenagers '' . The series follows Evie through her teenage years , from her thirteenth birthday in the first episode to her eighteenth birthday in the final episode .

Since then , Troy occasionally visits Earth , and stays in touch with his daughter via a special communication device known as the `` cube '' ( see below ) . Troy 's powers seem to be almost limitless : though he lives on Antareus , he can control many things on Earth ( from computers to the weather ) ; he can give and take away Evie 's powers at will ; and also seems to be aware of certain events on Earth . While Troy appears in the show 's opening credits , he rarely makes a physical appearance in the series -- and when he does his face is obscured ( for example , via a surgical mask or shadows ) . In the series finale , when Troy arrives on Earth , he is seen in a silhouette with stars from the galaxy . Troy was credited as `` himself '' in the opening credits from Season Two onwards .

The gecko first appeared in 1999 , during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors . The original commercial features the Gecko , voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer , who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters `` This is my final plea : I am a gecko , not to be confused with GEICO , which could save you hundreds on car insurance . So , STOP CALLING ME ! '' , before licking his eye . Later `` wrong number '' ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko . In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood ( which portray him as a representative of the company ) , the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent , because it would be unexpected , according to Martin Agency 's Steve Bassett .

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

They are the most recent expression of a cutting style that has been around for centuries. Photo by Eric Welch, © GIA, courtesy of Signed Pieces, New York  Introduction  Most consumers in today’s marketplace choose round brilliant-cut diamonds fashioned to meet modern concepts of beauty. These sparkling gems represent the collective talents of generations of skilled cutters over more than six centuries.  As diamond cuts evolved into today’s 57- or 58-facet round brilliants, styles progressed through many stages. By 1750, when the brilliant cut had developed into a style with a circular face-up outline, it had passed through many variations in facet size and proportions. These included table size, crown height, length of the lower half facets, total depth, and culet size.  This illustration shows the names and arrangement of the facets of a standard round  brilliant-cut. Illustration by Peter Johnston, © GIA  This progression has resulted in diamonds from different periods having quite distinct appearances. Over time, table facets have become larger, culets smaller, and star facets and lower half facets longer. If you rock or tilt one of the older-style gems, you’ll see a different face-up pattern of light and dark than you would with a contemporary brilliant-cut.  Transition to Modern Brilliants  Play  This video shows three styles of brilliants with round face-up outlines. From left to right, they are an old European cut, in place by 1750; a “transitional” brilliant from around 1880; and a modern round brilliant, in place since the 1950s. The transitional cut is labeled “circular brilliant” in the video; this is the same term now used by GIA on grading reports.The three animations show how cutting styles developed over time, causing the different face-up patterns associated with each proportion set. Animations by Al Gilbertson, © GIA  Many beautiful older diamonds present a conundrum for diamond-grading laboratories—including GIA's—because their proportions diverge from contemporary conventions. This makes it difficult to judge them against today’s aesthetic. In spite of this, there is a market for their antique beauty. In fact, some consumers cherish their different interplay with light.  Compared to a modern round brilliant cut, this older-style 1.07-ct. brilliant has a much smaller table (38.5 percent), a higher crown, shorter lower halves, and a much larger culet. Digitally modified image by Al Gilbertson, © GIA, courtesy of Michael Goldstein  Compared to a modern brilliant, older gems typically show larger face-up patterns of light and dark—what might be described as a “checkerboard” or “blocky” pattern. A modern brilliant can display a tighter mosaic of light and dark that might be described as “splintery” by those who prefer older cutting styles.  Many older round brilliants were cut between the 1870s and the 1940s. Because some served as transitions between older and more-modern styles, some trade professionals call them “transitional cuts.”  Recent high prices for precious metals have caused many pieces containing older-style diamonds to be broken up, releasing more of these beautiful gems into the market and increasing appreciation for their historic nature.  This article explains GIA’s approach to describing these beautiful older-style brilliant-cut diamonds.  The GIA Cut-Grading System for Unmodified Brilliant-Cut Diamonds  In 2005, GIA introduced a cut-grading system for unmodified round brilliant cut diamonds. The name “unmodified round brilliant” was applied to a symmetrical round cut with a regular array of 58 facets, cut to modern standards. The system was the culmination of years of research that included the results of preference testing among a wide variety of groups, including trade professionals and consumers.  GIA designed the system to assess the design quality and craftsmanship of diamonds cut in the standard round brilliant style when compared to modern preferences. | Question: A modern round brilliant cut has 58 what?", ['facets'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3808'), ('Context: Canola Oil and Rape Seed : snopes.comCanola Oil and Rape Seed : snopes.com  Claim: \xa0 Ordinary use of Canola oil is dangerous to consumers.  FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ("Context: Brazil 's population , as recorded by the 2010 Census , was of 190,755,799 inhabitants ( 22.40 inhabitants per square kilometer ) , with 84.36 % of the population defined as urban .

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.  The phrase is now used internationally and it’s not surprising it has become the third most known slogan of all time.  \xa0  \xa0  [1] The phrase is a registered trademark of Ronseal’s owner, the Sherwin-Williams Company , across the European Community for products including paints, varnishes and wood preservatives (E3085826)  [3] Source Creative Review February 2012  \xa0  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tinThe Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin - BBC News  BBC News  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin  8 January 2013  Read more about sharing.  Close share panel  Prime Minister David Cameron used a famous advertising slogan to sum up the state of the coalition government at its halfway point, saying "it is a Ronseal deal - it does what it says on the tin".

In 2004, he said: "People are crying out for a kind of Ronseal politics - they want it to do what it says on the tin."  People use the phrase every day.

New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter.

And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.

It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures.

D. U.  The first performance of Elgar’s ‘Enigma’ Variations took place at St James’s Hall London on 19 June 1899, conducted by Hans Richter. It was Elgar’s most ambitious orchestral work to date and a further performance in Düsseldorf in 1901 went on to establish him as a composer of international importance: Richard Strauss declared that ‘here for the first time is an English composer who has something to say’.  Like most overnight successes, it was the result of years of hard work. Elgar was 42 years old when he completed the Variations and, despite bitter disappointments and frustrations, had steadily built up a reputation, first provincially, then at a national level. In particular, a series of cantatas of increasing size had revealed Elgar’s brilliant orchestration and growing mastery of large forms. Now that mastery was demonstrated on a symphonic scale through the time-honoured form of Theme and Variations, inviting comparisons with the greatest classical masters. But it was Elgar’s uniquely personal approach to the form that gave the ‘Enigma’ Variations its initial novelty and lasting appeal.  Elgar himself recalled how the work came to be conceived on the evening of 21 October 1898:  After a long day’s fiddle teaching in Malvern, I came home very tired. Dinner being over, my dear wife said to me, ‘Edward, you look like a good cigar,’ and having lighted it, I sat down at the piano. In a little while, soothed and feeling rested, I began to play, and suddenly my wife interrupted by saying, ‘Edward, that’s a good tune.’ I awoke from the dream: ‘Eh! tune, what tune!’ and she said, ‘Play it again, I like that tune.’ I played and strummed, and played, and then she exclaimed, ‘That’s the tune.’ And that tune is the theme of the Variations.  Many years later Elgar’s daughter Carice recounted the same incident in a BBC broadcast:  My father was at the piano, smoking his pipe, and when I went to bed I heard him playing what I thought were pretty tunes. My mother told me he was inventing music about his friends, and he turned to her and said, ‘Who’s that like?’ My mother replied, ‘I can’t quite say, but it’s exactly the way WMB goes out of the room.’  The grand scheme was established at the outset: 13 variations, 13 musical sketches of ‘my friends pictured within’, as the dedication eventually ran, and a final 14th variation representing the composer himself.  What of the ‘Enigma’ of the title? Before the first performance, Elgar said:  The ‘Enigma’ I will not explain – its ‘dark saying’ must be left unguessed, and I warn you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the Theme is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole set another and larger theme ‘goes’, but is not played . . . So the principal Theme never appears, even as in some late dramas – eg Maeterlinck’s L’Intruse and Les sept Princesses – the chief character is never on stage.  More ink has probably been spilt over these sentences than on any other Elgarian topic, each of the dozens of proposed solutions adding yet another layer of mystery to an already ambiguous pronouncement. What is clear is that the name ‘Enigma’ applies only to the theme itself and not to the whole work. Writing in 1911 Elgar revealed that this work, commenced in a spirit of humour & continued in deep seriousness, contains sketches of the composer’s friends. It may be understood that these personages comment or reflect on the original theme & each one attempts a solution of the Enigma, for so the theme is called. The sketches are not ‘portraits’, but each variation contains a distinct idea founded on some particular personality or perhaps on some incident known | Question: Which musical work of 1898 features a section called 'Nimrod'?", ['Enigma Variations', 'Enigma’ Variations', 'enigma variations'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4729'), ("Context: Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D.B.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge). He also takes pupils - notably Fiona Allways (played by Rosalyn Landor) and Liz Probert. The creator and writer of the series, Sir John Mortimer, received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for crime and mystery for Rumpole.

Down those mean streets and meaner chambers a man must waddle...  Lord knows, he\'s not a private eye, but God, I wish he were. Like Philip Marlowe , Rumpole is ""a relatively poor man... a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of character, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\'s money dishonestly and no man\'s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks -- that is, with a rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness."  So, may I submit for your consideration, Your Honour....  That great defender of most muddled and sinful humanity...  With his jowls a-quiver...  His fondness for Wordsworth, Chateau Thames Embankment and hopeless cases...  His cheroot-puffing and claret-quaffing...  His food-bespeckled robe and raggedy wig...  And his beloved and tattered copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse clutched to his bosom...  For his oratorical outbursts...  His always entertaining jabs at the soft underbelly of hypocrisy, pomposity and upper class twits...  And for standing up for truth, justice, honour and the Golden Thread of Justice...

Mortimer wrote each and every episode of the television series, and their subsequent novelizations. The show ran, off and on, for seventeen years, an incredible run, and inspired not just the short stories, but novels and two radio series.

It wasn\'t a very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called The Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, and it was all there was.  "And in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the Locomotive of the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, which was a long name for a little engine so his friends just called him Ivor."  Ivor The Engine was a children\'s animation created by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin\'s Smallfilms television company. It was made in black and white for Associated Rediffusion and first broadcast in 1959, but was remade in colour for the BBC in 1975.  It told the story of a sometimes disobedient small green locomotive who worked for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Rail Traction Company Limited, although he dreamed of singing with the Grumbley and District Choral Society. In time he became first bass of the choir and transported the members from place to place.  His driver was Edwin Jones, known as Jones the Steam, who enjoyed fishing and daydreaming. Ivor\'s other friends included stationmaster Dai Station, portly choirmaster Evans the Song, fellow chorister Idris the Dragon, and fairground owner Morgan the Roundabout. Mr Morgan gave Ivor some pipes from his steam calliope to allow him to sing in the choir.  Behind the scenes  Ivor The Engine was inspired by Welshman Denzyl Ellis, a former railwayman whom Postgate met shortly after World War Two. Ellis, a former fireman with the Royal Scot train, described how locomotives came to life in the mornings after the engine fires had been lit.  The programme was Smallfilms\' first production. Although set in Wales, Ivor The Engine was actually made in Firmin\'s home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, using stop-motion animation techniques. Cardboard cutouts painted with watercolours were used for the characters and backgrounds.  The programmes were written and narrated by Oliver Postgate and drawn and painted by Peter Firmin. Voices were performed by Oliver Postgate, Anthony Jackson and Olwen Griffiths - the only Welsh person involved in the production.  The distinctive puffing sound made as Ivor moved was voiced by Postgate, and the show\'s music was composed by Vernon Elliott. Ivor\'s \'voice\' was mostly sounded by a bassoon.  Postgate described himself as having been "intoxicated by the work of Dylan Thomas , and used to carry Under Milk Wood around in my pocket". Wales was a logical setting for the tale, and became romanticised in Postgate\'s fictionalised world.  "Wales is where you have little railways going along the tops of hills, which is much less boring that hurtling up the slumbering Midlands plain in the middle of the night," he told science fiction enthusiast Clive Banks , "so we decided it would be nice to set it in Wales."  "Ivor The Engine is entirely bogus as far as Wales is concerned - it\'s built entirely on a picture of Wales given by Dylan Thomas! Then, literally in the bath, I came to realise what the story was: the engine wanted to sing in the choir, which is obviously what a Welsh engine would want, so from then on it fell into place.  Postgate and Firmin created a map of the top left corner of north Wales where Ivor lived. It included viaducts, bridges, tunnels, towns, a mine and gasworks, and was strictly adhered to by the show\'s creators.  The episodes  The original series comprised six episodes, and told the story of Ivor getting his pipes and joining the choir. They were followed by two further series of 13 episodes, all of which were in black and white. Each lasted 10 minutes.  The animations were shown regularly by Associated Rediffusion until the company folded in 1968.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

Before he changed the music industry with songs like "Ring of Fire" and "Folsom Prison Blues," Johnny Cash spent his hardscrabble childhood in the small community of Dyess, Arkansas.  The Johnny Cash Boyhood Home, the newest of Arkansas State University\'s Heritage Sites, opens Saturday for public tours after a restoration project that includes other historic buildings.  When visitors walk into the home, they are stepping back into the 1930s.  Cash family artifacts original to the home include the piano that belonged to Johnny\'s mother, his father\'s shaving mug and even the original flooring in his childhood bedroom and the living room. The living room linoleum still has burn marks caused by the wood-burning stove.  Other furnishings and objects are of the time period and mostly contributed by donors, said Ruth Hawkins, director of Arkansas Heritage Sites at Arkansas State University. They are based on the photos and memories of Tommy Cash and Joanne Cash Yates, two of Johnny Cash\'s siblings.  Period details include a pedestal sewing machine, a battery-operated radio like one Johnny Cash would play at night and the living-room sofa. The period icebox and corner cabinet were painted the apple-green color the siblings remember.  The Dyess Colony was a federal agricultural resettlement community created in 1934, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s New Deal program in response to the Great Depression.  The colony provided homes and jobs for about 500 poor farm families, including the Cash family.  Johnny, called JR at the time, was 3 years old when his family moved into a Dyess home in 1935.  Johnny spent his childhood in Dyess, attending school and church in the town. He also suffered an enormous loss when his brother Jack was killed in a sawmill accident in 1944.  Cash left "JR" behind and became Johnny when he left Arkansas for the Air Force in 1950.  Arkansas was an important influence on Cash, who told audiences how "Five Feet High and Rising" and many of his other songs were influenced by his time living in Dyess.  "The little church in Dyess, Arkansas, has been such an inspiration to me, and (so have) the people from Dyess," Cash said at the 40th reunion of Dyess High School in 1990, in a video exhibited at the Dyess Colony Museum.  Cash died in 2003, leaving four daughters from his first marriage to Vivian Liberto. Cash and his second wife, singer June Carter Cash, had a son together. June Carter Cash died earlier in 2003.  The annual Johnny Cash Music Festival , which starts on Friday in nearby Jonesboro, has raised almost $2 million to fund the restoration project. Headliners for this year\'s sold-out festival include Reba McEntire, Bobby Bare and Loretta Lynn, who are donating their performances, as have artists in previous years.  With the restoration of Cash\'s childhood home and nearby Dyess Colony Administration Building complete, work has already begun on the restoration of the historic Dyess Theatre adjacent to the administration building, to be used as a visitor center.  In his 1997 autobiography, "Cash," he credited his state with inspiring his music. "Back in Arkansas, a way of life produced a certain kind of music."

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology.

Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) .

Location of Coney Island on a map.  Coney Island is a city found in New York , The United States Of America . It is located 40.58 latitude and -73.99 longitude and it is situated at elevation 2 meters above sea level.  Coney Island has a population of 60,000 making it the 23rd biggest city in New York. It operates on the EDT time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as New York City.  Quick facts  Coney Island, Brooklyn | New York City Tourist AttractionsConey Island, Brooklyn  | New York City Tourist Attractions  Coney Island  Coney Island  Probably one of the most popular tourist areas in the entire city of New York is Coney Island. It is a beloved location and every much part of the city’s psyche as other famous symbols, such as the Statue of Liberty.  Coney Island is a peninsula in the southernmost part of Brooklyn, New York. It comprises a neighborhood with approximately 60,000 inhabitants and is well-known for its long stretch of sandy beaches on the Atlantic coastline, as well as its cultural events and amusement parks. The charm and history of this area makes it that no visit to New York would be complete without a stopover at Coney Island.  History  Coney Island was known as Narrioch (“Land without Shadows”) by the Native Americans because the area is flooded by sunlight all day long. When the island – which is now a peninsula – was settled by the Dutch, they called it Konijn Eiland (meaning ‘Rabbit Island’). The name was eventually anglicized to Coney Island.  After the American Civil War, Coney Island became a resort and was accessible by new streetcars and railroads. The area grew rapidly into a popular destination for people seeking pleasure in hotels, beaches, amusement parks and horseracing. It also developed a reputation for itself in some of the shadier areas, such as prostitution and gambling. As transportation methods improved, Coney Island became more popular for New Yorkers seeking a day excursion.  The heydays of Coney Island reached their peak in the early 1900s and then slowly started to decline after the Second World War. New Yorkers started seeking out other, cleaner areas, with a better reputation. Years of neglect followed in this once grand area, however local inhabitants still have a soft spot for Coney Island and its splendid past.  In recent years, Coney Island has enjoyed a revival, especially with the opening of the KeySpan baseball park, which is home to the wildly successful and popular Brooklyn Cyclones baseball team.  In addition, organizations such as Coney Island USA, a not-for-profit corporation founded in 1983, have taken it upon themselves to revitalize the area and attract the tourists and visitors back. Coney Island USA develops a number of different programs such as the much-loved Mermaid Parade and the Circus Side Show. It also runs the Coney Island Museum.  Things to Do and See in Coney Island  The Coney Island Museum  For less than a dollar, visitors can get to see artifacts that bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear Coney Island in this quaint museum. Located on the second floor of an historic building on Surf Avenue with a delightful view of classic amusement park rides, the Coney Island museum interprets and preserves the history of the area through a small but fascinating collection of items. Visitors get to see quirky pieces of the collection, such as a hand-carved figure of the Steeplechase Man and Boardwalk rolling chair.  The museum is open every Saturday and Sunday between 12 and 5 pm, right through the year, with opening hours sometimes extended during the summer months. The museum also serves as a tourist information center where visitors can use the bathrooms and receive knowledgeable answers to the questions about the area.

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. | Question: Who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', ['fox talbot', 'henry fox talbot'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6913'), ("Context: Hugh Jackman as P.T.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

This butterfly is unmistakable, with the velvety black wings intersected by striking red bands.  This butterfly is primarily a migrant to our shores, although sightings of individuals and immature stages in the first few months of the year, especially in the south of England, mean that this butterfly is now considered resident. This resident population is considered to only be a small fraction of the population seen in the British Isles, which gets topped up every year with migrants arriving in May and June that originate in central Europe. Unfortunately, most individuals are unable to survive our winter, especially in the cooler regions of the British Isles.  The number of adults seen in any one year is therefore dependent on the number of migrants reaching the British Isles and numbers fluctuate as a result. In some years this butterfly can be widespread and common, in others rather local and scarce. This is a widespread species and can be found anywhere in the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland .

Distribution  \xa0  Click here to see the distribution of this species or here to see the distribution of this species together with specific site information overlaid.  Life Cycle  Adults may be seen throughout the year but there is build up in May and June as migrants arrive from the continent. These breed and give rise to the next generation of adults with a peak of emergence between mid-August and early October. There is a single brood each year.  The chart(s) above have been correlated with the phenology plot below, taken from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme . The blue line gives average counts over the full data set from 1976 to date, and the red line gives the average for the last year.  Imago  The adults use a wide variety of nectar sources, including Buddleia, Ivy blossom and Bramble. They are also partial to rotting fruit, such as plums that have fallen from the tree. When resting on the ground or on a tree trunk, the undersides of the adults provide superb camouflage, making them almost invisible as they blend into the background.  Egg-laying females are very easy to spot. The powerful flight is replaced by a slow and deliberate flight as she flits from leaf to leaf of the foodplant, depositing an egg if the leaf is deemed suitable. Egg-laying is typically interspersed with periods of nectaring and resting.  Photo Album (15 photos) ...  Larva  The larva lives within a tent formed by folding the edges of a leaf together, emerging only to feed. As the larva grows it will form a new tent. The larva of this species is one of the easiest to find in a nettle patch, since its location is given away by a series of tents that are highly-visible to the trained eye. The larva is usually found in the largest of these tents.  The larva has several colour forms, ranging from black, to greenish-brown to a very pale yellowish-green. This stage lasts between 3 and 4 weeks, depending on temperature.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.  A Last Hurrah  In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.  \xa0  Final Stop  After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.  \xa0  The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.  \xa0  At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

FALSE  Example: \xa0 [Collected via e-mail, 2001]  Before you buy your next bottle of cooking oil . . .  I think it\'s important that as many people as possible KNOW about the origins of this product. Then, if you choose to buy it, at least you\'re doing so with your eyes open.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISE  Dear Editors  Recently I bought a cooking oil that\'s new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in "bad" fats. However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from? Olive oil comes from olives, peanut oil from peanuts, sunflower oil from sunflowers; but what is a canola? There was nothing on the label to enlighten me, which I thought odd. So, I did some investigating on the Internet.  There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new "wonder" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.  It takes a little longer to find sites that tell the less palatable details.  Here are just a few facts everyone should know before buying anything containing canola.  Canola is not the name of a natural plant but a made-up word, from the words "Canada" and "oil".  Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.  According to AgriAlternatives, The Online Innovation, and Technology Magazine for Farmers, "By nature, these rapeseed oils, which have long been used to produce oils for industrial purposes, are... toxic to humans and other animals". (This, by the way, is one of the websites singing the praises of the new canola industry.)  Rapeseed oil is poisonous to living things and is an excellent insect repellent.  I have been using it (in very diluted form, as per instructions) to kill the aphids on my roses for the last two years.  It works very well; it suffocates them.  Ask for it at your nursery.  Rape is an oil that is used as a lubricant, fuel, soap and synthetic rubber base and as a illuminate for color pages in magazines.  It is an industrial oil.  It is not a food. Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.  Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out. Remember the "Mad Cow disease" scare, when millions of cattle in the UK were slaughtered in case of infecting humans? Cattle were being fed on a mixture containing material from dead sheep, and sheep suffer from a disease called "scrapie".  It was thought this was how "Mad Cow" began and started to infiltrate the human chain.  What is  interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, \'scrapie\' disappeared.  We also haven\'t seen any further reports of "Mad Cow" since rape oil was removed from the feed. Perhaps not scientifically proven, but interesting all the same.  US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.  The canola supporting websites say that canola is safe to use.  They admit it was developed from the rapeseed, but insist that through genetic engineering it is no longer rapeseed, but "canola" instead.  Except canola means "Canadian oil"; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified. The new name provides perfect cover for commercial interests wanting to make millions.

Synopsis  Photo: Wikipedia  Wichita (/ˈwɪtʃᵻtɔː/ WITCH-ə-taw) is the largest city in the state of Kansas and the 48th-largest city in the United States. Located in south-central Kansas on the Arkansas River, Wichita is the county seat of Sedgwick County and the principal city of the Wichita metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population was 382,368; as of 2014, it was estimated to have increased to 389,965. In 2015, the estimated population of the Wichita metropolitan area was 644,610, and that of the larger Wichita-Winfield combined statistical area was 680,398.  The city began as a trading post on the Chisholm Trail in the 1860s, then was incorporated in 1870. It subsequently became a key destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to access railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In the 1920s and 1930s, businessmen and aeronautical engineers established a number of successful aircraft manufacturing companies in Wichita including Beechcraft, Cessna, and Stearman Aircraft. The city transformed into a hub of U.S. aircraft production and became known as "The Air Capital of the World". Beechcraft, Cessna, (both now part of Textron Aviation) and other firms including Learjet, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems continue to operate design and manufacturing facilities in Wichita today, and the city remains a major center of the U.S. aircraft industry.  As an industrial hub and the largest city in the state, Wichita is an area center of culture, media, and trade. It hosts several large museums, theatres, parks, and entertainment venues, notably Intrust Bank Arena. Several universities are located in the city including Wichita State University, the third largest in the state. The city\'s daily newspaper, The Wichita Eagle, has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Kansas, and the Wichita broadcast television market includes the western two-thirds of the state. Wichita is also home to two large shopping malls, Towne East Square and Towne West Square, as well as the Century II Performing Arts & Convention Center and Kansas\'s largest airport, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport.

NOTE: The numbers in brackets are links to footnotes for this text.  THE Chisholm trail is one of the most important but least known trails in American history. Its story has never been completely told, which accounts, to a large degree, for the many misconceptions which are held concerning it.  At the annual meeting of the Old-Time Trail Drivers\' Association in San Antonio there ensues a perennial dispute both as to the origin of the Chisholm trail and its location. At present they seem to be no nearer the solution than at the beginning. In their monumental work entitled, The Trail Drivers of Texas (1925 edition), written by the trail drivers themselves, we find on page 289 one explanation, while on page 950 we find an emphatic denial of this, with quite another explanation set forth in no uncertain terms.  Modern scholarship has as yet neglected to deal with the subject in a thorough manner. Thus most that is known concerning the Chisholm trail is from the stories of the trail drivers, whose memories are no doubt dimmed by time, and from various accounts dealing with the cattle industry which treat it only in an indirect manner.  The object of this monograph is to make a critical analysis of available source material concerning the origin and location of the Chisholm trail. It will emphasize material brought out by maps of the period located in the Library of Congress, and bring to light the hitherto unpublished accounts of James R. Mead, an associate of Jesse Chisholm in the early-day trading business.

The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due of financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers and/or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can\'t charge tuition fees (they can charge "attendance dues" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation\'s then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets. | Question: What percentage of New Zealand students attended private schools in April 2014?', ['3.7%', '3.7'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-7042'), ("Context: Characterized by Rhimes as a dork with issues expressing her feelings , Lexie 's focal storyline in the series involved her romantic relationship with plastics attending Mark Sloan ( Eric Dane ) .

It is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory . The island is located in the Indian Ocean , about 1,600\xa0km (1,000\xa0mi) south of the southern coast of India . [3] The closest other countries to Diego Garcia are Sri Lanka and Maldives .  In the 1960s, the Chagos archipelago was secretly leased to the United Kingdom and detached from Mauritius with the intention of expelling its entire population and establishing a military base. In 1971 the United Kingdom and United States entered an agreement under which the latter would set up a military base in Diego Garcia.  Since then, the United Kingdom enforced the highly controversial depopulation of Diego Garcia , forcing the deportation of all 2,000 inhabitants of the island, who were descendants of African slaves and Hindu labourers brought to the islands by the French in the 18th century, to the surrounding islands, including Mauritius, located 1,200 miles away. In their place, a joint British-American military base was established.  This island has one of the five monitoring stations assisting the operation of the Global Positioning System , the others being on Ascension Island , Hawaii , Kwajalein Atoll and in Colorado Springs .  It is covered in luxuriant tropical vegetation. It is 60\xa0kilometres (37\xa0mi) long, with a maximum elevation of 6.7\xa0metres (22\xa0ft), and nearly encloses a lagoon about 19\xa0kilometres (12\xa0mi) long and up to 8\xa0kilometres (5.0\xa0mi) wide. Depths in the lagoon extend to 30\xa0metres (98\xa0ft), and numerous coral heads present hazards to navigation. Shallow reefs surround the island on the ocean side. The channel and anchorage area are dredged , while the old turning basin can also be used.  Contents  Geography  Location map of Diego Garcia.  The atoll forms a nearly complete rim of land around a lagoon, enclosing 90 percent of its perimeter , with an opening only in the north. The main island is the largest of about sixty islands which form the Chagos Archipelago. Besides the main island, there are three small islets at the mouth of the lagoon:  West Island (3.4 ha /8.4 acres)  Middle Island (6 ha /14.8 acres)  East Island (11.75 ha /29 acres)  A fourth island shown on some maps, Anniversary Island one kilometre southwest of Middle Island, appears as just a sand bar on satellite images. Both Middle Island and Anniversary Island sit on the Spur Reef complex.  The total area of the atoll is 174\xa0km2 (66\xa0mi2) according to [1] , of which 30\xa0km2 (12\xa0mi2) are land, 17\xa0km2 (6.5\xa0mi2) peripheral reef and 124\xa0km2 (48\xa0mi2) are lagoon.  Climate  Eclipse Point  Annual rainfall averages 260\xa0cm (102\xa0in), with the heaviest precipitation from October to February. August, the driest month, averages 100\xa0mm (4.2\xa0in). Temperatures are generally close to 30°C (86 °F) by day, falling to the low 20s °C (70 °F) by night. Humidity is high throughout the year. The almost constant breeze keeps conditions reasonably comfortable.  Diego Garcia is at risk from tropical cyclones . The surrounding topography is low and does not provide an extensive wind break. Since the 1960s the island has not been seriously affected by a severe tropical cyclone, even though it has often been threatened. The maximum sustained wind associated with a tropical cyclone in the period 1970-2000 was approximately 40 knots (75\xa0km/h).

The Kalahari is a massive area of semi-arid savanna covering parts of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.  The Kalahari Desert in Namibia.  5. Description  The Kalahari Desert stretches across an area of 900,000 square kilometers, in the three African countries of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. Up to 70% of the land in Botswana, the eastern third of Namibia, and the northernmost parts of South Africa are all occupied by this desert. The Kalahari, unlike a true desert, has a semi-arid climate that supports vast tracts of sandy savanna, and a considerable diversity of flora and fauna lives therein. The landscape of the Kalahari is mostly flat, with an average elevation of around 1,000 meters above sea level in most parts of the desert. The Boteti River, in Botswana, is the only permanent surface water source in the desert.  4. Historical Role  Scientists estimate that the Kalahari Desert was formed between 65 and 135 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period. Since then, the desert has faced both periods of higher precipitation and greater aridity than the present prevailing conditions. It is possible that the dry riverbeds of the Kalahari and the Makgadikgadi Depression were formed during such periods of higher precipitation. Historical evidence proves that the San Bushmen of Africa were the ancient occupants of the Kalahari Desert region. The Bantu people, including tribes like the Tswana, the Kgalagadi, and the Herero, are currently residents of the desert along with the traditional San people, and these others arrived much later, towards the end of the 18th Century. In 1849, David Livingstone, a Scottish medical missionary, and William C. Oswell, an English explorer, were the first Europeans to cross the Kalahari Desert. In more recent years, Europeans arrived in the Kalahari primarily for commercial purposes, and only a single European settlement (in the Ghanzi District) existed in the region as late as the 1890’s.  3. Modern Significance  Presently, the Kalahari Desert serves as the homeland for Bantu-speaking African tribes and the Khoisan-speaking San people. The vast stretches of savanna in the region allow the locals to rear cattle and goats for meat and milk. Corn, sorghum, and pumpkins are also cultivated by most households in the region. The Kalahari Desert is home to large deposits of precious metals and diamonds. The first diamond mine was opened here in Orapa in 1971. Tourism also adds to the economy of the region. Besides the economical significance of the Kalahari, the desert is also extremely significant from the ecological and environmental points of view. The sands of the desert are packed with cyanobacteria which can fix atmospheric carbon dioxide, thus acting as a natural carbon sink for much of the world. The desert also houses some rare and endangered animals in its game reserves, including the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the Khutse Game Reserve, and the Kgalagadi Trans-frontier Park.  2. Habitat and Biodiversity  While the southwestern half of the Kalahari meets the requirements to be qualified as a desert, the northeastern portion of it receives a significant amount of precipitation, and thus cannot qualify as a true desert. There are great diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature throughout the Kalahari. While in summers day temperatures range between 43° and 46° Celsius, and night temperatures fall to between 21 degrees and 27° Celsius, in winters night temperatures can be as low as -12° Celsius. The arid areas of the southwestern Kalahari Desert support very little plant life, and are covered by vast stretches of xeric savanna comprised by xerophytic plants like savanna grasses, grey camelthorn, shepherd’s trees, and silver cluster-leafs. Several species of acacia grow in the less arid, central Kalahari region as well. The more humid northern parts of the desert, however, have large woodlands, palm trees, and even forests with evergreen and deciduous trees. Lions, cheetahs, giraffes, zebras, elephants, leopards, meerkats, and antelopes are just some of the mammalian species found in the northern Kalahari Desert | Question: The Kalahari Desert lies chiefly in which country?', ['botswana'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5997'), ("Context: While the overall race leader in the Tour de France will wear the yellow jersey , or `` maillot jaune '' , the green jersey ( `` maillot vert '' ) will be worn by the leader in the points competition .

The novel proved to critics that “Du Maurier is in a class by herself” (New York Times); her “masterful treatment” of her tale“made Rebecca a classic book” (Steinbrunner & Penzler, 136). “‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.’ The opening line of perhaps the greatest romantic suspense novel ever written has become as familiar to readers as ‘Call me Ishmael’ from Moby-Dick” (Penzler, Crown, 26).

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ("Context: Pocahontas is the seventh Disney Princess and first appeared in Disney 's 33rd animated feature film Pocahontas ( 1995 ) .

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.

The deaths of Billie Holiday, Lester Young, and Sidney Bechet, key artists of the music\'s earlier periods, intensified the pervasive sense that a new era was beginning. In New York, then as now the center of the jazz universe, major developments would set the musical agendas of jazz practitioners for decades to come. Charles Mingus recorded two masterworks, Blues & Roots and Mingus Ah Um, both revealing a novel way for large ensembles to perform complex music without the aid of written-out parts; John Coltrane, with Giant Steps, took vertical, change-running improvisation, an approach traceable all the way back to the first important jazz saxophonist, Coleman Hawkins, to its outer limits and logical conclusion; Miles Davis meanwhile, in the nick of time, nudged Trane toward a new pursuit with Kind of Blue, the modal jazz shot heard \'round the world and perhaps the best-known jazz recording of all time.  These developments alone would grant 1959 the status of an important, ground-breaking year in jazz. However, one event, a portent really, crowded out all others of that crowded year, insuring that the future of jazz really could be read in the tea leaves of 1959. In November, an outfit led by a weird Texas misfit made its New York debut at the Five Spot Cafe, consummating a year when the seeds of much of jazz\'s future were planted. The Ornette Coleman Quartet started a two week engagement (it was later extended to two and a half months), and the music was never the same again.  Coleman and his bandmates treated the harmonic aspect of jazz improvisation in a new way, disavowing the standard practice of running a tune\'s changes and following conventional song forms, in favor of a new approach where unfettered melodic inventiveness was the guiding force. As Coleman put it to writer Martin Williams: "If I\'m going to follow a preset chord sequence, I may as well write out my solo." In finding a way to chart this unfamiliar territory, Coleman took his place among jazz\'s most important innovators, alongside such stellar "establishment" figures as Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker.  Coleman, however, was not immediately given the key to the city. Thanks to the formidable press hype preceding his New York arrival, the jazz community there was quickly induced to take sides. Much of the criticism was downright personal, like Miles Davis\'s reaction: "Hell, just listen to what he writes and how he plays. If you\'re talking psychologically, the man\'s all screwed up inside." Years later, Ornette told record producer/writer John Snyder that one night during the Five Spot gig, Max Roach punched him in the mouth, then showed up at 4 o\'clock the next morning in front of his apartment building, hollering "I know you\'re up there, motherfucker! Come down here and I\'ll kick your ass!"  Not that rejection was a new experience for Ornette Coleman. The first chapters of John Litweiler\'s new biography, Ornette Coleman: A Harmolodic Life, read nearly like a catalog of abuse: Ornette as a teenager in Fort Worth, being held up by his church bandleader as an example of how not to play ("he\'ll never be a saxophone player"); Ornette being fired on the spot from various gigs for solo breaks that stopped dancers in their tracks -- not with admiration, but with anger and alarm; Ornette, touring with a blues band, meeting local musicians who take him outside, beat him bloody and unconscious, and trash his horn; Ornette, sitting in with Dexter Gordon\'s rhythm section in L.A., being ordered by Dex to scram.  Litweiler faced no easy task in pinning down the real story of this enigmatic trailblazer.

Considered the showpiece of the Florida Panhandle—a stretch of land that spans 200 miles along the northwestern region of the state—Tallahassee offers attractions such as well-preserved historical sites, plenty of outdoor recreation and access to sports, nightlife and shopping.  Explore state history at the Capitol Complex in downtown Tallahassee. For a “before and after” look, first view the Historical Capitol, topped with a dome and cupola and restored to its 1902 state. The vintage building holds a two-floor exhibit area joined by a grand staircase, which stands in sharp contrast to the “extreme makeover” modern skyscraper that houses the New Capitol next door. Other things to do at the Tallahassee Capitol Complex include touring the Florida Supreme Court, styled in a mix of Greek Revival and Jeffersonian architecture, and the Florida Governor’s Mansion, a Georgian manor built in the fashion of the grand plantation homes.  Nearby, the Museum of Florida History documents the layered evolution of the state. Changing exhibits have examined topics ranging from Seminole native culture to the representation of Florida in modern-day artifacts.  Visitors to Tallahassee can explore the diverse natural surroundings of the area, including a 78-mile network of canopy roads around the city. Compact, curvy and draped with moss-covered trees—live oaks, hickory and pines among them—each of the nine canopy roads of Tallahassee splays in a different direction, offering a distinct landscape to intrepid travelers.  Outdoor attractions in Tallahassee range from paddling down a tree-draped river to biking in a downtown park. Popular tourist destinations include the Tallahassee Museum, a 52-acre natural campus where visitors can identify plants and observe wildlife, including alligators and panthers, from an elevated wood foot path. Tallahassee Tree to Tree Adventures, located at the museum, offers visitors the chance to zipline through a variety of rugged natural settings.  Tallahassee’s strong sports scene is powered by the academic institutions in the city’s midst, notably the football teams of Florida State University and Florida A and M University. The Seminoles of Florida State and Rattlers of Florida A and M play to packed crowds at local stadiums. Each fall, football fans head downtown to Adams Street Commons on Friday nights for Downtown GetDown, a lively rally in support of the formidable teams.  The city manages a busy calendar of festivals, holiday celebrations and other year-round things to do. Downtown Tallahassee is home to a seasonal open-air market held on Saturdays in Ponce de Leon Park. Vendors sell items ranging from plants and organic produce to arts and crafts. The Downtown Market is enhanced by live music and author readings. On the first Friday of each month, crowds of locals and visitors head to the First Friday Gallery Hop at Railroad Square, a former lumber yard in downtown Tallahassee that is now home to over 50 eclectic shops, galleries and art studios.

Before he changed the music industry with songs like "Ring of Fire" and "Folsom Prison Blues," Johnny Cash spent his hardscrabble childhood in the small community of Dyess, Arkansas.  The Johnny Cash Boyhood Home, the newest of Arkansas State University\'s Heritage Sites, opens Saturday for public tours after a restoration project that includes other historic buildings.  When visitors walk into the home, they are stepping back into the 1930s.  Cash family artifacts original to the home include the piano that belonged to Johnny\'s mother, his father\'s shaving mug and even the original flooring in his childhood bedroom and the living room. The living room linoleum still has burn marks caused by the wood-burning stove.  Other furnishings and objects are of the time period and mostly contributed by donors, said Ruth Hawkins, director of Arkansas Heritage Sites at Arkansas State University. They are based on the photos and memories of Tommy Cash and Joanne Cash Yates, two of Johnny Cash\'s siblings.  Period details include a pedestal sewing machine, a battery-operated radio like one Johnny Cash would play at night and the living-room sofa. The period icebox and corner cabinet were painted the apple-green color the siblings remember.  The Dyess Colony was a federal agricultural resettlement community created in 1934, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s New Deal program in response to the Great Depression.  The colony provided homes and jobs for about 500 poor farm families, including the Cash family.  Johnny, called JR at the time, was 3 years old when his family moved into a Dyess home in 1935.  Johnny spent his childhood in Dyess, attending school and church in the town. He also suffered an enormous loss when his brother Jack was killed in a sawmill accident in 1944.  Cash left "JR" behind and became Johnny when he left Arkansas for the Air Force in 1950.  Arkansas was an important influence on Cash, who told audiences how "Five Feet High and Rising" and many of his other songs were influenced by his time living in Dyess.  "The little church in Dyess, Arkansas, has been such an inspiration to me, and (so have) the people from Dyess," Cash said at the 40th reunion of Dyess High School in 1990, in a video exhibited at the Dyess Colony Museum.  Cash died in 2003, leaving four daughters from his first marriage to Vivian Liberto. Cash and his second wife, singer June Carter Cash, had a son together. June Carter Cash died earlier in 2003.  The annual Johnny Cash Music Festival , which starts on Friday in nearby Jonesboro, has raised almost $2 million to fund the restoration project. Headliners for this year\'s sold-out festival include Reba McEntire, Bobby Bare and Loretta Lynn, who are donating their performances, as have artists in previous years.  With the restoration of Cash\'s childhood home and nearby Dyess Colony Administration Building complete, work has already begun on the restoration of the historic Dyess Theatre adjacent to the administration building, to be used as a visitor center.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

On the far side of the Rock is the New Town of Fontvieille, where a number of F1 old and New drivers live.  The Circuit:  Monaco is unique, and to many the annual blast round the streets of the tiny principality represents the jewel in the crown of Formula One. With its legendary casino and countless rows of millionaires' yachts in the harbour, Monaco is a glamorous place that lies at the very heart of the jet-set. It is also unique in that for many of the drivers the race is run on their doorstep, with the same streets they use for a daily trip to the newsagents, transformed into a race track.  Winding through the streets it is a circuit that has remained remarkably unchanged since the first race was staged in 1929. Before the war the circuit was witness to several great battles, with the legendary Tazio Nuvolari often among the winners. When World Championship racing began in 1950 Monaco played host to the second race, just a week after the first round at Silverstone. That race resulted in a massive pile-up on the very first lap and provided Fangio with his first ever championship victory. Since then the race has been plagued by a high attrition rate that has thrown up some unusual victories over the years. The combination of narrow roads, high kerbs and the close proximity of some unforgiving crash barriers, many a great driver has suffered at the hands of a track that quickly punishes the slightest error in judgement.  One memorable race came in 1955, the year that is best remembered for Alberto Ascari's trip into the harbour, a feat that was later emulated by the Australian driver Paul Hawkins. Both men survived their dunking although a number of driver's have not been so lucky. Luigi Fagioli was killed in a sports car race here in 1952 and Lorenzo Bandini was burned to death in 1967. Other driver's have far happier memories of the place. Graham Hill, for years known as 'Mister Monaco', won here five times. A record he held until the arrival of Ayrton Senna.

As with many monastic cheeses, this variety is matured in humid cave-like conditions. The rind is washed in perry because the 100 or so varieties of perry pear known nationally are peculiar to this part of Gloucestershire and its border areas.  One of these varieties is ‘Stinking Bishop’, a name which seems appropriate for this cheese.  The Stinking Bishop pear was in turn named after a local mid 19th Century farmer called Frederick Bishop.  He earned himself the nick-name 'Stinking Bishop' because of his riotous behaviour.  He once took a cow to market and determined to drink the proceeds before he went home - he did, and then when the kettle was too slow to boil he shot it!

Milk of rare Gloucester cattle is used to produce the cheese though\xa0sometimes their milk is mixed with the milk of Fresian cattle.  Made with vegetarian rennet, this cheese is also suitable for vegetarians. The rind is washed in perry, an alcoholic drink made with the local variety of Stinking Bishop pear, which gives the cheese its name. The alcoholic wash gives the cheese its distinctive pungent aroma and brown/pink rind colour. As a result of the natural rind, changeable hues of mold spots appear on the cheese from time to time.  This unique cheese dates its history to the Cistercian order of monks. To keep up with the tradition of monastic cheeses, Stinking Bishop is also matured in humid cave-like conditions.  The colour of the cheese paste varies from white-yellow to beige, with an orange to grey rind. It is available in 5lbs wheels, each measuring 8-inches in diameter and 2-inches deep. The affinage takes from six to eight weeks. Stinking Bishop is produced in very limited quantities but its stinky smell has made it very popular in the United Kingdom and abroad.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Edith Cresson was born January 27, 1934, in a fashionable Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Her father was a senior civil servant. Raised by a British nanny, she became fluent in the English language. Cresson attended the School of Advanced Commercial Studies, earning a degree in business and later a doctorate in demography.  A successful businesswoman, she added a second career in politics when she met François Mitterrand in 1965. For the next 26 years the future president helped Cresson advance through the ranks of what is now the French Socialist Party, calling her "my little soldier."  After Mitterrand became president in 1981, Cresson served first as minister of agriculture (1981-1983), then as minister of external trade and tourism (1983-1984), as minister of industrial restructuring and external trade (1984-1986), and finally minister of foreign affairs (1988-1990). She resigned from the government on October 3, 1990, to work as a consultant on international development. Meanwhile she was three times elected a deputy to the National Assembly from the Vienne province (1981, 1986, 1988).  Then in May 1991, President Mitterrand asked Cresson to form a new government. Some experts believe Mitterand had grown dissatisfied with the failures of the government of Michel Rocard to gain majorities in the National Assembly.   Others believe the French president foresaw major international trade issues looming as the trans-European Union came into existence, and sought Cresson\'s expertise in trade affairs.  As prime minister, the combative Cresson planned to strengthen France\'s industrial power and to "protect" French and European trade from the inroads of Japanese and American products. In assembling her new cabinet of 29 members she chose a number of holdovers from the government of her predecessor. One, Pierre Brgovoy, was named to head a new superministry combining economic, trade, industrial, and technology affairs. His appointment served to restore trust in the French leadership in financial markets. She also appointed five women, three to posts in labor, development, and youth and sports.  When her appointment to prime minister drew misogynist remarks from some politicians of France\'s center and right parties, Cresson said, "Men are not in any sense irreplaceable except in one\'s private life." Nevertheless, more fair-minded criticism about her ability to command majorities in the National Assembly persisted.  The Cresson government moved aggressively to free what had become a stagnant economy, and on contentious domestic issues, frequently centered around immigrants. Quoted making strident and antagonistic comments about the Japanese "strategy of conquest," Cresson was greatly concerned over what she was convinced to be Japan\'s major threat to European trade and commonwealth. Diplomatically, her outspokenness was creating unease in international circles. Within four months of becoming president, the Cresson government had fallen precipitously in popularity. Subtle and not-so-subtle attacks on her gender continued, including a popular daytime television show featuring two puppet characters, one a sexy and servile female broadly seen as a Cresson parody. In April 1992, Cresson resigned. Since then she has served as Commissioner for Science, Research and Development to the European Commission.  Cresson\'s husband, Jacques, a retired executive of Peugeot, the French automobile and appliance company, remained supportive of his wife, and their relationship has been likened to that of Margaret Thatcher and her husband. Cresson has been compared to the British prime minister for her bluntness, energy, and stubbornness. They have two daughters.  Further Reading on Edith Cresson  The appointment and career of Cresson was covered in the Washington Post (May 16 and May 18, 1991). See also "An Iron Lady Across the Channel?"

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Ian Fleming.  Doesn\'t have quite the same ring to it as the more famous  Bond. James Bond, does it? Nevertheless, the creator of the charming rogue spy was English author and journalist Ian Lancaster Fleming (not Ian Flemming, though it is a very common misspelling) born in London in 1908. Ian Fleming was raised in England, part of a privileged upper-class family with as much prestige, respect and social standing as wealth. When Fleming\'s father, Valentine Fleming, died, his obituary was written by Winston Churchill .  Fleming attended Eton College and was always fascinated by words, studying languages such as German and French, and developing an interest in writing early on. It ran in the family - his brother Peter was a travel writer.  Fleming also had a keen interest in military and government and was a personal assistant and Intelligence officer in the Royal Navy during World War II. Fleming\'s military career is more thoroughly detailed in the BBC miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond, which premiered on American tv in January 2014. The role of Ian Fleming is played by actor Dominic Cooper.  Fleming\'s attraction to the military may be attributable to his father, who was a war hero killed in World War I. Regardless, Fleming\'s  work during the war likely provided background for his James Bond stories, and many of the people, places and particulars of his novels are purported to be based on real details of Fleming\'s life. For instance, during his time in the Naval Reserve, his known code name was 17F, which could have given him the later idea for Agent 007, also known as, you guessed, it, James Bond. The prep school he attended growing up was next to the estate of a family called Bond, whose family motto was "The World is Not Enough". And during his time in WWII, Fleming was integral in developing a secret communication plan whose code name was Operation Goldeneye.  All in all, Agent 007\'s exploits can be enjoyed in Fleming\'s 14 James Bond books , starting with Casino Royale (1953), and going forward through Live and Let Die (1954), Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956), From Russia with Love (1957), Dr. No (1958), Goldfinger (1959), For Your Eyes Only (1960), Thunderball (1961), The Spy Who Loved Me (1962), On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service (1963), You Only Live Twice (1964), The Man with the Golden Gun (1965), and Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966).  While he is best known for James Bond, Fleming also wrote two non-fiction books, The Diamond Smugglers (1957) and Thrilling Cities (1963) as well as a children\'s book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1964).  Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker. After a heart attack in 1961, he succumbed to his next one and died in 1964.  To commemorate the centenary of Fleming\'s birth, a book titled Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks (writing as Ian Fleming) was released in 2008 and breathed new life into Bond. There were other writers who tried their hand at the James Bond franchise, including Kingsley Amis (writing as Robert Markham) and John Gardner .  There are many biographies about Fleming; among the most notable are The Life of Ian Fleming by John Pearson and Ian Fleming by Andrew Lycett.

Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities . Even universities were made `` tribal '' , and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools .

The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb. Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films. A few years later, this kind of thing would be done better with WHERE EAGLES DARE. It's kind of hard to accept Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris as Norwegians, not surprisingly the Swedish Ulla Jacobsson (Bergman's SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT) is more convincing.

Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.

The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes.

But it all worked out, and the fourth film, titled Jurassic World , was released in 2015.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ("Context: Eldridge Industries  Eldridge Industries, LLC is a Private equity investment holdings firm owned by Todd Boehly, the former president of Guggenheim Partners.

The deaths of Billie Holiday, Lester Young, and Sidney Bechet, key artists of the music\'s earlier periods, intensified the pervasive sense that a new era was beginning. In New York, then as now the center of the jazz universe, major developments would set the musical agendas of jazz practitioners for decades to come. Charles Mingus recorded two masterworks, Blues & Roots and Mingus Ah Um, both revealing a novel way for large ensembles to perform complex music without the aid of written-out parts; John Coltrane, with Giant Steps, took vertical, change-running improvisation, an approach traceable all the way back to the first important jazz saxophonist, Coleman Hawkins, to its outer limits and logical conclusion; Miles Davis meanwhile, in the nick of time, nudged Trane toward a new pursuit with Kind of Blue, the modal jazz shot heard \'round the world and perhaps the best-known jazz recording of all time.  These developments alone would grant 1959 the status of an important, ground-breaking year in jazz. However, one event, a portent really, crowded out all others of that crowded year, insuring that the future of jazz really could be read in the tea leaves of 1959. In November, an outfit led by a weird Texas misfit made its New York debut at the Five Spot Cafe, consummating a year when the seeds of much of jazz\'s future were planted. The Ornette Coleman Quartet started a two week engagement (it was later extended to two and a half months), and the music was never the same again.  Coleman and his bandmates treated the harmonic aspect of jazz improvisation in a new way, disavowing the standard practice of running a tune\'s changes and following conventional song forms, in favor of a new approach where unfettered melodic inventiveness was the guiding force. As Coleman put it to writer Martin Williams: "If I\'m going to follow a preset chord sequence, I may as well write out my solo." In finding a way to chart this unfamiliar territory, Coleman took his place among jazz\'s most important innovators, alongside such stellar "establishment" figures as Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker.  Coleman, however, was not immediately given the key to the city. Thanks to the formidable press hype preceding his New York arrival, the jazz community there was quickly induced to take sides. Much of the criticism was downright personal, like Miles Davis\'s reaction: "Hell, just listen to what he writes and how he plays. If you\'re talking psychologically, the man\'s all screwed up inside." Years later, Ornette told record producer/writer John Snyder that one night during the Five Spot gig, Max Roach punched him in the mouth, then showed up at 4 o\'clock the next morning in front of his apartment building, hollering "I know you\'re up there, motherfucker! Come down here and I\'ll kick your ass!"  Not that rejection was a new experience for Ornette Coleman. The first chapters of John Litweiler\'s new biography, Ornette Coleman: A Harmolodic Life, read nearly like a catalog of abuse: Ornette as a teenager in Fort Worth, being held up by his church bandleader as an example of how not to play ("he\'ll never be a saxophone player"); Ornette being fired on the spot from various gigs for solo breaks that stopped dancers in their tracks -- not with admiration, but with anger and alarm; Ornette, touring with a blues band, meeting local musicians who take him outside, beat him bloody and unconscious, and trash his horn; Ornette, sitting in with Dexter Gordon\'s rhythm section in L.A., being ordered by Dex to scram.  Litweiler faced no easy task in pinning down the real story of this enigmatic trailblazer.

See More  Solitaire (Jane Seymour) - James Bond Wiki - WikiaSolitaire (Jane Seymour) | James Bond Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Solitaire is a fictional character in the James Bond novel and film Live and Let Die . In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .  The pair are tied up and left to be eaten by sharks, but Bond manages to free himself and defeat Kananga, allowing the pair to escape once more.  Later, on the train,\xa0she beats Bond at gin rummy and tries to have a quiet night before Tee Hee traps her in the bed, believing Bond did it. After Bond kills Tee Hee, he rescues her out of the bed and they soon make out.

The population was 6,690 at the 2010 census.  The town is named after American patriot Alexander Hamilton.   Alexander Hamilton  Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation\'s financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and "The New York Post" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.  They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking. | Question: When was the American patriot Hamilton, New York Wass named after born?', ['January 11, 1755 or 1757July'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-945'), ('Context: Rob (TV series)  Rob (stylized in promos as ¡Rob!)  is an American sitcom television series that premiered on CBS on January 12, 2012, at 8:30 pm (ET) as a mid-season replacement for "Rules of Engagement", and ended on March 1, 2012.

Edit  Storyline  Kirsty Wark Hosts live coverage of the prestigious Booker Prize, from Guildhall in London. This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century.

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies. Skylab was 30.2 metres (99 feet) in length and 6.7 metres (22 feet) in diameter and had a mass of about 75,000 kg (165,000 pounds). Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research. Its main scientific instrument, the Apollo Telescope Mount , incorporated a number of component telescopes and other devices for observing the Sun over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum , from visible light through X-rays .

During Skylab’s ascent a thermal meteoroid shield was ripped off, which led to the loss of one of the lateral solar power arrays that was to supply electricity to the station and prevented full extension of the other. The first three-man crew deployed an improvised “parasol” sunshade (later fortified with an overlying sun shield) to prevent serious overheating of the station during their 28-day mission and released the jammed solar array. Skylab hosted two additional three-man crews for missions lasting 59 and 84 days. Each of the three Skylab missions set a new space endurance record. Although plans called for Skylab to be used again with one of the first space shuttle missions boosting it to a higher orbit, increased solar activity caused its orbit to degrade faster than expected.

What is the History of Fleet Street?  charlesdickenspage.com  Main Image:\xa0  Fleet Street is the name of a popular street in London that was once the centre of British Press and Journalism. Up till the 1980s most of the Offices of the British press was housed on Fleet Street. Today many media agencies have moved out of Fleet Street but the Street continues to represent the British Press. The Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. The tube stations nearest to Fleet Street are Chancery Lane, Temple and Blackfriars. There are many streets in London which may surpass the Fleet Street in its architectural design but the Fleet Street is regarded historically as one of London’s important streets.  Content  \xa0  What is the Etymology of Fleet Street?  The name Fleet Street is derived from the name of River Fleet that is now an underground stream. Fleet street once had all the important newspaper offices almost till the 1980.s However by 2005 the last of the British press agencies, the Reuters left Fleet Sreet. The Street is so strongly linked with British Journalists that even now it is used synonymously for the British Press.  \xa0  \xa0  What is the History of Fleet Street?\xa0  The use of the name Fleet Street can be dated back to the 13th century when it was known as Fleet Bridge Street. Around the 14th century the Street came to be known by its present usage. Publishing began in Fleet Street with the setting up of a printing shop by Wynkyn de Worde,apprentice to William Caxton. Around the same time, Richard Pynson set up his publishing and printing office near St. Dunstan’s Church. This was followed by a number of other publishers and printers with The Daily Courant-London;s first daily paper setting up its premises on Fleet Street in March 1702.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  Where is Fleet Street Located?\xa0  The Street named as Fleet Street started from the City of London and extended till WestmininserThe Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. In former times the River Fleet acted like the boundary of the medieval city of London,enforced by walls to ward off any foreign invasions. The construction of the Fleet Street in the city London marked the expansion of London in the early 14th century. While the River Fleet flowed at the East end of the street,the West end is marked by the Temple Bar ,setting the city limits. To the south of the Fleet Street lies The Temple, which is a complex of buildings formerly owned by the Knights Templar.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  What is the Status of the Present Day Fleet Street?  Fleet Street is now associated with law as its inns and chambers are occupied by barristers, mostly located in down alleys from where the former newspaper offices have moved to Wapping and Canary Wharf.The office occupied by “The Daily Telegraph ” has now become the headquarters of Goldman Sachs,an nvestment bank. Another private bank,C.Hoare&Co. has been based on Fleet Street since 1690. However a number of British New agencies such as D.C Thomas & Co, Commonwealth Broadcasting Associatio,\xa0\xa0continue to function from Fleet Street.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Trinidad, by far the larger of the two main islands, has an area of about 1,850 square miles (4,800 square km). It is 7 miles (11 km) from the Venezuelan coast at its nearest point and is separated from it by the Gulf of Paria and two narrow channels, where there are several small islands and rocks.

The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city. The nickname became more commonplace in the years that followed.

Nicknames can help establish the identity of a city. They can also spread pride among its citizens.  New Orleans, Louisiana probably has more nicknames than any other American city. One web site lists more than twenty nicknames. The most famous is “The Big Easy.” It describes the gentle, slow and easy-going way of life in New Orleans.  Bourbon Street in New Orleans  So how did the city get this nickname? In the early 1900s there was a dance hall in New Orleans called “The Big Easy.” But the nickname did not become famous until the early 1970s. That was when a Louisiana newspaper writer began calling New Orleans by this name. She compared the easy-going way of life there to the hurried pace of life in New York City.  In 1970, James Conaway wrote a crime novel called “The Big Easy.” The story was set in New Orleans. In 1987, that book was made into a film which made the nickname even more popular.  New Orleans has other nicknames. One of them is “The Crescent City.” During the 19th century, new neighborhoods expanded out from what is now known as the French Quarter. These areas followed the great curve of the Mississippi River, giving New Orleans the shape of a crescent.  Port of New Orleans  Another nickname is “The Birthplace of Jazz,” because that kind of music started in New Orleans. It is also called “Mardi Gras City” for the wild celebrations and parades that take place there every year. And, there is a nickname that uses the short way to write New Orleans and Louisiana. It you do not want to use the complete name, you can call the city “NOLA.”  One of America’s most exciting cities is Las Vegas, Nevada. There you can play games of chance all night long. The city’s nightclubs are also open all night for eating, drinking and dancing.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

It goes that as his children (my father and aunt) were starving to break the fast on Yom Kippur, they\'d peer out the apartment window, waiting to spot him walking back from synagogue. He\'d take his sweet time, pull off his coat and hat, open a rarely used cabinet, blow the dust off an old bottle, take a sip of something, make a face, then announce that everyone could eat.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  That old bottle contained a liquid known as Slivovitz, which is pronounced differently all over Central and Eastern Europe, but in my family we call it "Shleeve-O-Wits." I\'m not saying we pronounced it correctly, and frankly, when we refer to it at all, we usually call it "that rocket fuel."  Slivovitz is a type of high-proof plum brandy that was popular with Jewish grandfathers because it\'s not only kosher, but since it contains no grain, it\'s also kosher-for-Passover (which is, like, extra kosher.) The only mention of it in any American movie I can think of is in Barry Levinson\'s Avalon, where they are reminiscing about the long-deceased family patriarch. Now, Slivovitz is, at first taste, absolutely repulsive, but it is a window into a galaxy of exciting, robust liquors that don\'t get much play in the United States. Luckily I\'m here to help you sort it out, because it can get confusing.  Most Popular  We can broadly categorize Slivovitz and the other strange spirits I\'m about to offer up as fruit brandies, but don\'t let that connote anything sweet or syrupy. In Germany, the catch-all term is Schnapps, which, again, may suggest an ultra-sugary dessert you sip over a game of bridge. The French call it Eau-de-Vie, which means "water of life," but don\'t confuse it with Scandinavian Aquavit or Irish tub whiskey. In Balkan countries they call it Rakia, which is easily confused with the anise-based Turkish drink Raki, and the Hungarians call it Pálinka. It\'s really just a distilled, fermented fruit beverage with an alcoholic punch that could knock a Cossack off his horse. They\'re almost always 80 proof or more, but the fruit flavoring isn\'t there to mask the alcohol. It adds a taste sensation that\'s all about being bright and present and opening your eyes real wide and making you say "whooooaaaaaaaaaa!" before you pass the bottle to your friend to dare him to take as big of a sip.  Have we got all that? Okay! Now, friends of mine know I\'ve been tasting and collecting Central European fruit brandies for years—to the point that few can escape my home without me shoving a shot of something exotically, gloriously putrid in their face.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.

In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").

Nominal weight  6 weeks from despatch date  Packaging  Beechwood lath and waxed paper  Waxed Paper and Wooden Box  Please note this cheese has a natural rind and may therefore carry mould spots of varying interesting hues from time to time.  History: A monastic type of cheese which owes its origin to the Cistercian order of monks who once farmed the pastures of  Hunts Court Farm whence it was launched in 1994.  As with many monastic cheeses, this variety is matured in humid cave-like conditions. The rind is washed in perry because the 100 or so varieties of perry pear known nationally are peculiar to this part of Gloucestershire and its border areas.  One of these varieties is ‘Stinking Bishop’, a name which seems appropriate for this cheese.  The Stinking Bishop pear was in turn named after a local mid 19th Century farmer called Frederick Bishop.  He earned himself the nick-name 'Stinking Bishop' because of his riotous behaviour.  He once took a cow to market and determined to drink the proceeds before he went home - he did, and then when the kettle was too slow to boil he shot it!

Milk of rare Gloucester cattle is used to produce the cheese though\xa0sometimes their milk is mixed with the milk of Fresian cattle.  Made with vegetarian rennet, this cheese is also suitable for vegetarians. The rind is washed in perry, an alcoholic drink made with the local variety of Stinking Bishop pear, which gives the cheese its name. The alcoholic wash gives the cheese its distinctive pungent aroma and brown/pink rind colour. As a result of the natural rind, changeable hues of mold spots appear on the cheese from time to time.  This unique cheese dates its history to the Cistercian order of monks. To keep up with the tradition of monastic cheeses, Stinking Bishop is also matured in humid cave-like conditions.  The colour of the cheese paste varies from white-yellow to beige, with an orange to grey rind. It is available in 5lbs wheels, each measuring 8-inches in diameter and 2-inches deep. The affinage takes from six to eight weeks. Stinking Bishop is produced in very limited quantities but its stinky smell has made it very popular in the United Kingdom and abroad.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

The law, which had been passed in March, made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.” With local businessman George Rappalyea, Scopes had conspired to get charged with this violation, and after his arrest the pair enlisted the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to organize a defense. Hearing of this coordinated attack on Christian fundamentalism, William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential candidate and a fundamentalist hero, volunteered to assist the prosecution. Soon after, the great attorney Clarence Darrow agreed to join the ACLU in the defense, and the stage was set for one of the most famous trials in U.S. history.  On July 10, the Monkey Trial got underway, and within a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the city’s main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day’s proceeding with prayer.  Outside, Dayton took on a carnival-like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed “missing link” opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact Jo Viens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51-year-old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees–named Joe Mendi–wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton’s citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.  In the courtroom, Judge Raulston destroyed the defense’s strategy by ruling that expert scientific testimony on evolution was inadmissible–on the grounds that it was Scopes who was on trial, not the law he had violated. The next day, Raulston ordered the trial moved to the courthouse lawn, fearing that the weight of the crowd inside was in danger of collapsing the floor.  In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was subjected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictory statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed. Under Tennessee law, Bryan was thereby denied the opportunity to deliver the closing speech he had been preparing for weeks. After eight minutes of deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict, and Raulston ordered Scopes to pay a fine of $100, the minimum the law allowed. Although Bryan had won the case, he had been publicly humiliated and his fundamentalist beliefs had been disgraced.

This decision was actuated by an air raid on London in 1940 during which the Royal Palace was hit. After this incident, King George became emotionally more involved with his people and he realised what they had to go through during the raids, admiring even more their hardships and heroism. As a result, the George Cross and George Medal were largely designed by him.  The George Cross is the second highest British decoration and is awarded for "acts of the greatest heroism and bravery in circumstances of extreme danger". It was initially awarded to all citizens of the Commonwealth and was later extended to military personnel for actions that did not usually merit a military decoration. Recipients are entitled to add the letters GC after their names. Bars will be awarded for subsequent acts of bravery and the decoration can be awarded posthumously.  The GC is the successor to the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry and its recipients were obliged to return it to the Central Chancellery of the Orders of Knighthood to have it replaced by a George Cross. In 1971, recipients of the Albert Medal could also exchange this for a George Cross.  The badge is made of silver. On the front is an image of St. George fighting the dragon surrounded by the inscription \'For Gallantry\', on the reverse are engraved the name of the recipient and the date of the award. Each arm of the cross bears the cypher of the reigning Monarch, during the war GRI or GRVI, after the war EIIR. The cross hangs from a silver bar adorned with laurel leaves by a silver ring. The ribbon is 1.75" (38 mm) wide and coloured blue with a miniature GC in its centre.

The bill was the outcome of years of suffragette meetings in towns and cities across the country, with women often traveling considerable distances to hear lectures and speeches, pass resolutions, and sign petitions. New Zealand women first went to the polls in the national elections of November 1893.  The United States granted women the right to vote in 1920, and Great Britain guaranteed full voting rights for women in 1928.

Courtesy of the State Library of South Australia.  Suffrage, or the right to vote, is something that Australians have not always been able to take for granted. In 1902, Australia was the first country in the world to give women both the right to vote in federal elections and also the right to be elected to parliament on a national basis. New Zealand granted women the right to vote in 1893.  Commonwealth women's suffrage in Australia reflected the rights of women to seek election in South Australia and to vote in Western Australia, rights granted in 1895 and 1899 respectively. Indigenous people as a group were not granted suffrage in federal elections until 1962, although South Australia granted suffrage to Aboriginal women as early as 1894, and the Commonwealth Constitution stated that anyone with a state vote was entitled to a Commonwealth vote.  'Suffragettes' was a term used around the world to describe all women who campaigned for the right to vote in elections. From the 1880s and through the 1890s each Australian colony had at least one suffragette society. These societies published leaflets; organised debates, public meetings and letter-writing campaigns; and arranged deputations to members of their colonial parliaments. In 1891, suffragettes including Vida Goldstein gathered 30,000 women's signatures and presented them as a petition to the Victorian Parliament. In 1894, Mary Lee and others presented a petition from 11,600 women in South Australia and the Northern Territory.  The suffragettes argued that women should be able to vote and stand for election because the wishes of women should be reflected in parliament. They argued that a government 'by the people' should include government by women, because laws affect women as much as they do men.  Politics and Australian women in the nineteenth century  Men govern the world and the schemes upon which all our institutions are founded show men's thoughts only.

Courtesy of the Parliament of Victoria.  In the 19th century, a woman's place was still very firmly in the home. Although small numbers of women were attending university and seeking a career for themselves, most women's lives were restricted to the home and the exhausting physical work of maintaining a house and raising a family.  The thought that a woman was capable of focusing her attention on matters such as politics was incomprehensible to many men, and some women, who opposed the fight for female suffrage. They portrayed women as emotional, weak and unable to make decisions as well as being consumed with domestic and trivial matters.  Nineteenth century civilisation has accorded to women the same political status as to the idiot and the criminal. Such is the basis of our reverence for the person of women and of our estimate of her work.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

The girl, just turned six, is improving her counting by determinedly calling out the number of each step.  ‘Thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-NINE!’ she says in triumph as they step off onto the sand.  Thus Alice Buchan gave the title to her father’s, my grandfather’s, new novel, little knowing that it would prove to be one of the most enduring adventure stories ever to be published.  John Buchan wrote The 39 Steps in a few weeks towards the end of 1914, while staying with his wife and children at Broadstairs in Kent, in a house on the cliffs overlooking Stone Bay. (The house is still there; indeed, anyone wishing to re-enact the novel’s finale may rent it as a holiday let.)  While there, he became ill with the duodenal problems that plagued him all his life, and which had prevented him from joining the Army, Britain having declared war against Germany on August 4 that year. Two major elements among these facts – the clifftop setting and the coming of war – infuse what has come to be widely regarded as the first modern spy thriller.  Buchan posted the manuscript to Blackwood & Sons in Edinburgh, publisher not only of books but of the famous literary magazine that bore its name.  ‘It has amused me to write, but whether it will amuse you to read is another matter,’ he wrote.  He need not have fretted. Blackwood’s accepted it at once and published it in the magazine, in serial form and pseudonymously, between July and September 1915, and as a book under Buchan’s name in October. It was an immediate success – and more than that, it has become a classic of its kind.  Today, the principal charges levelled against the novel are that it is dated, and that it relies too heavily upon improbable circumstances or coincidences. Yet I would argue that even now, almost 100 years after it was first published, the story retains a modernity that is little short of astonishing.  Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, released in 1935, is an extremely well-made comedy thriller that's widely and deservedly admired  I am reminded of its place in our collective narrative by a cartoon I clipped from a newspaper a few years ago and pinned to my office wall. It shows a boy of about eight, standing in front of his parents.  He is wearing a tweed Norfolk jacket, a tie, breeches, chequered shooting stockings and what are no doubt stout brogues. Eyes closed as in serious thought, he is drawing on a pipe clamped between his teeth, the bowl of which he’s holding in his left hand. In his right, half wedged beneath his arm, he holds a copy of The 39 Steps. Anxiously, his mother is saying to her husband, ‘Why doesn’t he read Harry Potter, like other kids?’ Why indeed?  True, The 39 Steps isn’t read by the young (or old) in anything like the numbers that JK Rowling’s marvellous creation attracts, but it’s still in print nearly 100 years after its first publication; indeed, it has never been out of print, something that isn’t true of the works of, for instance, Jane Austen.

The All Blacks are the holders of the Rugby World Cup and are the 2013 International Rugby Board (IRB) Team of the Year as well as having the 2013 player of the year Kieran Read and coach of the year Steve Hansen. In 2012 the All Blacks won Team, Player and Coach of the year and in 2011 the team won Team and Coach of the year after winning the Rugby World Cup. They have won over 76% of their Test matches and are the leading Test match points scorers of all time. They are the only international side with a winning record against every country they have played, and since their international debut in 1903 only five nations have defeated New Zealand in Test matches. Since the introduction of the IRB's world rankings in October 2003, New Zealand has held number one ranking longer than all other teams combined.  New Zealand compete with Argentina, Australia and South Africa in The Rugby Championship—known as the Tri Nations before Argentina's entry in 2012. The All Blacks have won the trophy twelve times in the competition's eighteen-year history. They also hold the Bledisloe Cup, which is contested annually with Australia, and the Freedom Cup, contested annually with South Africa. New Zealand have achieved a Grand Slam (defeating England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in one tour) four times—1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010.  This video is targeted to blind users.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.  The phrase is now used internationally and it’s not surprising it has become the third most known slogan of all time.  \xa0  \xa0  [1] The phrase is a registered trademark of Ronseal’s owner, the Sherwin-Williams Company , across the European Community for products including paints, varnishes and wood preservatives (E3085826)  [3] Source Creative Review February 2012  \xa0  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tinThe Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin - BBC News  BBC News  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin  8 January 2013  Read more about sharing.  Close share panel  Prime Minister David Cameron used a famous advertising slogan to sum up the state of the coalition government at its halfway point, saying "it is a Ronseal deal - it does what it says on the tin". This phrase has entered the British vernacular, says its co-creator Dave Shelton.  David Cameron has said it before. In 2004, he said: "People are crying out for a kind of Ronseal politics - they want it to do what it says on the tin."  People use the phrase every day. On YouTube you can listen to Katie Melua\'s What It Says On The Tin . Google the line and you get millions of results.

Mount Meager is a potentially active volcano in the Canadian province of British Columbia , Canada , 150 kilometers north of Vancouver . The top of the mountain is mostly covered by snow and glaciers . It lies in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is the northernmost volcano of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that extends down to northern California . Its most common type of rock is lava that is almost a million years old (with a thickness in some places over 1\xa0km).  The mountain is part of the Pacific Ranges of mountains and is 2,680 meters (8,793 feet) high. It was previously called Cathedral Mountain.  Geologic history  Meager is known for its last major eruption about 2,350 years ago. The strange thing about the eruption was the fact it released the debris from the northeast side of the volcano, as rock and ash blocked a major river called the Lillooet River . The river was dammed to a height of at least 100 meters, forming a lake . The lake reached a maximum elevation of 810 meters and was at least 50 meters deep. The breccia soon eroded from water activity within the lake, forming Keyhole Falls. There was a massive flood when the water first broke through the breccia, carrying small house sized blocks of breccia. During this eruption, ash was hurled into the air over 20 kilometers above sea level. The ash was carried eastward as far as Alberta .  Volcanic hazards  Meager is an unstable volcano. It is built of unstable volcanic and has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Perberton Valley at least three times during the last 7,300 years. Two earlier debris flows, around 4,450 and 7,300 years ago, sent rubble at least 32 kilometers from the volcano. Recently, the volcano has created smaller landslides about every ten years, including one in 1975 that killed four geologists near Meager Creek. Logging, mining, tourism and wilderness recreation on nearby slopes and valleys are vulnerable to the volcano’s excellent geomorphic activity. The possibility of Mount Meager covering settled parts of the Pemberton Valley in a debris flow is estimated at about one in 2400 years. There is no sign of volcanic eruptions with these events, however scientists warn the volcano could release another massive debris flow over populated areas anytime without warning.  The explosive nature of past eruptions at Mount Meager indicates that this volcano also poses a considerable long-distance treat to communities across southern British Columbia and Alberta. It is also a local treat to the town of Pemberton, British Columbia, about 50\xa0km away. Another explosive eruption at Mount Meager would also have a considerable impact on local mining and logging operations, as well as significant negative impacts on the Lillooet River fishery.

This Tertiary to Holocene complex has erupted rocks of mafic to felsic composition from at least 8 vents.  The most recent eruption produced a pyroclastic flow and lava flow from a NE flank vent about 2350 years ago.  This view from the Lillooet River valley to the west shows, from left to right, the glacially dissected volcanic necks of Mount Capricorn, Meager Mountain, and Plinth Mountain.

They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They\'ve threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn\'t a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like "real" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.

Last update: 7 February 2016  Google+175  History and origin  About a 35% of the world population drives on the left , and the countries that do are mostly old British colonies. This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world, but there is a perfectly good reason. Click here for a world map and a full list of all countries of the world and the side of the road on which they drive.  Right-handed knights preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent  In the past, almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.  Furthermore, a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse, and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword (which would be worn on the left). It is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road, rather than in the middle of traffic, so if one mounts on the left, then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road.  In the late 1700s, however, teamsters in France and the United States began hauling farm products in big wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. These wagons had no driver’s seat; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse, so he could keep his right arm free to lash the team. Since he was sitting on the left, he naturally wanted everybody to pass on the left so he could look down and make sure he kept clear of the oncoming wagon’s wheels. Therefore he kept to the right side of the road.  In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth (Elizaveta Petrovna) officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right.\xa0In addition, the French Revolution of 1789 gave a huge impetus to right-hand travel in Europe. The fact is, before the Revolution, the aristocracy travelled on the left of the road, forcing the peasantry over to the right, but after the storming of the Bastille and the subsequent events, aristocrats preferred to keep a low profile and joined the peasants on the right. An official keep-right rule was introduced in Paris in 1794, more or less parallel to Denmark, where driving on the right had been made compulsory in 1793.  French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1812)  Later, Napoleon’s conquests spread the new rightism to the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), Switzerland, Germany, Poland and many parts of Spain and Italy. The states that had resisted Napoleon kept left – Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Portugal. This European division, between the left- and right-hand nations would remain fixed for more than 100 years, until after the First World War.  Although left-driving Sweden ceded Finland to right-driving Russia after the Finnish War (1808-1809), Swedish law – including traffic regulations – remained valid in Finland for another 50 years. It wasn’t until 1858 that an Imperial Russian decree made Finland swap sides.  The trend among nations over the years has been toward driving on the right, but Britain has done its best to stave off global homogenisation. With the expansion of travel and road building in the 1800s, traffic regulations were made in every country. Left-hand driving was made mandatory in Britain in 1835.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

This film adaptation was directed by David Fincher and written by Steven Zaillian. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.  Blomkvist breaks into Martin\'s house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England.

The deaths of Billie Holiday, Lester Young, and Sidney Bechet, key artists of the music\'s earlier periods, intensified the pervasive sense that a new era was beginning. In New York, then as now the center of the jazz universe, major developments would set the musical agendas of jazz practitioners for decades to come. Charles Mingus recorded two masterworks, Blues & Roots and Mingus Ah Um, both revealing a novel way for large ensembles to perform complex music without the aid of written-out parts; John Coltrane, with Giant Steps, took vertical, change-running improvisation, an approach traceable all the way back to the first important jazz saxophonist, Coleman Hawkins, to its outer limits and logical conclusion; Miles Davis meanwhile, in the nick of time, nudged Trane toward a new pursuit with Kind of Blue, the modal jazz shot heard \'round the world and perhaps the best-known jazz recording of all time.  These developments alone would grant 1959 the status of an important, ground-breaking year in jazz. However, one event, a portent really, crowded out all others of that crowded year, insuring that the future of jazz really could be read in the tea leaves of 1959. In November, an outfit led by a weird Texas misfit made its New York debut at the Five Spot Cafe, consummating a year when the seeds of much of jazz\'s future were planted. The Ornette Coleman Quartet started a two week engagement (it was later extended to two and a half months), and the music was never the same again.  Coleman and his bandmates treated the harmonic aspect of jazz improvisation in a new way, disavowing the standard practice of running a tune\'s changes and following conventional song forms, in favor of a new approach where unfettered melodic inventiveness was the guiding force. As Coleman put it to writer Martin Williams: "If I\'m going to follow a preset chord sequence, I may as well write out my solo." In finding a way to chart this unfamiliar territory, Coleman took his place among jazz\'s most important innovators, alongside such stellar "establishment" figures as Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker.  Coleman, however, was not immediately given the key to the city. Thanks to the formidable press hype preceding his New York arrival, the jazz community there was quickly induced to take sides. Much of the criticism was downright personal, like Miles Davis\'s reaction: "Hell, just listen to what he writes and how he plays. If you\'re talking psychologically, the man\'s all screwed up inside." Years later, Ornette told record producer/writer John Snyder that one night during the Five Spot gig, Max Roach punched him in the mouth, then showed up at 4 o\'clock the next morning in front of his apartment building, hollering "I know you\'re up there, motherfucker! Come down here and I\'ll kick your ass!"  Not that rejection was a new experience for Ornette Coleman. The first chapters of John Litweiler\'s new biography, Ornette Coleman: A Harmolodic Life, read nearly like a catalog of abuse: Ornette as a teenager in Fort Worth, being held up by his church bandleader as an example of how not to play ("he\'ll never be a saxophone player"); Ornette being fired on the spot from various gigs for solo breaks that stopped dancers in their tracks -- not with admiration, but with anger and alarm; Ornette, touring with a blues band, meeting local musicians who take him outside, beat him bloody and unconscious, and trash his horn; Ornette, sitting in with Dexter Gordon\'s rhythm section in L.A., being ordered by Dex to scram.  Litweiler faced no easy task in pinning down the real story of this enigmatic trailblazer. Take Ornette\'s early years: he was born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1930, according to most references, or 1931, according to his sister Truvenza | Question: Ornette Coleman, Louis Armstrong and Charles Mingus are associated with what style of music?', ['jazz'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3384')]

But I  have to admit that, as a young teenager, I had something of a crush on  Little Joe!  Who could resist his character with that handsome smile and  beautiful pinto horse?  Little Joe and his paint horse were definitely  the flashiest combo of the Cartwright clan!  To help put you back in a "Bonanza" mood, click on the  center button in the video box below to hear that great theme and see  some good pictures of the whole clan!  Background of the Show  The Bonanza tv show was set in the time during and  after the Civil War, and was all about the Cartwright family which  included the father, Ben, and his 3 sons Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe.  Did you ever wonder why those 3 brothers  didn\'t look anything alike?  That\'s right!   Each one had a different  mother and none of those women had survived!  Wow; Ben had his share of  bad luck in that department!  Not wanting to mess up a successful  formula, the show stayed consistent with that theme - any love interest  that developed for a Cartwright man didn\'t last any longer than a cold  drink on a hot day!  Here\'s a little bit about the Bonanza cast -  Ben (played by Lorne Greene) was the owner  of the very large (1,000 square miles) and very prosperous Ponderosa  Ranch, which was situated around Lake Tahoe in Nevada.  Adam (played be Pernell Roberts) was the  oldest son.  He was an architect and built that great ranch house where  the Cartwrights lived.  Adam was handsome and always dressed in black -  quiet, serious, the strong, silent type!  Next was Eric (played by Dan Blocker), but  we all knew him as Hoss, who obviously got that nickname because of his  size.  He was a big guy who looked even bigger in his trademark  10-gallon hat.  Hoss was gentle, sometimes naive, and not the brightest  member of the clan!  And then there was Little Joe (my personal  favorite - played by Michael Landon) who was the youngest.  He was  hot-headed and, with his good looks and flashy smile, quite the ladies  man!  DID YOU KNOW?  Bonanza came close to being  cancelled at the end of its first year!  But the fact that it was  considered a "novelty" because it was shown in color made all the  difference! RCA, the parent company of NBC, wanted to sell more color  television sets so they used Bonanza as a marketing gimmick and moved it  to a prime Sunday night timeslot believing it would attract more  viewers there!  Obviously they were right; Bonanza was in the Top 5  shows for 9 of its 14 years on TV.  All About the Show  Unlike the usual shoot\'em-up, Bonanza  was the first “dramatic” TV Western show.  The episodes were much more  about relationships between the cast members and the guest stars than  they were about hunting down the bad guy.  Each episode usually had a  serious theme to it, something "issue-oriented", built around themes  such as racism, prejudice and social injustice.  This was a first for TV  because the networks were afraid of letters they might receive.  Another first for Bonanza - it was the first Western to be televised in color.  Each show mixed the adventures of one or  two of the Cartwrights, their ranching and mining business, and an  assortment of characters who crossed their paths in some way.  The 4 main actors were considered equal  stars but, in case you didn\'t notice, the credits were rotated each week  so that top billing was | Question: Who was the actor who played Ben the head of the Cartwright family in Bonanza ?', ['lorne greene'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6956'), ("Context: Madagascar ( / ˌmædəˈɡæskər / ; Malagasy : Madagasikara ) , officially the Republic of Madagascar ( Malagasy : Repoblikan'i Madagasikara ( republiˈkjan madaɡasˈkjarə̥ ) ; French : République de Madagascar ) , and previously known as the Malagasy Republic , is an island country in the Indian Ocean , off the coast of East Africa .

On the far side of the Rock is the New Town of Fontvieille, where a number of F1 old and New drivers live.  The Circuit:  Monaco is unique, and to many the annual blast round the streets of the tiny principality represents the jewel in the crown of Formula One. With its legendary casino and countless rows of millionaires' yachts in the harbour, Monaco is a glamorous place that lies at the very heart of the jet-set. It is also unique in that for many of the drivers the race is run on their doorstep, with the same streets they use for a daily trip to the newsagents, transformed into a race track.  Winding through the streets it is a circuit that has remained remarkably unchanged since the first race was staged in 1929. Before the war the circuit was witness to several great battles, with the legendary Tazio Nuvolari often among the winners. When World Championship racing began in 1950 Monaco played host to the second race, just a week after the first round at Silverstone. That race resulted in a massive pile-up on the very first lap and provided Fangio with his first ever championship victory. Since then the race has been plagued by a high attrition rate that has thrown up some unusual victories over the years. The combination of narrow roads, high kerbs and the close proximity of some unforgiving crash barriers, many a great driver has suffered at the hands of a track that quickly punishes the slightest error in judgement.  One memorable race came in 1955, the year that is best remembered for Alberto Ascari's trip into the harbour, a feat that was later emulated by the Australian driver Paul Hawkins. Both men survived their dunking although a number of driver's have not been so lucky. Luigi Fagioli was killed in a sports car race here in 1952 and Lorenzo Bandini was burned to death in 1967. Other driver's have far happier memories of the place. Graham Hill, for years known as 'Mister Monaco', won here five times. A record he held until the arrival of Ayrton Senna.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)

The novel proved to critics that “Du Maurier is in a class by herself” (New York Times); her “masterful treatment” of her tale“made Rebecca a classic book” (Steinbrunner & Penzler, 136). “‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.’ The opening line of perhaps the greatest romantic suspense novel ever written has become as familiar to readers as ‘Call me Ishmael’ from Moby-Dick” (Penzler, Crown, 26).

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures. Star exhibits include two views of the River Thames by Canaletto and Haymaking by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  Another of the city’s new attractions is totally different.

It is characterized by large holes throughout the cheese and a texture that is somewhat hard. The flavor is rich and slightly sweet. The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

Reuters/Jim Young +  By Martyn Herman | WHISTLER  WHISTLER Amy Williams roared to Britain\'s first Olympic gold medal in an individual winter event since 1980 in the women\'s skeleton on Friday but had an anxious wait before Canada had an appeal against her helmet rejected.  The Canadians, whose own gold medal hope Mellisa Hollingsworth finished a tearful fifth, followed an earlier failed U.S. appeal against Williams\'s helmet which they said had illegal aerodynamic features.  Maybe the hosts were just bamboozled by the speed of Williams who had never won a World Cup race despite a silver medal the 2009 world championships.  The ice cool Queen of Speed smashed the women\'s course record on Thursday to hold the midway lead and went even faster in heat three with a new record of 53.68 to widen the gap to the chasing pack led by favorite Hollingsworth.  With a healthy 0.52-second cushion going into her fourth and final slide, Williams kept it clean through the 16 unforgiving curves to match the feat of Briton Robin Cousins who won the men\'s figure skating title in Lake Placid 30 years ago.  SPORTING HEROINE  "It\'s amazing, I feel like I\'m in a little bubble and not sure if it\'s real or not," the curly-haired Williams told Reuters as fans, some dressed as St George, waved Union Jacks in the grandstand and toasted their new sporting heroine.  "I knew I had to just keep it together. I can\'t remember what I did on the last run, half of the track is just a blur."  Hollingsworth\'s gold medal dream ended in despair when she crunched into a wall in the middle of her final run meaning Germany\'s Kerstin Szymkowiak took the silver, 0.56 seconds behind Williams, and compatriot Anja Huber the bronze.  "It is just really hard," Hollingsworth, this season\'s World Cup winner, said, tears streaking her red cheeks.  "I feel like I have let my entire country down. It could have happened anywhere, at a World Cup ... but it happened at the Olympic Games."  Williams, on a sled she calls Arthur, was unstoppable in all four runs, leading from start to finish, to become Britain\'s first gold medalist in a sliding sport since Anthony Nash and Robin Dixon in the two-man bobsleigh in 1964.  Former rower Steve Redgrave, Britain\'s most decorated Olympian, greeted Williams after her final slide to glory.  "The first thing she said to me after was when does it sink in?," Redgrave, who won five Olympic owing golds, told reporters. "I said it never does.

Horace Rumpole (played by the late Leo McKern) is an untidy, ageing London barrister with one glass eye who defends in criminal cases. His clients rarely cut elegant figures. He is fond of red wine, poetry, and fair dealing, and is not looked on as a great success in life by his wife, Hilda (\'She Who Must Be Obeyed\'). Rumpole has had a few triumphs, and the Penge Bungalow murders are often on his mind... Rumpole shares Chambers at Number 3, Equity Court, with a mixed group of barrister colleagues, including Guthrie Featherstone (Peter Bowles) and Phyllida Trant (Patricia Hodge).

Scientists discover the ability to bring extinct animals back to life via a complex cloning process. To make a profit off this technology, the InGen company decides to build a theme park featuring living dinosaurs.  This in itself would not be such a bad idea, except the organizers rush to get it open, build it on a remote island, and have almost no security personnel, deciding to automate the whole thing with unreliable computers — even refusing to tell the software designer what the system is for.  Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong .  The 1990 book Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton , while the 1993 movie Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg . Both were insanely popular then and are considered modern classics now, and the film spawned three sequels.  While the second film shared the name of the second book The Lost World : Jurassic Park, it had a wildly different storyline, mostly due to characters that originally died in the first book coming back. Jurassic Park III came out several years later. While neither rose to the \'classic\' status of the first film, both were fairly well received. The same basic story exists in all of the films, only separated by what characters are involved and certain action scenes. A fourth cinematic installment was in Development Hell for nearly a decade - it was even considered that it would not come through after Michael Crichton\'s death in 2008. But it all worked out, and the fourth film, titled Jurassic World , was released in 2015. After a highly successful run at the box office, positive reviews, and a resurrection of the franchise in general, a fifth film is to be released on June 22, 2018.

The man who brought the Chipmunks to life, Ross Bagdasarian, was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California. He came to Los Angeles in 1950, and appeared in the films Viva Zapata, Stalag 17, and Rear Window. Bagdasarian also worked as a songwriter, reaching the charts first in 1956, as his production of Alfi & Harry\'s "The Trouble with Harry" hit number 44. He later charted two solo singles (recorded as David Seville), "Armen\'s Theme" and "Gotta Get to Your House." In 1958, Bagdasarian began experimenting with a novel technique -- recording normal vocals but then speeding up the playback on a tape machine. The process yielded the number one hit "Witch Doctor" in early 1958, and the phenomenon mushroomed later that year when his Christmas gimmick single "The Chipmunk Song" spent four weeks at the top of the charts. "Alvin\'s Harmonica" reached number three just two months later, and Christmas reissues of "The Chipmunk Song" charted in the Top 40 over the next four years. The Alvin Show premiered on prime-time television in 1961, with all voices supplied by Bagdasarian. It only ran for one year, but was a success in a Saturday-morning slot. Five more Chipmunks singles charted in the early \'60s, and five LPs also did well, including a Beatles cover album in 1964.  Although Bagdasarian died in 1972, his son Ross Jr. revived Alvin, Simon, and Theodore in 1979 on Saturday mornings and on the 1980 album Chipmunk Punk. The series became more popular than in the \'60s, and albums of the Chipmunks singing country, Christmas, rock, and Hollywood favorites were big sellers, though they didn\'t enjoy chart success. Although the cartoon was no longer in production by the \'90s, new Chipmunks records continued appearing, among them 1998\'s A-Files: Alien Files.  In 2007, a film series debuted with Alvin and the Chipmunks -- the first being so successful that it spawned three sequels: 2009\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, 2011\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, and 2015\'s Alvin and the Chipmunks 4. A revival of the TV series was also planned to premiere on Nickelodeon in early 2015. ~ John Bush, Rovi  Related Artists  Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDbAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007) - IMDb  IMDb  17 January 2017 4:34 PM, UTC  NEWS  There was an error trying to load your rating for this title.

The Pirates of Penzance – English National OperaThe Pirates of Penzance | Discover Opera | English National Opera  The Pirates of Penzance  Composer  Gilbert & Sullivan  Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera is packed full of sentimental\xa0pirates, blundering policeman, absurd adventures and improbable paradoxes.  Frederic, a pirate’s apprentice, falls head-over-heels in love with Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley. Frederic is due to be released from his apprenticeship on his 21st birthday, but there’s a snag. Born on 29\xa0February, Frederic discovers that he is technically still a youngster. Although very much in love, his dedication to duty is unshakeable. Can he find a way to live happily-ever-after with Mabel?  Synopsis  Act I  A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall  The pirates offer a toast to Frederic who is celebrating his 21st birthday and the end of his apprenticeship. Ruth, a maid who also works with the pirates, explains that when Frederic was younger she was instructed by his father to have the small boy apprenticed to a pilot, but she misheard and instead took Frederic to a pirate.  Now that his obligation to the pirates has ended, duty compels Frederic to devote himself to destroying them. When the men admit their inability to make piracy pay, Frederic explains that they are themselves slaves to their tender hearts, particularly regarding their refusal to take advantage of anyone they believe to be an orphan. Frederic wishes he could bring the pirates back to a respectable life, but the Pirate King rejects that possibility.  Ruth longs for Frederic to take her with him when he leaves. He admits that he is reluctant to marry her, though he is satisfied that, despite her age, she is beautiful. But when he sees a group of lovely young women approaching, he rages at her for deceiving him.  The young women are astonished to encounter Frederic and horrified to hear that he is a pirate. He assures them that he only wants to love one of them. They all reject him except Mabel.  The pirates surprise the girls and anticipate soon becoming their husbands. Their father, the Major General, enters and objects to the girls being married against their wills to pirates. He lies his way out of the situation by claiming to be an orphan. The girls are released from the pirates’ clutches, as Mabel and Frederic – ignoring the pleas of Ruth – look forward to their marriage.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology. Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) . What Arnott called proof through the “hard school of practical production” suggests an axiom that doing it by-hand is a kind of Occam’s razor for purifying and endorsing historical conjecture as common- | Question: To prove his theories of the diaspora of South American peoples, who sailed in a balsa raft called Kon Tiki across the Pacific Ocean in 1947?', ['ra ii', 'thor heyerdahl'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3515')]

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs. Most cleaning attempts merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Is She a “Lady” or a “Woman”?  By Maeve Maddox  A reader wonders about the words lady and woman:  I was attempting to explain, \xa0to\xa0my walking group, the difference between\xa0“woman” and “lady”. I gave examples, through parallel terms the equality between male and female, woman and man, lady and gentleman.\xa0 I said, “We are all\xa0women, but not all of us are ladies. When asked if ‘lady’ was a ‘better’ woman, I was stuck because, I don’t feel that’s is the case, but\xa0I think\xa0our culture thinks so.\xa0 Any help?\xa0  This question is one with all kinds of ramifications.  I belong to a generation for whom gendered words used to be fairly clear-cut:  woman: generic word for a female human being  man: generic word for a male human being  lady: a woman of refined behavior and speech  gentleman: a man of refined behavior and speech  According to these simple definitions, a lady is a woman, but not all women are ladies. Ditto with the words man and gentleman.  Since the gender revolution, some women are insulted to be called “ladies,” feeling that the word suggests inferiority, hypocrisy, or condescension. Children, on the other hand, seem to be taught to call all women ladies, and Hollywood celebrities habitually use the word “lady” to mean “girlfriend” or “wife.”  The questioner’s pairing of lady and gentleman makes sense to me, but I think the word gentleman has pretty much lost its meaning for most people. For example, policemen, lawyers, and newscasters often refer to men in criminal custody as “gentlemen.” I find this usage especially irritating .  I think of lady as a special word for a classy woman, one who dresses appropriately for different occasions and speaks and acts with unfailing courtesy to  everyone she encounters. I wouldn’t say that a lady is “better” than a woman.  I’d just say that certain things set a “lady” apart from your generic “woman.” To draw from the celebrity sphere, I might associate the word “lady” with Oprah or Meryl Streep, but probably not with Rosanne Barr or Britney Spears.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, lady and woman still had connotations of social class. A NY Times article dated 1887 tells how a “gentleman” knocked down a cabman because he’d insulted the man’s wife by referring to her as a “woman.” In many novels, servants are careful to distinguish between “ladies and gentlemen,” and “persons” of lower rank. As late as 1966 Agatha Christie describes this exchange between Hercule Poirot and his manservant George:  Poirot considered this reply. He remembered the slight pause that George had made before the phrase–young lady. George was a delicate social recorder. He had been uncertain of the visitor’s status but had given her the benefit of the doubt.  “You are of the opinion that she is a young lady rather than, let us say, a young person?”  “I think so, sir, though it is not always easy to tell nowadays.” George spoke with genuine regret. —Third Girl  I suppose that in our “nowadays,” any significant difference between  the words lady and woman has disappeared for most speakers.

Discovering the Biblical Moses  Read Peter Machinist’s article “The Man Moses” as it originally appeared in Bible Review, April 2000. The article was first republished in Bible History Daily in 2012.—Ed.  \xa0  The Exodus hero Moses. The Biblical Moses, portrayed here as a shepherd in a print by contemporary Israeli artist Mordechai Beck, protectively clasps a sheep in his arms. Photo: Mordechai Beck.  Moses’ story is told in the Book of Exodus , but it starts in Genesis with the story of Abraham and his family with whom God makes a covenant. Generations later the Biblical Moses draws the extended family together in the form of a nation with a structure and code of law, given to him on Mount Sinai . Below, Peter Machinist explores the story of Moses, the Exodus hero, in “The Man Moses.”  Some might say that God himself was the Exodus hero, but in human terms the Biblical Moses takes center stage throughout the whole Pentateuch. Who was Moses? A rather solitary leader, one with his people but set apart, even in his childhood, when he was raised by the pharaoh’s daughter as if he were an Egyptian prince. Set apart also in that he married an alien wife—Midianite or possibly Ethiopian. Even his physical characteristics—a speech defect—set him apart from others and is accommodated by God who arranges a leadership duo with Moses and his priestly brother Aaron . His role was unique—even to receiving the Law and seeing God, as evidenced by Moses’ blinding countenance.  The Biblical Moses also has an unusual death. God says he must die alone on a mountaintop outside the promised land. Who was Moses? We might say he was a man who was a son of Abraham who led the people but was not typical of them.  In “The Man Moses,” Peter Machinist proposes that our Exodus hero is a type of anti-hero, outside the stereotype of a tribal or national leader. He might represent the people of Israel themselves, Biblically portrayed as being outsiders. Further, Moses’ otherness might also serve to turn the spotlight not on himself but on the message he delivers to the people: the Law. Who was Moses—the Biblical Moses? Who was the man chosen to meet God on Sinai and receive the Law on behalf of God’s chosen people?  Below, Peter Machinist explores the character of the Exodus hero—the Biblical Moses—in “The Man Moses.”  \xa0  The Man Moses  by Peter Machinist  “You shall not cross there,” God decrees as Moses gazes across the Jordan. In this 1928 pastel by Lesser Ury, heavenly light illuminates the promised land that Moses has sought almost all his life but will never enter. Rather, Moses dies on Mt. Nebo—a strange and solitary death for a strangely solitary man. The biblical portrayal of Moses as distant and unapproachable, as the only biblical leader to see God “face to face” (Deuteronomy 34:10), presents Moses as representative of the Israelites—a people apart. At the same time, it encourages readers to concentrate more on the law he gave than on the life he lived. Photo: Hans-Joachim Bartsch/Collection Jüdisches Museum Berlin.

Uranus is larger in diameter but smaller in mass than Neptune  Planet Profile  orbit : 2,870,990,000 km (19.218 AU ) from Su  diameter : 51,118 km (equatorial)  Careful pronunciation may be necessary        to avoid embarrassment; say "YOOR\xa0a\xa0nus"\xa0  , not  "your anus" or "urine us".  Uranus is the ancient Greek deity of the Heavens, the earliest supreme god. Uranus was the son and mate of Gaia the father of Cronus (Saturn) and of the Cyclopes and Titans (predecessors of the Olympian gods).  Uranus, the first planet discovered in modern times, was discovered by William Herschel while systematically searching        the sky with his telescope on March 13, 1781.        It had actually been seen many times before but ignored as simply another star        (the earliest recorded sighting was in 1690 when John Flamsteed       cataloged it as 34 Tauri).        Herschel named it "the\xa0Georgium\xa0Sidus"        (the Georgian Planet) in honor of his patron,        the infamous (to Americans) King George III of England; others called it        "Herschel".  The name "Uranus" was        first proposed by Bode in conformity with the        other planetary names from classical mythology but didn\'t come into        common use until 1850.  Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 on Jan 24 1986.  Most of the planets spin on an axis nearly perpendicular to the plane of        the ecliptic but Uranus\' axis is almost        parallel to the ecliptic.        At the time of Voyager 2\'s passage,        Uranus\' south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun.        This results in the odd fact that Uranus\' polar regions receive more energy        input from the Sun than do its equatorial regions.        Uranus is nevertheless hotter at its equator than at its poles. The mechanism        underlying this is unknown.  Actually, there\'s an ongoing battle over which of Uranus\'        poles is its north pole!  Either its axial inclination is a bit over 90        degrees and its rotation is direct ,        or it\'s a bit less than 90 degrees and the rotation is retrograde .        The problem is that you need to draw a dividing line *somewhere*, because        in a case like Venus there is little dispute        that the rotation is indeed        retrograde (not a direct rotation with an inclination of nearly 180).  Uranus is composed primarily of rock and various ices ,        with only about 15% hydrogen and a little helium (in contrast to Jupiter and Saturn which are mostly hydrogen).        Uranus (and Neptune) are in many ways similar to the cores of Jupiter and        Saturn minus the massive liquid metallic hydrogen envelope.        It appears that Uranus does not have a rocky core like Jupiter and Saturn        but rather that its material is more or less uniformly distributed.  Uranus\' atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane.  Like the other gas planets, Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around  rapidly.  But they are extremely faint, visible only with radical image        enhancement of the Voyager 2 pictures        (right).        Recent observations with HST (left) show larger and        more pronounced streaks.        Further HST observations show even more activity.   Uranus is no longer the bland boring planet that Voyager saw! It now seems clear that the differences are due to        seasonal effects since the Sun is now at a  lower Uranian latitude which may        cause more pronounced day/night weather effects.   By 2007 the Sun will be directly over Uranus\'s equator.  Uranus\' blue color is the result of absorption of red light by methane in the        upper atmosphere.

Reuters/Jim Young +  By Martyn Herman | WHISTLER  WHISTLER Amy Williams roared to Britain\'s first Olympic gold medal in an individual winter event since 1980 in the women\'s skeleton on Friday but had an anxious wait before Canada had an appeal against her helmet rejected.  The Canadians, whose own gold medal hope Mellisa Hollingsworth finished a tearful fifth, followed an earlier failed U.S. appeal against Williams\'s helmet which they said had illegal aerodynamic features.  Maybe the hosts were just bamboozled by the speed of Williams who had never won a World Cup race despite a silver medal the 2009 world championships.  The ice cool Queen of Speed smashed the women\'s course record on Thursday to hold the midway lead and went even faster in heat three with a new record of 53.68 to widen the gap to the chasing pack led by favorite Hollingsworth.  With a healthy 0.52-second cushion going into her fourth and final slide, Williams kept it clean through the 16 unforgiving curves to match the feat of Briton Robin Cousins who won the men\'s figure skating title in Lake Placid 30 years ago.  SPORTING HEROINE  "It\'s amazing, I feel like I\'m in a little bubble and not sure if it\'s real or not," the curly-haired Williams told Reuters as fans, some dressed as St George, waved Union Jacks in the grandstand and toasted their new sporting heroine.  "I knew I had to just keep it together. I can\'t remember what I did on the last run, half of the track is just a blur."  Hollingsworth\'s gold medal dream ended in despair when she crunched into a wall in the middle of her final run meaning Germany\'s Kerstin Szymkowiak took the silver, 0.56 seconds behind Williams, and compatriot Anja Huber the bronze.  "It is just really hard," Hollingsworth, this season\'s World Cup winner, said, tears streaking her red cheeks.  "I feel like I have let my entire country down. It could have happened anywhere, at a World Cup ... but it happened at the Olympic Games."  Williams, on a sled she calls Arthur, was unstoppable in all four runs, leading from start to finish, to become Britain\'s first gold medalist in a sliding sport since Anthony Nash and Robin Dixon in the two-man bobsleigh in 1964.  Former rower Steve Redgrave, Britain\'s most decorated Olympian, greeted Williams after her final slide to glory.

Earlier Alex Partridge and hockey player Hannah Macleod had appealed for the return of their stolen Olympic bronze medals from London 2012.  Partridge said he was devastated when he realised his blazer, which had the medal in an inside pocket, had gone.  The 31-year-old told BBC Sport: “It’s very, very upsetting. It would mean everything to me to get them back.”  Partridge, whose bronze in the men’s eight followed a silver medal at the Beijing Games in 2008, added: “I worked for 12 years of my life to try to achieve something at the Olympic Games and that’s what I’ve got to show for it.  “While we were out and dancing away, I noticed I’d misplaced my blazer. In the morning, I thought one of the other Olympians must have picked it up by accident, but no-one had it.  “I always say to people ‘it’s not about the medal, it’s about the journey’, but I guess you don’t appreciate the value of it until it’s not there.  “It was only when I picked up my 16-month-old daughter from nursery that it really dawned on me. If it doesn’t come back she won’t see everything I worked for, which was a representation of being in the best British Olympic team and possibly the best Olympics ever.”  Macleod, who won her London 2012 bronze medal with the women’s hockey team, believes the theft was pre-meditated after viewing CCTV footage.  “It looked like a very well done job,” Macleod told BBC Radio 5 live.  “The CCTV footage shows a couple who were acting suspiciously and had done a couple of laps of the bar, scoping things out prior to approaching our group.”  \xa0  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news ...Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post | UK news | The Guardian  Stolen Olympic bronze medal is returned in post  Hannah Macleod's medal, taken from London nightclub while athletes partied, posted anonymously to England Hockey  London 2012 Olympic medalist Hannah MacLeod, whose bronze medal for hockey has been returned.

Entomologists study insects and their relationship to humans, other organisms, and the environment. The study of insects creates the building blocks for developments in chemical and biological pest control, food production, biological diversity, and a variety of other fields in science. They may specialize in agriculture, ecology, physiology, or insecticide toxicology. An entomologist studies the classification, life cycle, and habits of insects. They will often work with other scientists on joint projects such as creating pest resistant crops. They could also work with parasitologists or other microbiologists to develop new vaccines and medicines that combat insects that spread diseases. They investigate ways to control insect pests, parasites, predators, and pollinators.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes.

But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon.

"Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes.

But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight.

A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

In the film, she was portrayed by Jane Seymour .  Contents  Film biography  Bond meets Solitaire.  Solitaire is a psychic in the employ of Dr. Kananga . As James Bond travels to New York by plane, Solitaire describes his journey to Dr. Kananga through the use of Tarot cards. The one drawback to her ability is that she must remain a virgin in order to preserve it.  After Bond follows Kananga to the Fillet of Soul restaurant, he meets Solitaire. After a rather brief encounter with Mr. Big, Bond asks Solitaire about his future. When instructed to pick up a card Bond quizzically comments "us?” after picking up the lovers card.  When Bond and Rosie Carver visit San Monique, Solitaire tells Kananga the future, once more picking the lovers card in regard to Bond. Later that evening Bond returns to the island. After convincing Solitaire they are meant to be lovers, with odds stacked in his favor, Bond succeeds in seducing her. After losing her virginity to Bond through their sexual intercourse, Solitaire loses her psychic power, which endangers her life. Bond discovers Kananga is hiding vast areas of poppy fields. Bond and Solitaire evade Kananga\'s men, escaping in Quarrel Jr. \'s boat.  Bond seduces Solitaire.  After arriving in New Orleans , Bond and Solitaire are captured and taken to Mr Big. Before Bond can be given his skydiving lesson without a parachute, he manages to escape. Solitaire is recaptured by Kananga\'s henchmen and taken back to him.  While interrogating Bond at the Fillet of Soul, Kananga demands to know whether he has slept with Solitaire. When 007 refuses to answer, Kananga decides to find out for himself by putting Solitaire\'s psychic powers to the test. Taking Bond\'s watch, he reads out what he claims to be its registration number and asks Solitaire to confirm whether he is telling the truth. After some hesitation, she replies, "You speak the truth", prompting a seemingly satisfied Kananga to release Bond. Initially relieved at her narrow escape, she soon learns that she has, in fact, answered incorrectly. When Kananga asks why she allowed herself to be seduced by Bond, Solitaire protests that the cards had spoken and she had no choice in the matter. Unmoved, he slaps her to the floor, sentences her to death and turns her over to Baron Samedi .  Kananga demands to know why Solitaire betrayed him.  After a raid on the Fillet of Soul, Felix Leiter informs Bond that Kananga has taken Solitaire back to San Monique , leaving behind three Tarot cards: the High Priestess, the Moon and Death. Arriving on San Monique, where a voodoo ceremony is already under way, Bond looks on as Solitaire is led out for sacrifice. Tied to an altar, she watches helplessly as a gleeful Dambala menaces her with the same snake that killed the unfortunate Baines. However, just before it can inflict the fatal bite, Bond interrupts the ceremony, shoots Dambala dead and rescues Solitaire. While attempting to escape, Bond and Solitaire make their way through an underground passageway, which ultimately leads them to Kananga and Whisper .

Question: What Is the Most Abundant Gas in the Earth\'s Atmosphere?  The Earth\'s atmosphere or air is composed of several gases. One gas is much more abundant than any other. Can you guess which one it is?  Answer:\xa0By far, the most abundant gas in the Earth\'s atmosphere is nitrogen , which accounts for about 78% of the mass of dry air. Oxygen is the next most abundant gas, present at levels of 20-21%. Although humid air seems like it contains a lot of water, the maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is only about 4%.  Abundance of Gases in the Atmosphere  This table lists the eleven most abundant gases in the lower portion of Earth\'s atmosphere (up to 25 km). While the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen are fairly stable, the amount of greenhouse gases changes and depends on location. Water vapor is extremely variable. In arid or extremely cold regions, water vapor may be nearly absent. In warm, tropical regions, water vapor accounts for a significant portion of atmospheric gases.  continue reading below our video  Test Your General Science Knowledge  Some references include other gases on this list, such as krypton (less abundant than helium, but more than hydrogen), xenon (less abundant than hydrogen), nitrogen dioxide (less abundant than ozone), and iodine (less abundant than ozone).  Gas  * gases with variable composition  Reference:\xa0Pidwirny, M. (2006). "Atmospheric Composition".\xa0Fundamentals of Physical Geography, 2nd Edition.  The average concentration of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxde, methane, and nitrous dioxide has been increasing. Ozone is concentrated around cities and in the Earth\'s stratosphere. In addition to the elements in the table and krypton, xenon, nitrogen dioxide, and iodine (all mentioned earlier), there are trace amounts of ammonia, carbon monoxide, and several other gases.  Why Is Important To Know the Abundance of Gases?  It\'s important to know which gas is most abundant, what the other gases are in the Earth\'s atmosphere, and how the composition of air changes with altitude and over time for multiple reasons. The information helps us understand and predict the weather. The amount of water vapor in air is particularly relevant to weather forecasting. The gas composition helps us understand the effects of natural and manmade chemicals released into the atmosphere. The make-up of the atmosphere is extremely important for climate, so changes in gases may help us predict broad climate change.

It is essential to all life and serves several purposes, such as providing air for respiration, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting the earth from falling meteorites, controlling climate and regulating the water cycle. The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of approximately 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 1 percent argon and trace amounts of other gases that include carbon dioxide and neon.  Nitrogen  Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images  Nitrogen is a colorless, unscented and inert (does not react with other chemicals) gas. Chemist Daniel Rutherford first discovered this chemical element in 1772. Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere and is found in all living organisms. Nitrogen is an important component of amino acids, protein, DNA and RNA. All living organisms depend on nitrogen for growth, metabolic processes and reproduction.

They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They\'ve threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn\'t a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like "real" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.

Byker Grove was the original idea of late TV executive Andrea Wonfor. In 1987, Andrea approached veteran soap writer Adele Rose. Together they created a single pilot episode featuring kids aged 8–11 at an out-of-school club (transmitted on Tyne Tees TV in 1988). In autumn 1988, Andrea got backing from Anna Home, then Head of drama, BBC TV. Anna gave the green light for a run of a series of six 25-minute episodes on BBC TV. The age of the main characters was raised to 12-16 after support from first producer-director, Matthew Robinson . The first series therefore centred on young teenagers crossing the bridge from childhood to adulthood. Although some of the action took place outside the youth club, the series was unusual among dramas in that the characters were rarely shown in school. One of the major settings was the foster home run by the kindly but strict Lou Gallagher, the longest-running character.  \xa0 Famous people  Byker Grove launched the careers of Anthony McPartlin ("P.J.") and Declan Donnelly ("Duncan") who are otherwise known as Ant & Dec as well as the actress Jill Halfpenny , Donna Air , former CBBC presenter Andrew Hayden-Smith and Emmerdale actors Dale Meeks , Charlie Hardwick and Victoria Hawkins . Also appearing in the series was the now glamour model Francoise Boufhal ("Ellie Baines"). Founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson who, after Byker Grove, became executive producer of EastEnders , Head of Drama BBC Wales and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia . It was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen Mamma Mia , the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham ( This Life , Doctor Who and co-creator of BBC One\'s Life on Mars ). The first writer was Adele Rose - in Series 1 she wrote eps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, her daughter, Carrie Rose, writing ep 5 - and the most prolific was Brian B. Thompson , who wrote 50 episodes over 12 series. Tom Hooper directed four episodes of the show in 1997. [1] Charlie Hunnam now stars in American TV series Sons of Anarchy .  \xa0 Production  \xa0 The Mitre , also known as Benwell Towers, acted as the production offices and the fictional youth club.  Byker Grove was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle . The actual youth club set was in Benwell , which is in the west area of the City, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne & Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the famous architecture that is the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) are used for filming backdrops.  The "youth club" building which is what the viewers see onscreen, known as The Mitre used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 90s) before it was bought by Zenith Television , who film the series. The building housed the actual set, production offices, make up suite and costume department. Currently the property is semi-vacant, and the Zenith North Television signs have been removed outside the building.  The final series started on 7 October 2006 on the CBBC Channel. Richard Deverell , head of CBBC, was interviewed on Newsround about the decision to axe Byker Grove.

The 12 animals that appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar include a rat, buffalo (ox), tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. It’s an unusual combination of animals for sure, and their appearance on the Chinese Zodiac is the topic of countless legends and is deeply embedded in Chinese mythology.  An unlikely gathering  The most well-known of the Chinese zodiac legends states that Buddha invited the animals to participate in a race. The prize was a coveted position on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. The first 12 animals to cross the river would appear on the Chinese Zodiac calendar in the order in which they completed the race.  The first animal to make it across the finish line according to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology was the rat. It seems unlikely that such a small animal could win such a strenuous race, especially when one considers all the contenders.  Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology explains that the rat used his brain rather than his brawn. It hitched a ride on what it perceived was the mightiest swimmer. Just before the buffalo reached the shore, the rat jumped off the buffalo’s back and crossed the finish line before the buffalo, putting the rat in first place.  The buffalo came in second and as promised in the legends and mythology, was the second animal listed on the Chinese Zodiac. The tiger, also being strong, came in third, followed by the rabbit that jumped his way across and was helped during the last stretch by the dragon. A snake hid in the hoof of the horse which is how it managed to make it across the river. At the last minute the snake jumped out and scared the horse into seventh place.  The sheep, monkey and rooster helped one another across and earned their spots on the calendar as well. The dog made it too, but decided a bath was more important than the position which is why it came in eleventh. Finally, the pig appeared and is listed last. According to Chinese Zodiac legends and mythology, the pig feasted and rested half-way through the race, but made it across guaranteeing its position.  A small gathering  The history of the Chinese Zodiac weaves another intriguing tale. This one tells of an invitation to a grand feast. All the animals were invited to join Buddha at either a birthday celebration, a New Year celebration, or a celebration for his departure from this world. Only 12 animals showed up at the festivities and that’s how they ended up being featured on the Chinese Zodiac calendar. Another of the legends of the Chinese Zodiac states that instead of Buddha, it was the Jade Emperor who invited the animals.  Regardless of the specific version of Chinese Zodiac history to which you subscribe, the Chinese Zodiac has amazed and entertained people around the world for thousands of years.

The second way to experience Egypt is from the comfort of your own home: online.  Horus, the God of Kings in Ancient Egypt  Horus, the God of Kings  by Jimmy Dunn  From the very earliest of times, the falcon seems to have been worshipped in Egypt as representative of the greatest cosmic powers. Many falcon gods existed throughout Egypt, though over time, a good number of these assimilated to Horus , the most important of the avian deities. Yet, from all his of many forms, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the "true" Horus. Horus is mostly a general term for a great number of falcon deities.  Horus is one of ancient Egypt\'s best known gods , as well as one of its oldest. His name is attested to from at least the beginning of the Dynastic Period , and depictions of falcon deities on earlier artifacts, such as the Narmer Palette, probably represent this same god. The Turin Canon, which provides some of our most important information on Egypt\'s early history, specifically describes the Predynastic rulers of Egypt as "Followers of Horus".  The use of his name was also widespread in personal names throughout Egyptian history, and Hor, as a personal name, survives into our modern era in a number                   of different forms.  Forms of Horus  Horus is a complicated deity, appearing in many different forms and his mythology is one of the most extensive of all Egyptian deities. Indeed, he has so many different aspects that we must limit our discussion to those that are significant. At the same time, a judicious examination of the various Horuses and the sources relating to them supports the possibility that the roles in question are closely interrelated, and so they may be understood as different aspects of the same divine persona.  The original form of Horus was probably that of a sky god, known as "lord of the sky". The Egyptian word " her" (hor, har), from which the god\'s name is derived means "the one on high", or "the distant one", probably in reference to the soaring flight of the hunting falcon, if not a reference to the solar aspect of the god. Mythologically, the god was imagined as a celestial falcon, whose right eye was the sun and left eye the moon. The speckled feathers of his breast were probably considered to be the stars, while his wings were the sky that created the wind. In this form, Horus was apparently worshipped at some of Egypt\'s earliest shrines such as at Nekhen (Heirakonpolis) , where he was assimilated with a number of other local falcon gods. In this capacity, Horus was the patron of the Nekhen monarchy that grew into the historical pharaonic state and hence, the first known national god.  A natural outgrowth of his role as "lord of the sky" was his aspect as a sun god. An ivory comb of the 1st Dynasty king Den depicts a falcon in a boat riding on outstretched wings, suggesting the falcon traversing the sky as the sun god. The early Pyramid Texts specifically refer to him in solar terms as "god of the east", and he  appears in at least three forms in this guise.  As Horakhty (Harakhty), or "Horus of the two horizons", Horus was the god of the rising and setting sun, but more particularly the god of the east and the sunrise. In the Pyramid Texts , the deceased king is said to be reborn in the eastern sky as Horakhty. Eventually, Horakhty became a part of the Heliopolis sun cult and was fused with its solar god as Re-Horakhty .

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.  Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates\' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins.  Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.  Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.  In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.  History   Origins    The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball.   Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.  Consensus once held that today\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball."  It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.  The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.  David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player.   William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.  This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town\'s new meeting house.

Eliot, 1888-1965 - Binghamton UniversityEliot  A Descriptive            Chronology of His Plays,  Theatrical Career, and Dramatic Theories  Excerpted with            additions and other modifications from Charles A. Carpenter\'s Modern            British, Irish, and American Drama: A Descriptive Chronology, 1865-1965.            For an explanation of principles and limitations, click on Introduction above.  A selective            bibliography of books by and about the dramatist is appended.  1888  September  Thomas Stearns Eliot is born into a wealthy family on September 26 in St. Louis,    Missouri. His father, a successful businessman, and his mother, an activist    and frustrated poet, are both 45.  1915  Attending Oxford University, Eliot marries an Englishwoman and decides to make    England his home.  1920  May  In a review of a poetic drama by Middleton Murry, Eliot says that composing    such a drama in the present era "is in fact the most difficult, the most    exhausting task that a poet can set himself" (Athenaeum).  November  In “The Possibility of a Poetic Drama” (Dial), Eliot    speculates why the poetic drama of the time is marked by “incompetence.” He doubts that “any drama which ‘embodies a philosophy’ of    the author’s (like Faust) or which illustrates a social theory    (like Bernard Shaw’s) can possibly fulfil the requirements—though    a place might be left for Shaw if not for Goethe.”  1924  September  Arnold Bennett records in his diary that Eliot told him he "wanted to write    a drama of modern life (furnished flat sort of people) in a rhythmic prose \'perhaps    with certain things in it accentuated by drum-beats.\' "  1927  Eliot converts to the Anglican faith, a radical divergence from his Unitarian    upbringing.  November  Eliot becomes a naturalized English citizen. One consequence is that although    he will continue to be regarded as an American poet, when his career in poetic    drama begins he is consistently treated as a British dramatist.  1934  May  Eliot’s The Rock: A Pageant Play is staged at Sadler’s    Wells Theatre 13 times to audiences of over a thousand per night. He had accepted    a commission from the Anglican diocese of London to supply the text (with others)    for a theatrical spectacle which would benefit the Forty-Five Churches Fund.    The episodic scenario which he was given to work with traces the history of    the English church from ancient to modern times in a production requiring 22    scene changes, an orchestra and choir, and a cast of 300. Its distinction as    one of many such fund-raising events lies in the memorable poetic speeches he    wrote for the choral narrator / commentator (later printed in his collections    of poetry). Eliot responds to detractors that the play was a “revue and    an advertisement,” not a contribution to dramatic literature; "My    only serious dramatic aim was to show that there is a possible role for a chorus" (June Spectator).

On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994). After a break from writing, he returned in 2008 with a thriller entitled Second World.  Views on underage sex  In October 2012, he was charged with child sex offences allegedly committed in the 1990s. In December 2012, he denied six counts of rape involving a girl under 16.  The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.  In August 2013, he said that girls who throw themselves at celebrities or who "go out and just have a good time" could themselves be to blame. In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.  Shah\'s comments came directly after a prosecuting barrister was suspended following "inappropriate comments" concerning the rape of a 13-year-old.   Personal life  Shah is married to actress Jennifer White Shah, whom he first met while he was working for Granada Television. The company was producing The Caesars (1968) and Jennifer White  was an actress playing Caligula\'s sister in the series.

Early life  Born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, Yates  was brought up in a show business family. Her mother was Elaine Smith, a former showgirl, actress and writer of erotic novels, who used the stage name Heller Toren. Until late in her life, Yates believed her biological father to be Jess Yates, who hosted the ITV religious programme Stars on Sunday. Jess Yates and Elaine Smith were married from 1958 to 1975. Jess Yates was sixteen years older than his wife, and their marriage was unconventional.  In an unsettled childhood, Paula attended school at Rowen Primary School, Penrhos College, Ysgol Aberconwy. The Yates family ran the Deganwy Castle Hotel for a time, before moving to a large house in Rowen, Conwy. After the break-up of her parents\' marriage in 1975, Paula lived mostly with her mother, including periods in Malta and Mallorca where she was a pupil at Bellver International College, before returning to Britain.  Career  In 1979, Yates began her career as a music journalist with a column called "Natural Blonde" in the Record Mirror, shortly after posing for Penthouse magazine. She first came to prominence in the 1980s, as co-presenter (with Jools Holland) of the Channel 4 pop music programme The Tube. She also appeared alongside friend Jennifer Saunders in 1987 for a spoof \'mockumentary\' on Bananarama.  In 1982, she released a version of the Nancy Sinatra hit song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin\'".   After the birth of her daughters, Yates wrote two books on motherhood.  Yates continued with her rock journalism, in addition to being presenter of the cutting-edge music show The Tube. She became most notorious for her "on the bed" interviews on the show The Big Breakfast, produced by her husband, Bob Geldof.  On 27 October 1995, Yates appeared on the quiz programme Have I Got News for You and clashed with Ian Hislop over comments he had previously made about her breast enlargement surgery.  Yates referred to Hislop as "the sperm of the devil", to which Hislop replied, "Even your insults emanate from the genitals!"  Personal life  Yates met Geldof in the early days of the Boomtown Rats. They became a couple in 1976 when she flew to Paris to surprise him while the band was playing there. Their first daughter, Fifi Trixibelle, was born on 31 March 1983,  named Fifi after Bob\'s aunt Fifi and Trixibelle because Paula wanted a belle in the family.  After ten years together, they married on 31 August 1986 in Las Vegas, with Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran acting as Geldof\'s best man. The couple then had two more daughters, Peaches Geldof  on 13 March 1989, and Pixie Geldof on 17 September 1990.  Yates first met Michael Hutchence in a 1985 interview on Channel 4\'s rock magazine programme The Tube.  During this appearance on The Tube, Yates was reportedly asked to leave Hutchence alone by the road manager of INXS when Paula walked up to him and said, "I\'m going to have that boy." Paula was unmoved and began to show up at INXS gigs everywhere for the next few years...she even brought her daughter (Fifi Geldof).  Yates maintained irregular contact with Hutchence during the intervening nine years and their affair had been underway long before the Big Breakfast interview.  In February 1995, Yates left Geldof.  Geldof and Yates divorced in May 1996. Yates\'s daughter with Hutchence, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence (known as \'Tiger\') was born on 22 July 1996.   On 22 November 1997, Hutchence was found dead in a hotel room in Sydney. Paula Yates wrote in her police statement that Michael Hutchence was "frightened and couldn\'t stand a minute more without his baby."

In July 1977, the summer of the monarch’s Silver Jubilee, Wade won her third major title at the All England Club, with nicely coincided with Wimbledon’s centenary year. Queen Elizabeth II, who made no qualms about not being a tennis fan, was making only her second ever appearance at Centre Court when Wade met Betty Stove of the Netherlands for the championship. “If she’s [Queen Elizabeth II] going to be there, I am going to be there too,” Wade said.  Wade, then 31, and singles champion at the US Open in 1968 and at the Australian Open in 1972, wore a beautiful pink cardigan as she arrived on court. After dropping the first set 4-6, her whole demeanor turned a fiery red in winning the final two sets convincingly, 6-3, 6-1. Wade, who was playing in her 17th\xa0of an all-time record 26 Wimbledons, upset No. 1 seed Chris Evert, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in the semifinals to reach her one and only final. Once she settled into a groove after the first set, her precise groundstrokes controlled the match. “Winning Wimbledon was the thing that made my career worthwhile,” Wade told the Guardian in 1977. Those in attendance witnessed Queen Elizabeth II present Wade with championship trophy and then sang a rendition of “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow” to celebrate the victory.  With her victory in London, Wade held the distinction of being the last Brit to win Wimbledon until Andy Murray in 2013. Her winnings were $20,499, compared to today’s multi-million dollar purse. In an interview with the\xa0Independent\xa0in 2007, Wade joked that her Wimbledon title came right on schedule. “Well, Angela Mortimer had won in 1961 and Ann Jones in 1969, so when I won in 1977 we all thought it happened every eight years, but maybe we were just anomalies, because there was Sue Barker and Joe Durie, but then the [British] players just petered out.”  Wade was a lithe 5-foot-8 steady stroke machine who had a beautiful all-court game built on a smooth slice backhand and a forehand that she could hit with topspin or flat. Wade was a thinker between the lines; her shots were patient and calculated. She was adept at controlling tempo and wouldn’t be forced into foolish shots. She would pause a minimum of five seconds before releasing her serve after getting into the ready position and hopped into position to move laterally or take a short ball and attack the net.  In her lengthy 26-year career, Wade won 55 singles titles, eighth on the all-time list. She favored playing at Wimbledon and the US Open the most of any of the four majors. As a 23-year old in 1968, she won the inaugural US Open, doing so as the No. 6 seed with a stunning and unexpected 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 1 seed Billie Jean King. It was Wade’s fifth trip to the US major and although she would play the event another 15 times, her best finishes afterward were the semifinals in 1969, 1970, and 1975. The 1968 victory earned her $6,000. Wade only traveled to the Australian Open five times, but in 1972 stung another No. 1 seed when defeating crowd favorite and native Evonne Goolagong, who was in the midst of playing in seven consecutive Australian finals, | Question: Prior to Viginia Wade in 1977 who was the last British player to win a tennis Grand Slam title?', ['sue barker'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5406'), ("Context: The Roman Empire ( Latin : Imperium Rōmānum , Classical Latin : ( ɪmˈpɛ. ri. ũː roːˈmaː. nũː ) ; Koine and Medieval Greek : Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων , tr .

On the day of the race he was a 100-1 outsider but the day before he had a 500-1 chance! In fact so bad were his chances that neither his owner or trainer actually attended Aintree on the day to see him race – and if the trainer and the owner don’t believe in you then who is going to?  The general consensus of Foinavon’s poor status was summed up by Daily Express tipster Charles Benson who said at the time: ‘Not the boldest of jumpers, he can be safely ignored, even in a race noted for shocks.’ You can imagine the payouts for those who were crazy (or inspired) enough to bet on him – coming home a winner by fifteen lengths, his success paid out a record 444-1 on the Tote.  Foinavon’s win was a prime example of how the Grand National can throw at you exactly what wasn’t expected. Things had been pretty plain sailing for more than the first half of the race with more than thirty of the forty-four runners getting past the second Becher’s (an accident blackspot if ever there was one). The next fence, the smallest on the course at just four foot six, is where things went wrong for the majority of the competitors, with all of them going down bar Foinavon most notably because he was so far behind the rest of the field.  The pile-up and mayhem was due to the fact that a blinkered Popham Down, who was riderless since the first fence, refused the jump and instead stopped dead to rights in front of the fence meaning that all the subsequent horses ended up crashing into each other. In fact most of the runners ended up flinging their jockey’s over the fence instead. In the words of Lord Oaksey (then rider John Lawrence) Popham Down had: ‘cut down the leaders like a row of thistles.’  Ridden by John Buckingham, Foinavon had, prior to the pandemonium been a hundred yards behind the leaders and upon seeing the chaos ahead, managed to steer wide to the outside and through a gap between loose horses cleared the fence at the first attempt. This gave him a clear hundred yard advantage of the seventeen jockeys that had managed to re-mount and remain in pursuit. All to no avail though – destiny had taken over and Foinavon won comfortably from Honey End, the 15-2 favourite and Red Alligator, who won the race the following year, finished third.  While some condemned the 1967 race as being a farce, the nature of the race – sensational, exciting and injury-free – instilled a newfound respect and demand to ‘save the National’, which was much needed given that at the time Aintree was under threat of sale for building development.  Perhaps unsurprisingly Foinavon did not go on to win another National, but he did have another freak win when at Uttoexeter in October 1968 he trailed home alone after another loose horse brought down the race leader and caused the only other runner to be carried out. Dubbed ‘the National’s luckiest winner ’ Foinavon remains legendary at Aintree with the four foot six fence after Becher’s Brook, where the pile-up of horses occurred following Popham Down’s cut through, named after him.  Only recently has author David Owen managed to eloquently sum up that great day and indeed the story of Foinavon’s life in his new book Foinavon: The Story of the Grand National’s Biggest Upset. It is published by Wisden Sports Writing and has received rave reviews for it’s original, detailed and insightful view of race.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits. "The product just didn\'t stand out from other products on the market," admitted Emma.  Armed with this information Fox\'s added real fruit juice, took out artificial colours and followed market trends to provide products with added benefits.  Since the majority of consumers said that their favourite sweets were either strawberry or blackcurrant flavoured, Fox\'s has also created a new product | Question: What animal is traditionally seen in the branding of Fox\'s Glacier Mints?', ['polar bear'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2327'), ("Context: Edward Anthony Spitzka  Edward Anthony Spitzka (June 17, 1876 – September 4, 1922) was an American anatomist who autopsied (29 Oct 1901) the brain of Leon Czolgosz, the assassin of president William McKinley.

The Philippines , the Philippine Sea , and the Pacific Ocean are to the north; the Arafura Sea and the island of Timor are to the south.  The islands comprise the two Indonesian propinsi (or provinsi; provinces) of North Maluku (Maluku Utara) and Maluku . The principal islands of North Maluku are Halmahera , Obi , Morotai , Bacan , and the main islands of the Sula archipelago (Taliabu, Mangole, and Sulabesi); significant smaller islands include Ternate and Tidore . To the south, the province of Maluku encompasses , most notably, the islands of Ceram (Seram), Buru , and Ambon , as well as the Banda , Wetar , Babar , Tanimbar , Kai , and Aru archipelagos. Area 30,462 square miles (78,897 square km). Pop. (2000) 1,981,401; (2010) 2,571,593.  Geography  Most of the Moluccas are mountainous, although the Tanimbar and Aru island groups are low and swampy. Earthquakes are frequent, and several islands, especially Ternate and Banda , have active volcanoes . The climate of the Moluccas is tropical, with rainfall varying from 80 to 150 inches (2,000 to 3,800 mm) annually in various locations. Some of the land has been cleared for cultivation, but other areas remain covered with evergreen rainforest . There are patches of open savanna , and the coasts are often fringed with mangrove swamps. The Moluccas are a transition zone between Asian and Australian fauna and flora, and the animal life and vegetation of the islands include many species that are unique to the region.  The population of the islands is diverse , with the Ambonese, Butonese (people from the island of Buton in Southeast Sulawesi ), and Kai peoples together constituting roughly one-third of the islands’ residents in relatively equal numbers. Most of the remainder of the population consists of scores of smaller groups, many living in sparsely settled inland regions, as well a notable minority of Chinese descent, concentrated primarily in larger towns and urban areas. The principal cities of the Moluccas include Ambon (on the island of Ambon ), in the central region, and Ternate (on the island of Ternate ), in the north.  Similar Topics  Andaman Islands  Dozens of languages are spoken in the Moluccas, although Malay (of which the national language, Indonesian, is a dialect) has for centuries been used as a lingua franca ; in many areas, Malay has eclipsed local languages. Christianity (mostly Protestant ) and Islam are the dominant religions. A small but notable minority practices Hinduism or Buddhism , and some communities in the interior regions follow local religions. Except in northern Halmahera , Morotai , Ternate, Tidore, and several other areas of the northern Moluccas—where West Papuan languages are spoken—all languages spoken in the islands belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.  Most residents are engaged in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Rice, coconuts, and cocoa are widely grown, and fish, forest products, copra , and spices are among the most significant exports. Petroleum is mined in limited quantities, primarily on Ceram.  History  The cloves of the northern Moluccas and the nutmeg of the central islands were traded in Asia long before Europeans heard of the so-called Spice Islands . The Portuguese established themselves on the islands in 1512, beginning many decades of conflict that caused great losses of life. The first major confrontation was between the Portuguese and the reigning sultans of Ternate and Tidore ; later, the Spanish, English, and Dutch wrestled for control of the islands. Eventually, the Dutch emerged victorious, and they earned large profits from their enterprise in the Moluccas. By the end of the 18th century, however, the spice trade had greatly diminished, and the islands had become an economic backwater.

Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km (203,850 sq mi).  The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi).  It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east-northeast.  Although Yemen\'s constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana\'a, the city has been under rebel control since February 2015.  Because of this, Yemen\'s capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast.  Yemen\'s territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra. | Question: Where was the capital of the Arab country, in which the Aulacodes peribocalis moth is found, relocated to?', ['Aden'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-1871'), ('Context: Brian Ralston  Brian Ralston (born April 12, 1974) is a composer and musician living in Los Angeles.

It lists those places that have been granted city status by letters patent or royal charter. There are currently a total of 69 such cities in the United Kingdom: 51 in England, seven in Scotland, six in Wales, and five in Northern Ireland.  Of these, 23 in England, two in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland possess Lord Mayors and four in Scotland have Lord Provosts. In some cases, the area holding city status does not coincide with the built up area or conurbation of which it forms part. In Greater London, for example, the City of London and that of Westminster each hold city status separately but no other neighbourhood has been granted city status, nor has Greater London as a whole. In other cases, such as the Cities of Canterbury and Lancaster, the status extends over a number of towns and rural areas outside the main settlement proper.Beckett (2005).  History  The initial cities () of Britain were the fortified settlements organized by the Romans as the capitals of the Celtic tribes under Roman rule. The British clerics of the early Middle Ages later preserved a traditional list of the "28 Cities" () which was mentioned by Gildas and listed by Nennius.Nennius (). Theodor Mommsen (). Historia Brittonum, VI. Composed after \xa0830.  Hosted at Latin Wikisource.  The title of city was initially informal and, into the 20th century, royal charters were considered to recognize city status rather than to grant it. The usual criterion in early modern Britain was the presence of a cathedral, particularly after  granted letters patent establishing six new cities when he established a series of new dioceses in the 1540s as part of the English Reformation.  No new cities were created between the 16th and 19th centuries, but following the Industrial Revolution and the accompanying population boom and growth in urbanisation, new sees were established at Ripon (1836) and Manchester (1847); their councils began to style them cities immediately. Inverness in Scotland was even refused a charter at the time of the Jubilee honours of 1897, in part because it would have drawn more attention to the other traditional "cities" still not formally chartered as such.  Beginning in the mid-19th century, however, the process became more formal. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1851 prompted Manchester to petition Parliament for recognition of its status. Ripon followed in the 1860s, and a series of hitherto informal "cities" were formally recognized in the 1880s and 1890s. On the basis of its size, importance, and regular government, Belfast was elevated in spite of its lack of a cathedral in 1888; other large municipalities followed, while smaller applicants began to be rejected.  and the Home Office established three criteria for future applicants in 1907—a minimum population of , a good record of local government, and a "local metropolitan character"—but these criteria were not made public, and following Leicester\'s successful elevation in 1919 a series of exceptions were made. The 1972 Local Government Act effectively eliminated all authorities holding city status outside London on 1 April 1974; most of their replacements were confirmed in their predecessor\'s status—even in cases such as the City of Carlisle, where much of the local authority area is undeveloped countryside—but the Borough of Medway was not permitted to continue Rochester\'s title. In recent times there have been competitions for new grants of city status. Towns or councils that claim city status or add "city" to their name have been known to be rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority.   The cities of Scotland and Ireland were treated separately. Scottish towns irregularly applied the description to themselves, but were formally organized as royal burghs; the special rights of these were preserved by Article XXI of the Treaty of Union which established the single state of Great Britain in 1707.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.

NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort.

To minimize confusion,\xa0‘Sarah’ and ‘Abraham’ are used throughout.  Main themes of the story  Nothing is impossible to God. God had promised Abraham he would be the father of many nations, so when Sarah became post-menopausal she looked for ways to make this happen. She did not trust in God enough to leave the matter in His hands.  The foundation of the Arab nations.  According to the Koran, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael were ancestors of the Arab nations, and of the prophet Mohammed. The Koran says it was at Mecca that God saved Hagar and her son from death by thirst. Muslim ritual reflects this: every year for thirteen centuries Muslims performing the Hajj have retraced Hagar’s steps as she desperately searched for water.  Hagar represents women in the Bible who are excluded or despised. This might happen because they are childless in a society that valued mothers (as Sarah was at first) or a slave in a hierarchical society (as Hagar was at first).  Mother and beloved child  The story has two episodes:  1 The conception and birth of Hagar’s son Ishmael ( Genesis 16:1-16 ). Hagar was an Egyptian slave girl in the tribe of Abraham. She belonged to Sarah, the alpha female of the tribe. When Sarah could not conceive she gave Hagar to her husband as a surrogate. Hagar became pregnant, and God promised that her child would be the ancestor of a great nation. She bore a son, Ishmael.  2 The expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael ( Genesis 21:1-21 ). Hagar was never fully accepted into the tribe despite being the mother of Abraham’s child, and in the end she was rejected completely and expelled into the desert. But God protected her twice from Sarah’s hatred by sending an angel, and eventually Hagar lived as a free woman, not a slave.  See MAPS OF BIBLE LANDS for the location of this story  Hagar —\xa0victim? or upwardly mobile?  Read Genesis 16:1-16  The story of Hagar took place during the late Bronze Age between 2000 and 1550BC, corresponding to the Middle Kingdom period in Egyptian history.  Hagar was an Egyptian girl who was a slave in the household of Sarah, a Hebrew princess. Sarah may have acquired Hagar as part of the generous bride-price paid to her husband Abraham by Pharaoh in Egypt (this story is in Genesis 12:10-20 ).  Ancient wall painting of beautiful Egyptian women  It was an accepted practice at the time to give servants and slaves as part of the dowry of a wealthy young woman. If Hagar was a gift from Pharaoh, she was probably an accomplished servant with valuable skills. Becoming the servant of a nomadic tribeswoman may have been a step down socially for her.  You might take a look at Egyptian love poems in Women in the Bible: the story of Potiphar’s Wife: it will give you some idea of the comparative sophistication of the Egyptians.  Hagar was always disadvantaged among the Hebrew women because she was a foreigner and a slave. This was ironic, since she came from a land that was socially and politically advanced and possessed cities, temples and elaborate burial sites. Egypt had a complex economic system that regulated trade and commerce throughout its empire, and its theology and religion were sophisticated and well ordered.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where  its breaking of conventions   shocked and scandalized its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware  that the work would achieve   international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon;  the "Habanera" from act 1 and the "Toreador Song" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.  The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen\'s love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.  After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.  The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer\'s death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet\'s intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.  Background  In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital\'s two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent.  Bizet\'s professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.    When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances,  it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet\'s student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet\'s wife, Geneviève;  he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach\'s operettas.   Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path".Dean 1965, p. 100 The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.

Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: Taipa  Taipa is an island in Macau, presently united by an artificial landfill to the island of Coloane.

It starred Tony Hancock, with Sid James; the radio version co-starring Hattie Jacques, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams.  Kenneth Williams - Tony Hancock - Bill Kerr - Sid James  The series was written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson and produced by Dennis Main Wilson for most of its run. After Main Wilson departed for his television career, his role was taken by Tom Ronald. The distinctive tuba-based theme tune was composed by Wally Stott.  Comedian Tony Hancock starred in the show, playing an exaggerated and much poorer version of his own character and lifestyle, as a down-at-heel comedian living at the dilapidated 23 Railway Cuttings in East Cheam.  The comedy actor Sid James played a criminally-inclined confidant of Hancock, who usually succeeded in conning him each week; Bill Kerr appeared as Hancock’s Australian lodger, a character who became noticeably dim-witted in the later shows. A young Kenneth Williams, taking his first job in comedy, provided the funny voices for all the minor characters in the show each week. Moira Lister appeared in the first series, before being replaced by Andrée Melly for the next two; both women played love interest for Hancock’s character, in essentially ‘straight’ roles. In the fourth and fifth series a comedienne, Hattie Jacques, provided comedy in the female role as the harridan Grizelda Pugh, who was Hancock’s secretary and Sid’s occasional girlfriend. By this time, Hancock’s difficulties with women had become part of the characterisation.  Tony Hancock  The series broke with the variety tradition which was then dominant in British radio comedy, highlighting a new genre: the sitcom or situation comedy.  Commissioning of series in the UK were then closer to the American practice with extensive runs not unknown, but in this case, with only two writers. Continuity in the idiom was yet to develop, and details changed to suit each episode. The domestic situation varied, but Hancock usually portrayed a ‘resting’ or hopeless down-at-heel actor and/or comedian (though some episodes showed him having runs of success, while some episodes depict him pursuing professional careers as fantasies), James was always on-the-fiddle in some way, Kerr gradually became dim and virtually unemployable (although he had started out as a fast-talking American-style Australian), and Hancock’s ‘secretary’, Miss Pugh, had such a loose job description that in one celebrated episode she had cooked the Sunday lunch.  Hattie Jaques  Hancock’s character had various addresses, but by the third radio series he had arrived at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam. Sometimes this was portrayed as a council house, but occasionally there was a private landlord. In a few early episodes Hancock owned the house, and later this became the norm. The house changed to accommodate the cast: in some episodes it appeared to be a two-bedroom terraced house, with Kerr as Hancock’s lodger; but in series four and five it had at least three bedrooms, as Miss Pugh was also resident in some episodes. In others she ‘came round’ each day, presumably from her own domicile. Railway Cuttings and East Cheam were fictitious, but Cheam is a real town in Surrey, located to the west of Sutton.  Sid James & Tony Hancock  Most of the radio episodes were recorded between one day and three weeks in advance of broadcast, except for Series 6 which was mostly recorded during a three-week period in June 1959 in order to avoid clashing with the recording of Series 5 of the television show.  It should be noted that Galton and Simpson never gave any of their Hancock scripts, for Radio or Television, titles, this was usually left to the girl who filed the scripts at their office, she gave them names that were a reminder of what the script was about, so when Roger Wilmut came to write his book ‘Tony Hancock | Question: Who played Miss Pugh on the Hancock radio show?", ['hattie jacques'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1698'), ("Context: Nixon made guest appearances with Leonard Bernstein 's Young People 's Concerts , including in 1960 , singing `` Improvisation sur Mallarmé I '' from Pli selon pli by Pierre Boulez , and on April 9 , 1961 , in a program entitled `` Folk Music in the Concert Hall '' , singing three `` Songs of the Auvergne '' by Joseph Canteloube .

The term has thus been applied as a name to the speech in its entirety.  It is considered a defining speech in Thatcher\'s political development,  becoming something of a Thatcherite motto.   The phrase made reference to Thatcher\'s refusal to perform a "U-turn" in response to opposition to her liberalisation of the economy, which some commentators and Ted Heath had urged,  mainly because unemployment had risen to 2 million by the autumn of 1980 from 1.5 million the previous year and the economy was in recession,  exceeding 3 million by the time the recession ended in 1982.   It was written by the playwright Sir Ronald Millar, who had been Thatcher\'s speech-writer since 1973, and was a pun on the 1948 play The Lady\'s Not for Burning by Christopher Fry, although Thatcher missed the reference herself.    Millar had intended the "you turn if you want to" line, which preceded it, to be the most popular, and it received an ovation itself, but it was "the lady\'s not for turning" that received the headlines. At the time, Thatcher was already being referred to as the "Iron Lady".  The speech as a whole was very warmly received at the conference, and received a five-minute standing ovation.  Excerpt  United Kingdom general election, 1979The United Kingdom general election of 1979 was held on 3 May 1979 to elect 635 members to the British House of Commons.  The Conservative Party, led by Margaret Thatcher, ousted the incumbent Labour government of James Callaghan with a parliamentary majority of 44 seats.  The election was the first of four consecutive election victories for the Conservative Party, and Thatcher became the United Kingdom and Europe\'s first female elected head of government.  The previous parliamentary term had begun in October 1974, when Harold Wilson led Labour to a majority of three seats, but within 18 months he had resigned as prime minister to be succeeded by James Callaghan, and within a year the government\'s narrow parliamentary majority had gone.  Callaghan had made agreements with the Liberals, the Ulster Unionists, as well as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists in order to remain in power. However, on 28 March 1979 following the defeat of the Scottish devolution referendum, Thatcher tabled a motion of no confidence in James Callaghan\'s Labour government, which was passed by just one vote (311 to 310), triggering a general election five months before the end of the government\'s term.  The Labour campaign was hampered by the series of industrial disputes and strikes during the Winter of 1978-79, known as the Winter of Discontent and the party focused its campaign on support for the National Health Service and full employment. After intense media speculation, Callaghan had announced early in the autumn of 1978 that a general election would not take place that year having received private polling data which suggested a parliamentary majority was unlikely.   The Conservative campaign employed the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi and pledged to control inflation as well as curbing the power of the trade unions.  The Liberal Party was damaged by allegations that its former leader Jeremy Thorpe had been involved in a homosexual affair, and had conspired to murder his former lover.  The Liberals were now being led by David Steel, meaning that all three major parties entered the election with a new leader.  The election saw a 5.2% swing from Labour to the Conservatives, the largest swing since the 1945 election, which Clement Attlee won for Labour.  Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister, and Callaghan was replaced as Labour leader by Michael Foot in 1980.  Results for the election were broadcast live on the BBC, and presented by David Dimbleby, Robert McKenzie, David Butler and Robin Day.   It was the first  general election to feature Rick Wakeman\'s song Arthur on the BBC\'s coverage.

In addition, he has won three Golden Globes and two BAFTAs. He first came to fame in 1967 with his performance as Buck Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, in which he gained his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His major subsequent films include I Never Sang for My Father (1970), in which he gained his second Best Supporting Actor nomination; The French Connection (1971) and French Connection II (1975), in which he played Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle; The Poseidon Adventure (1972); The Conversation (1974); Superman: The Movie (1978), in which he played arch-villain Lex Luthor; Hoosiers (1986); Mississippi Burning (1988), in which he gained his second Best Actor nomination; Unforgiven (1992); The Firm (1993); Crimson Tide (1995); Get Shorty (1995); The Birdcage (1996); Enemy of the State (1998); Behind Enemy Lines (2001); and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).  Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai).

It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything."

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339')]

From the Complete Beethoven Piano Sonatas (No. 1-32) cycle recorded 1983-84 by Barenboim.  The piece was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806. The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna. It was dedicated to Count Franz von Brunswick.  Eric Blom (20 August 1888 – 11 April 1959, the Swiss-born British-naturalised music lexicographer, musicologist, music critic, music biographer and translator) notes that Beethoven was in love at the time with both of the Count’\xads two sisters – Therese von Brunswick, a placid maiden whose appeal was entirely spiritual, and Josephine von Deym, a spirited widow whose attraction was mostly physical. Blom speculates that the raging mood of the Appassionata reflects the duality of these inclinations that plagued Beethoven, and that the dedication to their brother was a discreet way of honoring his feelings.  Like many of his other sonatas, for example, like the “ moonlight sonata “, the name appassionata was,  not given to the work by Beethoven himself. It was actually the publisher of a four-hand edition that gave the Piano Sonata No. 23 the name it is most known by today.  Movements  There are three movements:  Allegro assai A sonata-allegro form in 12/8 time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterized by an economic use of themes. The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G flat). This use of the Neapolitan chord (in music theory, a Neapolitan chord, or simply a “Neapolitan” is a major chord built on the lowered second -supertonic- scale degree) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale. As in Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata , the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the (early 19th-century) piano’s range. The choice of F-minor becomes very clear when one realizes that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.  Andante con moto A set of variations in D flat major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. The four variations follow:  Var. I: similar to the original theme, with the left hand playing on the off-beats.  Var. II: an embellishment of the theme in sixteenth notes.  Var. III: a rapid embellishment in thirty-second notes. A double variation, with the hands switching parts.  Var. IV: a reprise of the original theme without repeats and with the phrases displaced in register.  The fourth variation cadences deceptively on a soft diminished-7th, followed by a much louder diminished seventh that serves as a transition to the finale.  Allegro ma non troppo – Presto A sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion in which, very unusually, only the second part is directed to be repeated. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a faster coda introducing a new theme which in turn leads into an extended | Question: Whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Apassionata'?", ['beethoven', 'ludwig van', 'ludwig van beethoven', 'van beethoven'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6781'), ('Context: BrisbaneBrisbane  is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

Last update: 7 February 2016  Google+175  History and origin  About a 35% of the world population drives on the left , and the countries that do are mostly old British colonies. This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world, but there is a perfectly good reason. Click here for a world map and a full list of all countries of the world and the side of the road on which they drive.  Right-handed knights preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent  In the past, almost everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.  Furthermore, a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse, and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword (which would be worn on the left). It is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road, rather than in the middle of traffic, so if one mounts on the left, then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road.  In the late 1700s, however, teamsters in France and the United States began hauling farm products in big wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. These wagons had no driver’s seat; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse, so he could keep his right arm free to lash the team. Since he was sitting on the left, he naturally wanted everybody to pass on the left so he could look down and make sure he kept clear of the oncoming wagon’s wheels. Therefore he kept to the right side of the road.  In Russia, in 1709, the Danish envoy under Tsar Peter the Great noted the widespread custom for traffic in Russia to pass on the right, but it was only in 1752 that Empress Elizabeth (Elizaveta Petrovna) officially issued an edict for traffic to keep to the right.\xa0In addition, the French Revolution of 1789 gave a huge impetus to right-hand travel in Europe. The fact is, before the Revolution, the aristocracy travelled on the left of the road, forcing the peasantry over to the right, but after the storming of the Bastille and the subsequent events, aristocrats preferred to keep a low profile and joined the peasants on the right. An official keep-right rule was introduced in Paris in 1794, more or less parallel to Denmark, where driving on the right had been made compulsory in 1793.  French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1812)  Later, Napoleon’s conquests spread the new rightism to the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), Switzerland, Germany, Poland and many parts of Spain and Italy. The states that had resisted Napoleon kept left – Britain, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Portugal. This European division, between the left- and right-hand nations would remain fixed for more than 100 years, until after the First World War.  Although left-driving Sweden ceded Finland to right-driving Russia after the Finnish War (1808-1809), Swedish law – including traffic regulations – remained valid in Finland for another 50 years. It wasn’t until 1858 that an Imperial Russian decree made Finland swap sides.  The trend among nations over the years has been toward driving on the right, but Britain has done its best to stave off global homogenisation. With the expansion of travel and road building in the 1800s, traffic regulations were made in every country. Left-hand driving was made mandatory in Britain in 1835.

This film adaptation was directed by David Fincher and written by Steven Zaillian. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, it tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig)\'s investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).  Sony Pictures Entertainment began development on the film in 2009, the year the first, highly acclaimed adaptation of the novel entered cinemas. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.  Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics gave the film favorable reviews, praising its bleak tone and lauding Mara and Craig\'s performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in several publications\' best-of lists, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, and ultimately won nine accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Film Editing.  Plot   In Stockholm, Sweden, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik\'s grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family\'s compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a stun gun, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo on his chest and stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.  Blomkvist\'s daughter Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger\'s lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook\'s content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik\'s openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet\'s brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander\'s research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.  Blomkvist breaks into Martin\'s house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist.

The need for this kind of car, and its functional objectives, was formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country\'s new road network. Hitler contracted Ferdinand Porsche in 1934 to design and build it. Porsche and his team took until 1938 to finalise the design. The influence on Porsche\'s design of other contemporary cars, such as the Tatra V570 and the work of Josef Ganz remains a subject of dispute. The result was one of the first rear-engined cars since the Brass Era. With 21,529,464 produced,  the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured car of a single platform ever made.  Although designed in the 1930s, the Beetle was only produced in significant numbers from 1945 on (mass production had been put on hold during the Second World War) when the model was internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen (or "People\'s Car"). Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302 or 1303, the former three indicating engine displacement, the latter two derived from the type number. The model became widely known in its home country as the Käfer (German for "beetle") and was later marketed as such in Germany, and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the Coccinelle (French for ladybug).  The original 25\xa0hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100\xa0km/h (62 mph), which would be a viable speed on the Reichsautobahn system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40\xa0hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the "classic" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia and Type 2. The Beetle marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout increased from 2.6\xa0percent of continental Western Europe\'s car production in 1946 to 26.6\xa0percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen\'s own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle.  In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.  In the 1999 Car of the Century competition, to determine the world\'s most influential car in the 20th century, the Type 1 came fourth, after the Ford Model T, the Mini, and the Citroën DS.   History   "The People\'s Car"   A 2012 newspaper article\'s claims that Joseph Ganz, a Jewish engineer, inspired the car\'s design   when Adolf Hitler saw the car at an auto show in 1933. but this requires more evidence to be concluded as fact.   In April 1934, Adolf Hitler gave the order to Ferdinand Porsche to develop a Volkswagen (literally, "people\'s car" in German, pronounced).  The epithet Volks- literally, "people\'s-" had been applied to other Nazi-sponsored consumer goods such as the Volksempfänger ("people\'s radio").

The deaths of Billie Holiday, Lester Young, and Sidney Bechet, key artists of the music\'s earlier periods, intensified the pervasive sense that a new era was beginning. In New York, then as now the center of the jazz universe, major developments would set the musical agendas of jazz practitioners for decades to come. Charles Mingus recorded two masterworks, Blues & Roots and Mingus Ah Um, both revealing a novel way for large ensembles to perform complex music without the aid of written-out parts; John Coltrane, with Giant Steps, took vertical, change-running improvisation, an approach traceable all the way back to the first important jazz saxophonist, Coleman Hawkins, to its outer limits and logical conclusion; Miles Davis meanwhile, in the nick of time, nudged Trane toward a new pursuit with Kind of Blue, the modal jazz shot heard \'round the world and perhaps the best-known jazz recording of all time.  These developments alone would grant 1959 the status of an important, ground-breaking year in jazz. However, one event, a portent really, crowded out all others of that crowded year, insuring that the future of jazz really could be read in the tea leaves of 1959. In November, an outfit led by a weird Texas misfit made its New York debut at the Five Spot Cafe, consummating a year when the seeds of much of jazz\'s future were planted. The Ornette Coleman Quartet started a two week engagement (it was later extended to two and a half months), and the music was never the same again.  Coleman and his bandmates treated the harmonic aspect of jazz improvisation in a new way, disavowing the standard practice of running a tune\'s changes and following conventional song forms, in favor of a new approach where unfettered melodic inventiveness was the guiding force. As Coleman put it to writer Martin Williams: "If I\'m going to follow a preset chord sequence, I may as well write out my solo." In finding a way to chart this unfamiliar territory, Coleman took his place among jazz\'s most important innovators, alongside such stellar "establishment" figures as Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker.  Coleman, however, was not immediately given the key to the city. Thanks to the formidable press hype preceding his New York arrival, the jazz community there was quickly induced to take sides. Much of the criticism was downright personal, like Miles Davis\'s reaction: "Hell, just listen to what he writes and how he plays. If you\'re talking psychologically, the man\'s all screwed up inside." Years later, Ornette told record producer/writer John Snyder that one night during the Five Spot gig, Max Roach punched him in the mouth, then showed up at 4 o\'clock the next morning in front of his apartment building, hollering "I know you\'re up there, motherfucker! Come down here and I\'ll kick your ass!"  Not that rejection was a new experience for Ornette Coleman. The first chapters of John Litweiler\'s new biography, Ornette Coleman: A Harmolodic Life, read nearly like a catalog of abuse: Ornette as a teenager in Fort Worth, being held up by his church bandleader as an example of how not to play ("he\'ll never be a saxophone player"); Ornette being fired on the spot from various gigs for solo breaks that stopped dancers in their tracks -- not with admiration, but with anger and alarm; Ornette, touring with a blues band, meeting local musicians who take him outside, beat him bloody and unconscious, and trash his horn; Ornette, sitting in with Dexter Gordon\'s rhythm section in L.A., being ordered by Dex to scram.  Litweiler faced no easy task in pinning down the real story of this enigmatic trailblazer.

Pope's paternal grandfather is supposed to have been Alexander Pope, rector of Thruxton, Hampshire (instituted 1 May 1630–1; information from the Winchester bishop's register, communicated by Mr. J. C. Smith, of Somerset House), who died in 1645. The poet's father, according to his epitaph, was seventy-five at his death, 23 Oct. 1717, and therefore born in 1641 or 1642 (see also P. T.'s letter to Curll in Pope's Works, by Elwin and Courthope, vi. 423, where he is said to have been a posthumous son). According to Warton, he was a merchant at Lisbon, where he was converted to catholicism. He was afterwards a linendraper in Broad Street, London. A first wife, Magdalen, was buried 12 Aug. 1679 (register of St. Benet Fink); he had by her a daughter Magdalen, afterwards Mrs. Rackett; and in the Pangbourne register, Ambrose Staveley, the rector, records the burial of 'Alexander Pope, son of my brother-in law, Alexander Pope, merchant of London,' on 1 Sept. 1682 ( information from Mr. J. C. Smith). Pope's statement in a note in the Epistle to Arbuthnot, that his father belonged to the family of the earls of Downe, appears to have been a fiction (Warton, Essay, ii. 255). The poet's maternal grandfather descended from a family of small landowners in Yorkshire. He had seventeen children, one of whom, Edith, the poet's mother, was baptised on 18 June 1642, though, according to her epitaph, she was ninety-three at her death on 7 June 1733. Christiana, another daughter, married the portrait-painter, Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) [q. v.], and at her death in 1693, left some china, pictures, and medals to her nephew. Three of her sons, according to Pope's statement (Epistle to Arbuthnot), were in the service of Charles I. Alexander Pope, the linendraper, after his second marriage, moved his business to Lombard Street. He made some money by his trade, and in or before 1700 moved to Binfield in Windsor Forest. It appears from his will (Carruthers, Pope, 1857, p. 463) that he had some landed property, and he also invested money in French rentes (Works, vi. 189, 201). The story, first told by Ruffhead, that he put all his money in a strong-box and lived upon the principal, is therefore erroneous. As a catholic, he was exposed to various disqualifications; but he appears to have lived comfortably among the country gentry. He had many friends among the Roman catholics, several of whom lived near the forest. He was fond of gardening, and had twenty acres of land round his house at Binfield. One room of the house is said to remain, and a row of Scottish firs near it was apparently there in Pope's time.  Pope was precocious, and in his infancy healthy. He was called the ‘little nightingale’ from the beauty of his voice, a name still applied to him in later years by the dramatist Southern (Ruffhead, p. 476; Orrery, Swift, p. 207). A portrait, painted when he was ten years old, showed him ‘plump and pretty, and of a fresh complexion.’ This is said to have been like him at the time; but a severe illness two years later, brought on by ‘perpetual application,’ ruined his health and distorted his figure (Spence | Question: What was the first name of the poet Mr. Pope, 1688-1744?", ['alexander'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1860'), ('Context: Lucy Gichuhi  Lucy Muringo Gichuhi (née Munyiri) ( ) (born 23 September 1962) is an Australian politician who is a Senator for South Australia, sitting as an independent.

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."

Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'

Duke of York  \xa0  From Wikipedia  \xa0  " HMS Duke of York was a King George V-class battleship of the Royal Navy. Laid down in May 1937, the ship was constructed by John Brown and Company at Clydebank, Scotland, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 4 November 1941, subsequently seeing service during the Second World War.  \xa0  In mid-December 1941 Duke of York transported Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the United States to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt. On 1 March 1942, Duke of York provided close escort for convoy PQ 12, along with the battlecruiser Renown, the cruiser Kenya and six destroyers. In October 1942, Duke of York was involved in the Allied invasion of North Africa, but saw little action as her role only required her to protect the accompanying aircraft carriers.  \xa0  On 26 December 1943 Duke of York was part of a taskforce which made contact with the German battleship Scharnhorst. During the engagement which followed, Scharnhorst hit Duke of York twice with little effect, but was herself hit by several of Duke of York\'s 14-inch shells, silencing one of her turrets and hitting a boiler room. After temporarily escaping from Duke of York\'s heavy fire, Scharnhorst was struck several times by torpedoes, allowing Duke of York to again open fire, contributing to the eventual sinking of Scharnhorst after a running action lasting 10 and a half hours. In 1945 Duke of York was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet as its flagship, but suffered mechanical problems in Malta which prevented her arriving in time to see any action before Japan surrendered.  \xa0  Duke of York was laid up in November 1951 and on 18 May 1957 she was ordered to be scrapped, which was carried out by Shipbreaking Industries, Ltd, in Faslane.  \xa0  Construction  \xa0  The Terms of the 1930 Treaty of London extended the ban on battleship construction introduced in 1922, and by 31 December 1936 it was realised that Britain was woefully short of modern battleships. During this period the Admiralty set in motion plans for the construction of a new battleship class, resulting in the drawing up of designs for the King George V class. The proposed ships were projected to have limited armament as the Washington Treaty was still in effect. Because of the urgent need for battleships the Admiralty did not have enough time to re-work the plans to a more suitable 16-inch main gun arrangement.  \xa0  Duke of York was laid down at John Brown & Company\'s shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, on 5 May 1937 and was launched on 28 February 1940. Duke of York was completed on 4 November 1941 and then joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow.  \xa0  King George V class battleship (1939)  \xa0  Duke of York displaced 36,727 long tons (37,300 t) as built and 42,076 long tons (42,800 t) fully loaded. The ship had an overall length of 700 feet (213.4 m), a beam of 103 feet (31.4 m) and a draught of 29 feet (8.8 m). Her designed metacentric height was 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) feet at normal load and 8 feet 1 inch (2.46 m) feet at deep load.  \xa0  She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four propeller shafts. Steam was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers which normally delivered 100,000 shaft horsepower (75,000 kW), but could deliver 110,000 shp (82,000 kW) at emergency overload.[N 1] This gave Duke of York a top speed of 28 knots (52 km/h; 32 mph).[8][9] The ship carried 3,700 long tons (3,800 t) of fuel oil, which was later increased to 4,030 long tons (4,100 t).[5] She also carried 183 long tons (200 t) of diesel oil, 256 long tons (300 t) of reserve feed water and 430 long tons (400 t) of freshwater.[10] At full speed | Question: What German battleship was sunk in December 1943 during the Battle of the North Cape, by HMS Duke of York and her escorts?', ['scharnhorst'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5050'), ("Context: The signing of the Residence Act on July 16 , 1790 , approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country 's East Coast .

The shamisen had many forms before it arrived to Japan, though it’s unclear where it originated from. It is said that a three stringed lute arrived in China during the later years of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). This instrument is called the sanxian. Trade flourished between China and the Ryukyu kingdom (Okinawa). Many instruments were brought over, including their sanxian, now called the Okinawan Sanshin. It is said to have been brought over by merchants from Fukien in 1392, a time when there was considerable immigration from southern China.  The Sanxian  Now we come to it’s arrival to Japan. It’s generally said that the sanshin came to Japan in 1562, in the city of Sakai (a port city south of Osaka). It’s assumed to have come from Okinawa, though with all the trade that was happening with China, direct importation was by no means out of the question. There probably were Chinese sanxian in Japan before 1562, but not in significant enough numbers to start anything. The Okinawan sanshin is what caused the shamisen to be taken up by the Japanese.  Soon after, biwa players took up the sanshin (now called the shamisen) so they could be better heard on the street. And being the first players of the instrument in Japan, they could do what they wanted with it! And do they did.  Kusakabe Kimbei - Geshia Playing Shamisen  The shamisen is a plucked stringed instrument. Its construction follows a model similar to that of a guitar or a banjo, with a neck and strings stretched across a resonating body. The neck of the shamisen is fretless and slimmer than that of a guitar or banjo. The body, called the dō , resembles a drum, having a hollow body that is taut front and back with skin, in the manner of a banjo. The sao, or neck of the shamisen is usually divided into three or four pieces that fit and lock together. Indeed, most shamisen are made so that they can be easily disassembled and stowed to save space. The neck of the shamisen is a singular rod that crosses the drum-like body of the instrument, partially protruding at the other side of the body and there acting as an anchor for the strings. The pegs used to wind the strings are long, thin and hexagonal in shape. They were traditionally fashioned out of ivory, but as it has become a rare resource, they have been recently fashioned out of other materials, such as various kinds of wood and plastic.  The three strings are traditionally made of silk, or, more recently, nylon. Traditionally, silk strings are used. However, silk breaks easily over a short time, so this is reserved for professional performances. Students often use nylon or ‘tetron’ strings, which last longer than silk, and are also less expensive.  Shamisen maker with a customer  The shamisen can be played solo or with other shamisen, in ensembles with other Japanese instruments, with singing such as nagauta, or as an accompaniment to drama, notably kabuki and bunraku. Both men and women traditionally played the shamisen.  The most famous and perhaps most demanding of the narrative styles is gidayū, named after Takemoto Gidayū (1651–1714), who was heavily involved in the bunraku puppet-theater tradition in Osaka. The gidayū shamisen and its plectrum are the largest of the shamisen family, and the singer-narrator is required to speak the roles of the play, as well as to sing all the commentaries on the action. From the 19th century female performers known as onna-jōruri or onna gidayū also carried on this concert tradition.

She held a bouquet in one hand and with the other picked furiously at something stuck on the ice, desperate to ensure the surface was perfect for the two competitors waiting their turn. Out of sight, they watched and a country watched with them, millions upon millions waiting, united in a universal anxiety. Perfection was not to be long delayed.  Satisfied with her precise labours, the girl made for the small gate that led off the ice. Jayne Torvill smiled down at her as she scrambled off, her skates now a clumsy hindrance. Alongside Torvill, Christopher Dean stared ahead, inscrutable, his face a mask of calm, his long slender neck, accentuated by his collarless top, giving him the serene air of a swan on the summer water.  The ice was Dean\'s natural habitat, and, at last, the girl banished contentedly into the depths of the Zetra stadium, he led his partner on to the rink.  The gate was closed behind them and they skated briskly to the centre, the brilliance of the ice and the whitewashed wall blurring the spectators and highlighting Torvill and Dean, each clad in billowing tops of darkening purple, he in black trousers and black skates, she in a short dress, also purple, and white skates. It was the evening of Valentine\'s Day, 1984, and in Sarajevo, the host city of the XIV Winter Olympics, two Britons were on the brink of passing forever into sporting greatness.  "My whole family went round to my granny\'s – we always went there for special events like royal weddings. I remember being very nervous – there was so much expectation. And it was just perfect."  Fran, aged 14 in 1984  Whatever the standing of ice dancing as an Olympic sport – a debate for another time, and it would be far from alone in the dock – the simple truth is that on that night in the former Yugoslavia, Torvill and Dean executed an achievement of immense worth. Sport may become, as the Olympic movement demands, relentlessly faster, higher, stronger, but grace spans ages, through a Bradman drive to a Cruyff turn and on to a Federer forehand. Torvill and Dean, artists on ice, reached the rare ground of sporting perfection. What is more, under an almost intolerable weight of expectation, they captured a nation.  Twenty-four million people watched the BBC (the corporation was so fearful of the host broadcaster cutting away during the routine that they covered it with just their own single hand-held camera), a figure that astonishes almost as much as the string of sixes that was to be strung across the screen once the pair\'s finale had left them laid out on the ice. It was double the number who watched the 2008 Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea and nearly 5 million more than viewed England\'s 1990 World Cup semi-final against Germany.

He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover.

Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up.

In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.  The west consists largely of poor subsoils and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket bog, whereas the east is largely a limestone landscape.  Agricultural land is therefore more productive in the east than in the west.  *The highest point in Mayo (and Connacht) is Mweelrea, at 814 m  *The River Moy in the northeast of the county is renowned for its salmon fishing  *Ireland\'s largest island, Achill Island, lies off Mayo\'s west coast  *Mayo has Ireland\'s highest cliffs at Croaghaun, Achill Island,  while the Benwee Head cliffs in Kilcommon Erris drop almost perpendicularly 900 ft into the Atlantic Ocean.   )  *The northwest areas of County Mayo have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, if not the world, in terms of wind resources, ocean wave, tidal and hydroelectric resources     Local government and political subdivisions  Mayo County Council () is the authority responsible for local government.  As a county council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. The County is divided into four municipal areas Castlebar, Ballina, Claremorris and West (an area which stretches from Westport to Belmullet). The council is responsible for housing and community, roads and transportation, urban planning and development, amenity and culture, and environment. For the purpose of local elections the county is divided into its four municipal districts, replacing the former six local electoral areas: Ballina (6), Belmullet (4), Castlebar (7), Claremorris (6), Swinford (4) and Westport (4).

Unsurprisingly, the Czech capital can also get busy as thousands of tourists jostle for space.  Here is a selection of things to do during a visit to the city - from taking in its best-loved sights to stopping for a drink at a beautifully restored cafe and watching a comic take on a famous Mozart opera.  1... New Jerusalem  Emperor Charles IV planned this intensely beautiful city as the ‘New Jerusalem’ in the 14th Century, and architects maintained the vision until its last golden age in the Thirties. The old centre, with outstanding buildings such as Valdstejn Palace, St James’ Church and St Vitus Cathedral, is still largely intact after 800 years and is now a World Heritage Site.  With nifty footwork you can outwit the crowds. Try walking the famous Charles Bridge before breakfast, and save the striking of the Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Square until the evening when it’s quieter. I also like the peacefulness of Mala Strana, the cafe-lined cobbled streets under Prague Castle. And take a tram to the Jewish Quarter and wander Petrin Hill for wonderful views over the city’s baroque roofs.  Atmospheric: Prague's beautiful Charles Bridge  2... Grand re-opening  How about this for a comeback? The Grand Cafe Orient ( www.grandcafeorient.cz ) opened in 1912 in the House of the Black Madonna, Prague’s architectural take on cubism, the art form Picasso championed. The cafe closed eight years later when cubism fell out of favour but reopened in 2005, faithfully recreated with period furniture and fittings. Try the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  Another venue, the Mysak pastry shop, reopened in 2008 inside the Mysak Gallery ( www.gallerymysak.cz ), with original doors, mosaics floors, a marble staircase and wooden alcoves. The signature dish is karamelovy pohar – ice cream topped with caramel, chocolate and walnuts.

The Museum of Communism ( www.muzeumkomunismu.cz ) tells the story of those lost years. I came closest to Prague’s tragedy and eventual triumph on the steps of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square. I looked down on the bronze cross at the spot where Jan Palach burnt himself to death in protest in 1969. It's also where people celebrated their new-found freedom after 1989’s so-called Velvet Revolution.  Historic: The Duke of Bohemia is represented by an equestrian statue in Wenceslas Square  4...Recovered treasures  In 1989, William Lobkowicz returned to Prague from exile in Boston to restore the great estate his family had built up over 700 years. It had been confiscated first by the Nazis, then by the communists. Diligent legal teams gradually recovered land, thousands of books, paintings and pieces of furniture. William’s mission culminated in the opening of Lobkowicz Palace in 2007, with its exhibition of the best of the family’s reclaimed treasures. Star exhibits include two views of the River Thames by Canaletto and Haymaking by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.  Another of the city’s new attractions is totally different. The Kafka Museum ( www.kafkamuseum.cz ) celebrates the writer (he was born here) whose name stands for the way the ordinary man is defeated by ‘the system’.  5...Pulling the strings  With his mischievous sense of fun, Mozart would have approved of the National Marionette Theatre’s comic performances of his opera Don Giovanni ( www.mozart.cz ).

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies. Skylab was 30.2 metres (99 feet) in length and 6.7 metres (22 feet) in diameter and had a mass of about 75,000 kg (165,000 pounds). Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research. Its main scientific instrument, the Apollo Telescope Mount , incorporated a number of component telescopes and other devices for observing the Sun over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum , from visible light through X-rays .

During Skylab’s ascent a thermal meteoroid shield was ripped off, which led to the loss of one of the lateral solar power arrays that was to supply electricity to the station and prevented full extension of the other. The first three-man crew deployed an improvised “parasol” sunshade (later fortified with an overlying sun shield) to prevent serious overheating of the station during their 28-day mission and released the jammed solar array. Skylab hosted two additional three-man crews for missions lasting 59 and 84 days. Each of the three Skylab missions set a new space endurance record. Although plans called for Skylab to be used again with one of the first space shuttle missions boosting it to a higher orbit, increased solar activity caused its orbit to degrade faster than expected.

He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ("Context: How to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 American 3D computer - animated action fantasy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures .

It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George\'s Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan.  While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern ("New Pomerania").  Geography  New Britain extends from 148°18\'31" to 152°23\'57" E longitude and from 4°08\'25" to 6°18\'31" S latitude. It is crescent-shaped, approximately 520 km along its southeastern coastline, and from 29 to 146\xa0km (18–91\xa0miles) wide, not including a small central peninsula. The air-line distance from west to east is 477 km. The island is the 38th largest in the world, with an area of .  Steep cliffs form some sections of the coastline; in others the mountains are further inland, and the coastal area is flat and bordered by coral reefs. The highest point, at 2,438\xa0m (7,999\xa0ft), is Mount Sinewit in the Baining range in the east. Most of the terrain is covered with tropical rainforest and several large rivers are fed by the high rainfall.  New Britain was largely formed by volcanic processes, and there are several active volcanoes on the island, including Ulawun (the highest volcano in Papua New Guinea), Langila, the Garbuna Group, the Sulu Range, and the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan of the Rabaul caldera. A major eruption of Tavurvur in 1994 destroyed the East New Britain provincial capital of Rabaul. Most of the town still lies under metres of ash, and the capital has been moved to nearby Kokopo.  Administrative divisions  New Britain forms part of the Islands Region, one of four regions of Papua New Guinea.

In November 1884, Germany proclaimed its protectorate over the New Britain Archipelago; the German colonial administration gave New Britain and New Ireland the names of Neupommern (or Neu-Pommern; "New Pomerania") and Neumecklenburg (or Neu-Mecklenburg; "New Mecklenburg") respectively, and the whole island group was renamed the Bismarck Archipelago. New Britain became part of German New Guinea.  In 1909, the indigenous population was estimated at about 190,000; the foreign population at 773 (474 white). The expatriate population was practically confined to the northeastern Gazelle Peninsula, which included the capital, Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo). At the time 5,448 hectares (13,464 acres) had been converted to plantations, primarily growing copra, cotton, coffee and rubber. Westerners avoided exploring the interior initially, believing that the indigenous peoples were warlike and would fiercely resist intrusions.  World War I  On 11 September 1914, New Britain became the site of one of the earliest battles of World War I when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island. They quickly overwhelmed the German forces and occupied the island for the duration of the war.  Between the world wars  After World War I the Treaty of Versailles was signed in June 1919, where Germany was stripped on all its possessions outside Europe. In 1920 the League of Nations included New Britain along with the former German colony on New Guinea in the Territory of New Guinea, a mandated territory of Australia.  World War II  During World War II the Japanese attacked New Britain soon after the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean. Strategic bases at Rabaul and Kavieng (New Ireland) were defended by a small Australian detachment, Lark Force. | Question: New Britain and New Ireland are two of the islands that make up which country?', ['papua new guinea'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6376'), ("Context: Lake Como Travel Guide and Attractions - About.com TravelLake Como Travel Guide and Attractions  Updated May 04, 2016.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

We caught a few glimpses of the result early in Kill Bill Vol. 1 with the wreckage left behind when Bill and the Vipers assaulted a tiny rural chapel and slaughtered everyone in sight. Vol. 2 gives us, for the first time, a full account of the wedding rehearsal massacre that sets the plot of this two-part epic in motion. After fending off attacks from Bill’s trailer-trash kid brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and her chief rival within the Squad, Daryl Hannah’s Elle Driver, The Bride tracks her ultimate quarry to his lair in Mexico.  It might be a slight exaggeration to describe Kill Bill Vol. 2 as a “relationship movie.” But it may look like one, at times, in comparison with the wall-to-wall Asian swordplay action of Vol. 1 . Both films are still, as Carradine says, “kung-fu samurai Spaghetti Western love stories.” But as the actor noted in a recent published interview: “ The second one has got a lot more of what you’re used to from Quentin; the quirky character stuff, the surprises, the funny stuff.”  In Kill Bill Vol. 1 , actor David Carradine was almost entirely a sinister presence behind the scenes, a familiar, seductive, baritone voice murmuring on the soundtrack\xad—despite the fact that he played the movie’s title role. But along with Uma Thurman, who continues to cut a wide swath as the revenge-driven Bride, “David dominates Vol. 2 ,” according to writer-director Quentin Tarantino.  When I tell people the name of the movie is Kill Bill ,” Carradine says, “and that I’m Bill, they ask me: ‘Well, what are you, the bad guy?’ And I have to tell ’em, ‘There are no good guys in a Quentin Tarantino movie. It’s all about the bad guys.’ The essence of a Tarantino movie is an inside look at the minds and hearts of violent people. That’s what we go to see his movies for. It’s climbing inside these people’s psyches and showing what makes them tick. There’s a nobility about Bill, yet you also know he’s one of the most evil people you’ve ever met in your life. “Bill is more fun than anything,” Carradine recently told The Associated Press. “Bill has virtually no human problems. He’s just kind of put himself above it all.”  In Vol. 1 we learned that Bill, a broker of killers for hire, had assembled and trained a ruthless assortment of assassins, the so-called Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS). Each of these gifted murderers was code-named for a different species of poisonous snake: O’Ren-Ishii (Lucy Liu) was Cottonmouth, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) was California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) was Copperhead, and Budd (Michael Madsen), Bill’s kid brother and the only other male in the Viper Squad, was known as Sidewinder.  The lethal weapon known as Black Mamba, played by Thurman, the most talented of them all, was also Bill’s lover, and she became a fugitive from the assassination game when she learned that she was pregnant with his child. At that moment her worldview shifted on its axis. She no longer wanted to kill or to put her life in mortal danger. She changed her name, hid out in a small town, and found herself a kind and stable man to a marry.  But Bill was not about to let this situation stand.

But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission.

Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur.

Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.

It starred Tony Hancock, with Sid James; the radio version co-starring Hattie Jacques, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams.  Kenneth Williams - Tony Hancock - Bill Kerr - Sid James  The series was written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson and produced by Dennis Main Wilson for most of its run. After Main Wilson departed for his television career, his role was taken by Tom Ronald. The distinctive tuba-based theme tune was composed by Wally Stott.  Comedian Tony Hancock starred in the show, playing an exaggerated and much poorer version of his own character and lifestyle, as a down-at-heel comedian living at the dilapidated 23 Railway Cuttings in East Cheam.  The comedy actor Sid James played a criminally-inclined confidant of Hancock, who usually succeeded in conning him each week; Bill Kerr appeared as Hancock’s Australian lodger, a character who became noticeably dim-witted in the later shows. A young Kenneth Williams, taking his first job in comedy, provided the funny voices for all the minor characters in the show each week. Moira Lister appeared in the first series, before being replaced by Andrée Melly for the next two; both women played love interest for Hancock’s character, in essentially ‘straight’ roles. In the fourth and fifth series a comedienne, Hattie Jacques, provided comedy in the female role as the harridan Grizelda Pugh, who was Hancock’s secretary and Sid’s occasional girlfriend. By this time, Hancock’s difficulties with women had become part of the characterisation.  Tony Hancock  The series broke with the variety tradition which was then dominant in British radio comedy, highlighting a new genre: the sitcom or situation comedy.  Commissioning of series in the UK were then closer to the American practice with extensive runs not unknown, but in this case, with only two writers. Continuity in the idiom was yet to develop, and details changed to suit each episode. The domestic situation varied, but Hancock usually portrayed a ‘resting’ or hopeless down-at-heel actor and/or comedian (though some episodes showed him having runs of success, while some episodes depict him pursuing professional careers as fantasies), James was always on-the-fiddle in some way, Kerr gradually became dim and virtually unemployable (although he had started out as a fast-talking American-style Australian), and Hancock’s ‘secretary’, Miss Pugh, had such a loose job description that in one celebrated episode she had cooked the Sunday lunch.  Hattie Jaques  Hancock’s character had various addresses, but by the third radio series he had arrived at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam. Sometimes this was portrayed as a council house, but occasionally there was a private landlord. In a few early episodes Hancock owned the house, and later this became the norm. The house changed to accommodate the cast: in some episodes it appeared to be a two-bedroom terraced house, with Kerr as Hancock’s lodger; but in series four and five it had at least three bedrooms, as Miss Pugh was also resident in some episodes. In others she ‘came round’ each day, presumably from her own domicile. Railway Cuttings and East Cheam were fictitious, but Cheam is a real town in Surrey, located to the west of Sutton.  Sid James & Tony Hancock  Most of the radio episodes were recorded between one day and three weeks in advance of broadcast, except for Series 6 which was mostly recorded during a three-week period in June 1959 in order to avoid clashing with the recording of Series 5 of the television show.

Larry Pitcher, the park's director of marketing and sales, told The Kansas City Star: 'We have always been family friendly, but this will attract those adrenaline junkies who are always lookingf or that next biggest, coolest thrill.'  The rafts will drop more than 130ft before being sent up another five-storey tall hump and then down again into the pool.

World's Largest Building by Area Is China's New Century ...World's Largest Building by Area Is China's New Century Global Center | New Republic  By Christopher Beam  November 6, 2013  The slogan of the New Century Global Center, the recently completed largest building in the world by floor space, sounds at first like a Chinglish-y misfire: “The One of Everything.” But as I spent a day wandering around the structure, located in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, the catchphrase started to take on a kind of brilliance.

He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797.  In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  It is often  first Gothic  novel  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.  Notes by Lesley Young  WALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The) - naxos.comWALPOLE, H.: Castle of Otranto (The)  The Castle of Otranto  \xa0  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister. He himself was an M.P. from 1741 to 1768. He died in 1797. In 1747, Walpole leased a small house he called Strawberry Hill in Twickenham, near London. Two years later he bought it and began remodelling it as a ‘little Gothic castle’, later adding a cloister, gallery and tower.  In 1757, Walpole set up a printing press at Strawberry Hill, publishing his own Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors (1758) and Anecdotes of Painting in England (1762–1771) as well as a dramatic tragedy, The Mysterious Mother, in 1768. In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, | Question: 'The Castle of Otranto' often called the first gothic novel, was written in 1764 by whom?", ['horace walpole'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4725'), ("Context: The word pope derives from Greek πάππας meaning `` father '' .

With a cheeky nod to the Irish actor, the tram has become known as the \'Daniel Day\'.  \'Luas\' means speed in Irish Gaelic, and it is indeed a speedy and now generally well-loved means of travel. It started carrying passengers in 2004, runs for almost 30 km and there are 40 stations along the way, carrying just under 100,000 passengers each day. The cost of delivering the tram system to the city was around €750m as opposed to an original quote of around €250m.  The Luas was fiercely promoted as a green alternative and this is the clear message on the Luas website where they tell you exactly how many car journeys and tonnes of emissions have been saved.  The trams run from as early as 5.30am some days until after midnight, and you only ever need to wait about five minutes before one comes along. They are relatively safe, although there have been a couple of accidents, the most recent of which was in September 2009 when 21 people were injured during a crash between a bus and a tram .  There are two separate lines: a red line serving the area north of the city centre out as far as Tallaght. The green line goes south from St Stephen\'s Green to Sandyford which is a business district to the south of the city centre. It is the green line that I use most frequently when I visit Dublin as it serves Dundrum\'s shops and cinema, and Ranelagh\'s coffee shops and restaurants.  It was in Ranelagh I caught up with Gerry Breen, Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had not travelled out on the Luas himself, preferring his official car for the journey, but he is nonetheless a great supporter.  He said: "The Luas is an unmitigated success for Dublin. I think that is largely because the operating contract was awarded to Veolia which is a single union employer. They are also very strict about safety. Prior to opening the Luas the roadworks were however a problem. Lower Abbey Street in particular comes to mind. It was in a state and so was Harcourt Street.  "I\'ve just been to Nice where there is a smaller tram system. Nonetheless it has taken a lot of traffic out of the city centre. The proposal is to run a Metro North to the Airport in Dublin but it is pretty marginal in cost benefit terms. One issue with the Luas is that on one of the lines there is significant interaction with the traffic on the public road and that can be problematic."  Stephen Giles, a medicinal chemistry student at Trinity College Dublin, thinks it is more comfortable than the bus . He told me: "I think it\'s great. Its really handy. I have used it since it started and it is cheaper than the bus. It\'s a really good transport system."  Eadine Hickey is a mother of two young children whose tram use is fuelled by concern for the environment and the fact her daughter gets awarded a sticker at school if she travels there by public transport.

Uploaded on Jun 12, 2006  From Introducing Morrissey  You\'re the One for Me, Fatty"You\'re the One for Me, Fatty" is a single by Morrissey released in April 1992. It was taken from the then-unreleased Your Arsenal album and was the second Morrissey single to be written by Alain Whyte and produced by glam rock legend Mick Ronson.  Although the lyrics seemed a typically tongue-in-cheek Morrissey love song towards an overweight person, in reality the words were an in-joke directed at Madness singer Chas Smash whom Morrissey had recently befriended. Smash has since confessed that he is the subject of the song.  The title is a pun on the Marvelettes\' song You Are The One for Me Bobby.  The track reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart.  Track listings  All lyrics by Morrissey.   Musicians  *Morrissey: vocals  *Alain Whyte: guitar  *Boz Boorer: guitar  *Gary Day: bass guitar  *Spencer Cobrin: drums  Reviews  This single was described by Ned Raggett in AllMusic as "[a] smart, lively cut...with the overall title and overall mood still being as classically Morrissey as it gets." Raggett did not think the B-sides were as strong in comparison but still "fine enough numbers, further evidence as to how the Your Arsenal sessions had re-energized [Morrissey]." Raggett concludes his review, writing, "The tone throughout is relaxed and fun, almost in spite of some of the lyrics".  Live performances  The song has been performed live by Morrissey on his 1992, 1995, 2011 and 2012 tours.  You’re The One For Me Fatty | TYCIYou’re The One For Me Fatty – TYCI  24  I was 10lb 8oz when I was born, several years later my mother needed a pelvic floor repair because I had destroyed her. When I asked her what exactly her cravings were, she replied ‘fruit’ – the irony.  34 years on and I have grown proportionally to my birth weight, i.e. I am still a large mammal. When you are fat/overweight/chubby etc. it is the first thing you think about each day. I just want to dispel the theory that you don’t think about food as soon as your eyes open. Other thoughts that have run through my head include ‘what the hell am I going to wear to make me more inconspicuous’ and ‘I swear today is going to be my healthy day’.  My childhood never had a lack of food, when I first heard the phrase ‘big boned’ I latched onto it and looking back I can laugh now. My dad is Moroccan and as part of the culture, if you don’t eat then it can be seen as a bit of an insult. My mother is British and came from the traditional Sunday Roast and ‘Fish Friday’ so food was constantly in abundance between them. I wouldn’t exactly put them in the category of ‘feeder’; they just cared about their kids and wanted to make sure they were provided for.

Dave Shelton, co-creator of the line with Liz Whinston, explains the thought process behind the original campaign adverts ,  “We started to write a commercial that featured a straightforward guy who said lines like: "If you\'ve got wood to stain and you want it to dry quickly, you need Ronseal Quick Drying Woodstain."  We\'d soon knocked out several scripts but we needed a line… "Does exactly what it says on the tin" was a great way of summing this up.  After the initial campaign, sales shot up and Ronseal became [a] brand leader.”  ‘Does exactly what it says on the tin’ is now more than an advertising slogan; it has become part of our everyday vernacular. The line has made it into the Oxford Dictionary of Idioms, been featured in the song ‘What it Says On The Tin’ by Katie Melua, and has even been used by Prime Minister David Cameron and on multiple occasions to summarise his preferred approach to politics.  The phrase has come to represent a product or policy that is open, honest and delivers against its promise.  The phrase is now used internationally and it’s not surprising it has become the third most known slogan of all time.  \xa0  \xa0  [1] The phrase is a registered trademark of Ronseal’s owner, the Sherwin-Williams Company , across the European Community for products including paints, varnishes and wood preservatives (E3085826)  [3] Source Creative Review February 2012  \xa0  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tinThe Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin - BBC News  BBC News  The Ronseal phrase: It does exactly what it says on the tin  8 January 2013  Read more about sharing.  Close share panel  Prime Minister David Cameron used a famous advertising slogan to sum up the state of the coalition government at its halfway point, saying "it is a Ronseal deal - it does what it says on the tin". This phrase has entered the British vernacular, says its co-creator Dave Shelton.  David Cameron has said it before. In 2004, he said: "People are crying out for a kind of Ronseal politics - they want it to do what it says on the tin."  People use the phrase every day. On YouTube you can listen to Katie Melua\'s What It Says On The Tin . Google the line and you get millions of results.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb.

I find it incredible that Maurice is no longer alive'\xa0  Olga Craig  12:01AM BST 13 Jul 2008  Robin Gibb, co-creator of the most gloriously shallow pop ever, now wears several deeply serious hats: guardian of British heritage, confidante of world leaders, and 21st century Mozart. He talks to Olga Craig. Portrait by Eva Vermandel  Robin Gibb is gazing at a bear at the bottom of his garden. Glinting in the afternoon sunshine, the 6ft grizzly is upright, poised motionless on muscular hind legs, left paw outstretched menacingly. Just as well, then, that it is sculpted in stone.  'It was a birthday present from my wife, Dwina,' Gibb says, sipping from a mug, decorated, appropriately enough, with festive robins. 'I like the sort of juxtaposition, the mix of the modern with the historic,' he says, pouring more tea from a cream Delft teapot that has got to hold a gallon of liquid at least.  The 'modern' is an array of huge stone statues, from bunnies to birds, that litter the magnificent 100-acre fairytale garden of his Oxfordshire home. The 'historic' is his manor house itself, a 12th-century former monastery that he has spent 20 years restoring.  'The Bishops decided Joan of Arc's fate in the chapel here. Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn stayed here in 1533 on one of their progresses. Oh, and Baroness Sophie Wenham conducted her affair with William IV here,' he rhymes off. 'There's a very old set of stone steps outside that the Baroness used to climb into her carriage. She was short. Dwina uses them now to climb into the Range Rover. I like that kind of continuity, too: the melding of the old and the new.'  History, you see, is one of Gibb's passions. In fact that was what clinched his deal on the manor in the first place.  Mick Jagger saw it first, Dwina confides. He wanted it desperately. The then owner said no rock stars and their raucous parties, thank you very much. But Gibb wasn't prepared to give up. So impressive was his knowledge of the era and his love of the house's history that the owner accepted his offer. (He is now president of the Heritage Foundation.)  Inside is like a dimly lit Aladdin's cave: think Harry Potter meets medieval sorcery. Tapestries and tarot-card tiles adorn the walls, snarling stone griffins guard the doorway, suits of armour stand in the stairway, Buddhas beckon you into the great hall, which is stuffed with mystic artifacts that festoon the ornate, 16th-century wood panelling. Cheek by jowl, without a hint of embarrassment, sits the 21st century: DVDs of Men Behaving Badly, The Cinder Path and Eddie Murphy movies.  Houses are very important to Gibb. So much so that the title of his forthcoming solo album is '50 St Catherine's Drive', the address of one of the Gibb family's earliest homes on the Isle of Man. Then, the brothers, who were to go on to have more than 50 Top 10 hits worldwide and define disco, didn't - as Gibb says matter of factly - 'have a pot to piss in'.  He went back recently to view the two-up, two-down terrace house of which the family could afford to furnish only one floor. 'It seemed so small, as though it had shrunk,' he says. 'The old school building opposite was still there. That's my earliest memory, standing in my cot at night looking out of the window and that was the view.'  Yet Gibb couldn't bring himself to go inside. 'I didn't want to, I was nervous about seeing it again,' he says self-consciously, fiddling with | Question: Although mostly associated with Manchester in which other part of the UK were the Gibb Brothers born?", ['isle of man'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5573'), ("Context: Castle of Otranto, The (unabridged) – Naxos AudioBooksCastle of Otranto, The  (unabridged) – Naxos AudioBooks  The Castle of Otranto (unabridged)  Booklet Notes  Horace Walpole was born in 1717, four years before his father, Sir Robert Walpole, became Prime Minister.

In 1785, Walpole published Hieroglyphic Tales.  Walpole wrote The Castle of Otranto between June and August of 1764. He tried to pass it off as an actual translation, from the original Italian, of a medieval text written by ‘Onuphrio Muralto’. The first edition of five hundred copies soon sold out, and Walpole admitted, in the second edition published the following year, that the work was his own. The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.  The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.  Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.  We are going to be free  David Owen  The party\'s proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.  Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".  The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.  Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.  "We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.  He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.  The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot.  The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.  But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.  Social Democratic Party (UK)The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom.   The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party \'moderates\', dubbed the  \'Gang of Four\':  Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration.  Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election.  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community.  They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.  For the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats,  although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.  History  Origins  The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission.

He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

Alexander Hamilton  Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.  He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation\'s financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and "The New York Post" newspaper.  As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration.  He took the lead in the funding of the states\' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain.  His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military.  This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party.  They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy.

He is also the former owner of the Messenger Group.   Early life  Eddy Shah was born in Cambridge. His mother was English and his father was Iranian. Shah was educated at the Scottish co-educational independent boarding school of Gordonstoun, and at both Haywards Heath Grammar School and Haywards Heath Secondary Modern School, at Haywards Heath in Sussex. He then attended a Brighton crammer, where he obtained seven GCE \'O\' Levels.  Shah held various jobs, amongst which was floor manager for Granada\'s television studio. After he was fired from the Manchester Evening News, he decided to launch into newspaper publishing on his own and started with the proceeds of £14,000 from the sale of his first home, in Sale, which he had bought for £4,000. reprinted by TMCnet  Publisher  As the owner of six local newspapers, Shah employed anti-trade union laws introduced by the Thatcher governments to defeat the print unions after national strikes that went on for seven months – despite receiving death threats. He was the first person to invoke Margaret Thatcher\'s anti-union laws to force the unions to the bargaining table. The Wapping dispute followed three years later.  Shah first confronted the trade unions at his Warrington print works and the Manchester news offices in 1983. As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.   In 1986 he launched the Today, British newspaper.  Shah sold his newspapers in 1988 and setup an independent TV company.  Current business activities  Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels, including the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, Royal Wootton Bassett. He has recently built 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire Golf club.  Author  Shah is the author of several novels including The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994). After a break from writing, he returned in 2008 with a thriller entitled Second World.  Views on underage sex  In October 2012, he was charged with child sex offences allegedly committed in the 1990s. In December 2012, he denied six counts of rape involving a girl under 16.  The trial started at the Old Bailey on Tuesday 7 May 2013.  On 12 July he was found not guilty.  In August 2013, he said that girls who throw themselves at celebrities or who "go out and just have a good time" could themselves be to blame. In such cases, charges involving girls under the age of consent could just be a technicality. His comments drew strong criticism from the National Association of People Abused in Childhood, who said that rape was always a crime and the law was configured on the assumption that adults would want to protect children.

They have been manufactured by Fox\'s Confectionery in Leicester since 1918. The mints were developed by Eric Fox, one of the original founders of Fox\'s Confectionery. Since 1922 the mints have been sold with the Peppy the polar bear icon. Peppy is typically depicted as though standing on one of the mints. Glacier Mints resemble miniature blocks of ice and are clear and translucent. Companion products are Fox\'s Glacier Fruits and Fox\'s Glacier Dark.  There is no connection with Fox Glacier in New Zealand.  On Impulse - Packaging TodayOn Impulse - Packaging Today  On Impulse  4 December 2002  Competition in the confectionery market has reached boiling point and is forcing the big brands to provide added value to their products and the packaging in which they come. Today, the impulse purchase sector and promotions play a far more significant role in developing brand loyalty. Rodney Abbott  reports  Do you remember those happy carefree childhood days when you spent your hard-saved pennies or shillings on sweets at the corner shop? I do and I am going back over half a century – which is why I refer to pennies and shillings. Even then the shopkeeper\'s display was sufficiently expansive to keep my mind occupied for several minutes before I could make up my mind exactly what I wanted to buy.  Today, supermarkets and specialist confectioners, even confectionists tobaconistsand news agents, offer a mind boggling array of products that makes it almost impossible to finalise a choice without undertaking an inventory. The battle for brand supremacy is fierce and the confectionery supplier has to find increasingly innovative and cost-effective pack and marketing concepts to move products off the shelf.  According to market analysts Nielsen, the sugar confectionery market [mints, fruits, gums, traditional sweets etc.] is worth £1036M. The mint market alone is worth £146M and the fruits market is worth a massive £378M. Both of those markets have been growing at 1% and 4%, respectively, over the last year.  I sought timely refuge at one of the most British of confectionery suppliers – Leicester-based Fox\'s – which is so proud of its 105-year old heritage.  Mind you, the company has seen some changes in it\'s history, having been taken over by Rowntree, Nestlé and, more recently, Northern Foods which has just acquired Paynes – renown for its Poppets and Just Brazils.  Since the arrival of Northern Foods, the company has not let the grass grow under its feet.  Since the start of the year, it has put Fox\'s back on TV and undertaken various on pack promotions. Last month, it relaunched the brand in a bid to take it forward.  I asked brand manager Emma Gilbert to explain the reasoning behind the relaunch, which was preceded by careful market research with small but focused consumer groups through packaging designers Siebert Head.  "Loyal consumers – adults aged 35 and above – allied Fox\'s with Glacier Mints, a strong brand name. While they recognised the mint as a quality product, they didn\'t think that the former packaging reflected that quality and heritage of the brand.  "In fact, the research disclosed that the three basic elements of the branding were almost disjointed, all fighting for the consumer\'s attention. Above the image of Peppy the famous polar bear was the brand Fox\'s. Below Peppy were the words Glacier Mints. While the image of Peppy was regarded as important, even more key was the brand name \'Fox\'s\'."  Fox\'s Glacier Fruits were less well known than the mint, even though the brand has been around since the middle 50s and consumers were saying that they wanted added value from the fruits.

Plot summary  Receiving a tip from his dentist Jack Shorter, Inspector Peter Pascoe takes a closer look at the Calliope Kinema Club, a film club notorious for showing adult entertainment movies. Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn\'t suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter\'s concerns are unnecessary. Meanwhile, the "Calli" has been vandalised and its proprietor Gilbert Haggard has been assaulted so badly that he succumbs to a heart attack. The only existing copy of "Droit de Seigneur" - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed, and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her (yet unborn) child, it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the "Calli".  Publication history  *1978, London: Collins Crime Club ISBN 0-00-231643-9, Pub date February 1978, Hardback  Television Adaptation  The novel was adapted for television in 1994 and starred Gareth Hale as Dalziel and Norman Pace as Pascoe. It was shown on the ITV network in three parts over consecutive Saturdays beginning on 9 April. However, Reginald Hill is said to have been unhappy with the series and it subsequently remains the only one to star Hale and Pace in the leading roles. Dalziel and Pascoe was later picked up by the BBC where it enjoyed greater success. Since 1996, 11 series of Dalziel and Pascoe starring Warren Clarke and Colin Buchanan have been made up to 2007.

Subaru cars are known for the use of a boxer engine layout in most vehicles above 1500\xa0cc. Most Subaru models have used the Symmetrical All Wheel Drive drive-train layout since 1972. The flat/boxer engine and all-wheel-drive became standard equipment for mid-size and smaller cars in most international markets by 1996, and is now standard in most North American market Subaru vehicles. The lone exception is the BRZ, introduced in 2012, which uses the boxer engine but instead uses a rear-wheel-drive structure. Subaru also offers turbocharged versions of their passenger cars, such as the Impreza WRX and the Legacy 2.5GT. The 2.5XT trims of the Outback and Forester also include a turbocharged engine.  In Western markets, the Subaru brand has traditionally been popular among a dedicated core of buyers. Marketing is targeted towards a specific niche centered on those who desire the company\'s signature drive train.   Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or "The Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create FHI.   History  Fuji Heavy Industries started out as The Aircraft Research Laboratory in 1915, headed by Chikuhei Nakajima. In 1932, the company was reorganized as Nakajima Aircraft Company, Ltd and soon became a major manufacturer of aircraft for Japan during World War II. At the end of the Second World War Nakajima Aircraft was again reorganized, this time as Fuji Sangyo Co, Ltd. In 1946, the company created the Fuji Rabbit motor scooter with spare aircraft parts from the war.  In 1950, Fuji Sangyo was divided into 12 smaller corporations according to the Japanese Government\'s 1950 Corporate Credit Rearrangement Act, anti-zaibatsu legislation. Between 1953 and 1955, four of these corporations and a newly formed corporation decided to merge to form Fuji Heavy Industries. These companies were: Fuji Kogyo, a scooter manufacturer; coachbuilders Fuji Jidosha; engine manufacturers Omiya Fuji Kogyo; chassis builders Utsunomiya Sharyo and the Tokyo Fuji Dangyo trading company.   Kenji Kita, CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries at the time, wanted the new company to be involved in car manufacturing and soon began plans for building a car with the development code-name P-1. Mr. Kita canvassed the Company for suggestions about naming the P1, but none of the proposals was appealing enough. In the end he gave the car a Japanese name that he had "been cherishing in his heart": Subaru, which is the name of the Pleiades star cluster in Japanese. The first Subaru car was named the Subaru 1500.  Only twenty P1s were manufactured owing to multiple supply issues. From 1954 to 2008 the company designed and manufactured dozens of vehicles including the 1500 (1954), the tiny air-cooled 360 (1958), the Sambar (1961), the 1000 (which saw the introduction of the Subaru boxer engine in 1965), the R-2 (1969), the Rex and the Leone (1971), the BRAT (1978), Alcyone (1985), the Legacy (1989), the Impreza (1993), the Forester (1997), the Tribeca (2005), the Exiga (2008), and the BRZ (2012).  Major shareholders  Nissan acquired a 20.4% stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru\'s parent company, in 1968 during a period of government-ordered merging of the Japanese auto industry in order to improve competitiveness under the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato. Nissan would utilize FHI\'s bus manufacturing capability and expertise for their Nissan Diesel line of buses. In turn many Subaru vehicles, even today, use parts from the Nissan manufacturing keiretsu. The Subaru automatic transmission, known as the 4EAT, is also used in the first generation Nissan Pathfinder.  Upon Nissan\'s acquisition by Renault, its stake in FHI was sold to General Motors | Question: How many cross-stars feature in the Subaru automotive badge logo?', ['six'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2280'), ('Context: County MayoCounty Mayo (, meaning "Plain of the yew trees") is a county in Ireland.  In the West of Ireland, it is part of the province of Connacht and is named after the village of Mayo, now generally known as Mayo Abbey. Mayo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 130,638 at the 2011 census.   The boundaries of the county, which was formed in 1585, reflect the Mac William Íochtar lordship at that time.  Geography  It is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the south by County Galway; the east by County Roscommon; and the northeast by County Sligo. Mayo is the third-largest of Ireland\'s 32 counties in area and 15th largest in terms of population.  It is the second-largest of Connacht’s five counties in both size and population.  There is a distinct geological difference between the west and the east of the county.  The west consists largely of poor subsoils and is covered with large areas of extensive Atlantic blanket bog, whereas the east is largely a limestone landscape.  Agricultural land is therefore more productive in the east than in the west.  *The highest point in Mayo (and Connacht) is Mweelrea, at 814 m  *The River Moy in the northeast of the county is renowned for its salmon fishing  *Ireland\'s largest island, Achill Island, lies off Mayo\'s west coast  *Mayo has Ireland\'s highest cliffs at Croaghaun, Achill Island,  while the Benwee Head cliffs in Kilcommon Erris drop almost perpendicularly 900 ft into the Atlantic Ocean.   )  *The northwest areas of County Mayo have some of the best renewable energy resources in Europe, if not the world, in terms of wind resources, ocean wave, tidal and hydroelectric resources     Local government and political subdivisions  Mayo County Council () is the authority responsible for local government.  As a county council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. The County is divided into four municipal areas Castlebar, Ballina, Claremorris and West (an area which stretches from Westport to Belmullet). The council is responsible for housing and community, roads and transportation, urban planning and development, amenity and culture, and environment. For the purpose of local elections the county is divided into its four municipal districts, replacing the former six local electoral areas: Ballina (6), Belmullet (4), Castlebar (7), Claremorris (6), Swinford (4) and Westport (4).

It pitted then World Heavyweight Champion George Foreman against former champion and #1 contender Muhammad Ali , who became the second fighter ever, after Floyd Patterson , to regain the World Heavyweight Championship.  The event was Don King \'s first big venture as a boxing promoter. He managed to get both Ali and Foreman to agree to let him promote the fight if he could get them $5 million each. However, King did not have the money, so he began looking for an outside country to sponsor the event. Zaire\'s flamboyant president, Mobutu Sese Seko, asked for the fight to be held in his country, eager for the publicity such a high-profile event would bring.  The fight was shown on closed-circuit television at about 450 locations in the United States and Canada and was seen in roughly 100 countries worldwide. The fight was scheduled to start at 4:00 a.m. in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the United States.  Build up to the Fight  Ali was stripped of the World Heavyweight Championship and suspended from boxing for three and a half years following his refusal to enter the U.S. Army in 1967. He was able to regain a boxing license in 1970 and promptly fought two comeback fights, against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena . The following year, Ali fought Joe Frazier for the World Heavyweight Championship in a bout dubbed the Fight of the Century , which Frazier won by a unanimous decision. Over the next three years, Ali stayed active against other contenders while he campaigned for another title shot.  Foreman had quickly risen from his gold medal victory at the 1968 Olympics and into the top ranks of professional heavyweights. Although considered by many to be somewhat slow and clumsy, Foreman was greatly feared for his punching power, size, and sheer physical dominance. Still, Joe Frazier and his handlers believed that despite Foreman\'s ever growing list of knockout victories, he would be too slow and unrefined to stand up to Frazier\'s relentless attacks. This would turn out to be a grave miscalculation, as Foreman, a 3½ to 1 underdog, won the championship in grand fashion by knocking Frazier down six times in two rounds before the bout was stopped. Foreman further solidified his hold over the heavyweight division with a second-round destruction of Ken Norton , who was the only man besides Frazier (at that point in time) to defeat Ali (breaking Ali\'s jaw in the process).  By the time Ali and Foreman met, Ali had avenged his losses to both Norton and Frazier, but Foreman was an overwhelming favorite against a slowing and aging Ali.  Foreman and Ali spent much of the summer of 1974 training in Zaire and getting their bodies used to the weather in the tropical African country. The fight was originally set to happen on September 24, but the fight was postponed after Foreman was cut during training. It was rescheduled for October 30.  Ali was a very endearing figure to the people of Zaire and his mind games played out well, turning the Congolese people in his favor and against Foreman. A popular chant leading up to, and during the fight, was "Ali bomaye!," which means "Ali, kill him!"  The Rumble  Insiders say that Foreman and his handlers actually prayed in his dressing room before the fight that Foreman would not kill Ali, so high was the anticipation that Ali was simply no match for Foreman.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards. A giant picture of Francis stooping to head the ball remains on display in the main entrance and reception area of Forest's City Ground stadium | Question: Which manager bought Trevor Francis thereby turning him into the first million pound footballer ?", ['brian clough'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7153'), ('Context: Army Game, The - Nostalgia CentralArmy Game, The  Army Game, The  1 9 5 7 - 1 9 6 1\xa0(UK)  157 x 30 minute episodes  Debuting on ITV in 1957,\xa0The Army Game\xa0was British comedy at its best, very much in the style of\xa0Carry On\xa0films which were to start the following year (Indeed some of the\xa0Army Game\xa0cast developed into\xa0Carry On\xa0regulars).  William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)  In 1960, Alfie Bass and Bill Fraser marched their beloved characters into civvy street for\xa0 Bootsie and Snudge .

The blog touched on his final cricketing home a few months ago whilst exploring the route of the Little Quaggy in Mottingham and, with the centenary of his death approaching, it seem apposite to spend some time exploring the ‘swansong’ of his career in SE London.  Grace played his final Test in 1899 and severed his almost career long relationship with Gloucestershire the same year; the reason for the latter was that he had accepted an offer from the Crystal Palace Company to set up a new county team, the London County Club – Grace was secretary, manager and club captain of the new County club. He was given an annual salary of £600, probably very well paid for the time, and worth around £58,000 at 2015 prices , so quite moderate compared to the earnings of the current cricketing elite.  Grace was already 51 when the 1900 season started. The matches played by London County were given ‘first class’ status but were not part of the County Championship which had started ten years earlier – Grace had opened the batting with his brother Edward in the very first County Championship match against Yorkshire. The lack of involvement in the County Championship meant that Grace was able to attract various leading lights of the days to play for London County in what were effectively exhibition matches, whilst they retained their attachment to their counties. Notably amongst these was CB Fry, who retained his link to Sussex.  WG Grace in London County colours – source Wikimedia Commons  The County had an inauspicious start losing to Surrey at the Oval by an innings in mid April 1900. The first home match at Crystal Palace was a draw against the same opposition three weeks later, both were the cricketing equivalents of pre-season friendlies.. The club played another eleven first class matches that initial season – although almost half were against teams other that counties – such as the Oxbridge Universities and the M.C.C.  Grace was the club’s big attraction though and he still averaged 37.09 with the bat in 1902 , scoring 1187 runs; but as Grace’s form deteriorated with age, so did attendances and the London County lost its First Class status in 1904 and while it survived for another few seasons it folded in 1908.  One of Grace’s biographers, Robert Low , noted that  In truth, London County was never the serious cricketing project its backers had envisaged but more of a jolly swansong for the Champion in his twilight years.  The cricket ground was located roughly where the decaying 1970s athletics stadium is now located. It was also used for FA Cup finals, the 1905 final being the only surviving panorama picture ( below ) of the stadium. The stadium was taken over by Cristal Palace football club in 1905 who remained there until the park was requisitioned by the military in WW1, and slightly later by a speedway team that was later to become New Cross Rangers ( covered in the blog in 2014) .  Whilst at Crystal Palace, Grace was also involved with lawn bowls persuading the Crystal Palace Company to turn some of the tennis courts into bowling greens and was instrumental in creating England’s first indoor bowling green under the glass within the Crystal Palace. He was also involved in some of the early internationals and governance of the sport.  Whilst playing for London County Grace lived in nearby Sydenham at 7 Lawrie Park Road, a house called St Andrews. \xa0The house is no longer there is a new development there with a maroon plaque and the roads either side are named Cricketers Walk and Doctors Close.

Plot summary  Receiving a tip from his dentist Jack Shorter, Inspector Peter Pascoe takes a closer look at the Calliope Kinema Club, a film club notorious for showing adult entertainment movies. Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn\'t suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter\'s concerns are unnecessary. Meanwhile, the "Calli" has been vandalised and its proprietor Gilbert Haggard has been assaulted so badly that he succumbs to a heart attack. The only existing copy of "Droit de Seigneur" - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed, and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her (yet unborn) child, it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the "Calli".

He then attended a Brighton crammer, where he obtained seven GCE \'O\' Levels.  Shah held various jobs, amongst which was floor manager for Granada\'s television studio. After he was fired from the Manchester Evening News, he decided to launch into newspaper publishing on his own and started with the proceeds of £14,000 from the sale of his first home, in Sale, which he had bought for £4,000. reprinted by TMCnet  Publisher  As the owner of six local newspapers, Shah employed anti-trade union laws introduced by the Thatcher governments to defeat the print unions after national strikes that went on for seven months – despite receiving death threats. He was the first person to invoke Margaret Thatcher\'s anti-union laws to force the unions to the bargaining table. The Wapping dispute followed three years later.  Shah first confronted the trade unions at his Warrington print works and the Manchester news offices in 1983. As the owner of the Warrington Messenger, he sacked six workers in a declared anti-union move. In response, the National Graphical Association (NGA) began mass picketing of the Messengers offices.  On 30 November, over four thousand trade unionists attended a mass picket. The police brought in riot-trained Police Support Units from five surrounding areas and, after some pushing and shoving, the confrontation became physical. The NGA speaker van was attacked and overturned by police, while squads with full riot gear repeatedly charged the pickets. The National Graphical Association immediately suspended mass picketing. For the first time in post-war Britain, para-military policing more akin to that used in Northern Ireland had been used to attack strikers in an industrial dispute.

He soon hooked up with Alison Moyet , an R&B singer with a powerful deep alto, and started recording as Yazoo . (In the U.S., after the blues record label Yazoo sued them, they were known as Yaz.) The first Yazoo single, "Only You" b/w "Situation," was a double-sided smash, and their debut, Upstairs at Eric\'s (named after Mute Records\' head Eric Radcliffe) went gold in the U.K. After they finished recording their second album, You and Me Both, Clarke opted out of the group.

There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along. The sound on the set is a bit muddy, but the duo\'s enthusiastic performance more than makes up for the sonic limitations. ~ j. poet  Reconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusicReconnected: Live - Yazoo | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic  Reconnected: Live  google+  AllMusic Review                             by j. poet  In the early \'80s, Vince Clarke quit Depeche Mode , allegedly dissatisfied with their move toward pop music.

Achilles was a famous Greek warrior whose mother was one of the immortals, but he was not. His mother sought to protect her son by dipping him in the River Styx, which was believed to have magical powers. She held her infant son by his heel. Consequently, the only part of his body that was vulnerable was his heel. As fate would have it, at the battle of Troy, an enemy warrior, Paris, shot an arrow into Achilles heel and killed him. The phrase “Achilles heel” has come into common usage to describe someone’s personal weakness or vulnerability.\xa0  AchillesIn Greek mythology, Achilles (; , Akhilleus,) was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and greatest warrior of Homer\'s Iliad. His mother was the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons.  Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term Achilles\' heel has come to mean a person\'s point of weakness.  Etymology   Achilles\' name can be analyzed as a combination of  (\') "grief" and  (\') "a people, tribe, nation." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles\' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of  \' ("glory", usually glory in war).  Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy,  following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.  R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name.   The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.  It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía) attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".  Birth   Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.   There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in Argonautica (iv.760) Zeus\' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.

As a first step toward establishing a long-term manned platform in space, Skylab made use of a Saturn V Moon rocket, whose third stage was outfitted with two decks as a habitat and ready-to-use orbital workshop, and the command and service modules of Apollo spacecraft, which ferried the station’s crews and small amounts of supplies. Skylab was 30.2 metres (99 feet) in length and 6.7 metres (22 feet) in diameter and had a mass of about 75,000 kg (165,000 pounds). Although limited by its consumable resources in the same way as the Soviet Union’s first-generation Salyut stations, Skylab was much roomier and capable of more research.

Skylab hosted two additional three-man crews for missions lasting 59 and 84 days. Each of the three Skylab missions set a new space endurance record. Although plans called for Skylab to be used again with one of the first space shuttle missions boosting it to a higher orbit, increased solar activity caused its orbit to degrade faster than expected.

The move is because Britons find it difficult to spread jam on its curved shape.  Harry Jones, the croissant buyer for Tesco said, "After demand for crescent shaped croissants started falling, we spoke to our customers and nearly 75 per cent of them told us that they preferred straight ones. At the heart of the move away from curved croissants is the spreadability factor."  Tesco currently sells about one million of its own-label curved croissants every week. Hence, to keep up with the demand, the supermarket has said that it will instead start selling only straight croissants going forward.  "The majority of shoppers find it easier to spread jam, or their preferred filling, on a straighter shape with a single sweeping motion. With the crescent shaped croissants, it\'s more fiddly and most people can take up to three attempts to achieve perfect coverage, which increases the potential for accidents involving sticky fingers and tables," Jones added.  While the recipe for these new pastries that Tesco is set to introduce will continue to use butter, the Welwyn Garden City-headquartered chain said that this move was part of a wider range of improvements it was adopting at its bakery division. Some of the other changes include adding more chocolate chips in its own brand brioche and adding creamier ganache in its chocolate cakes.  Other UK supermarkets such as Sainsbury\'s and Waitrose, however, have said that they had no such plans to discontinue curved croissants and that they will be sold alongside their straight ones. "The easiest way to enjoy a curved croissant is to do it the French way – by dunking it into a dollop of jam," a spokeswoman for Waitrose said.

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs. Most cleaning attempts merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

It is among the world\'s most recognizable aircraft, [1] and was the first wide-body ever produced. Manufactured by Boeing\'s Commercial Airplane unit in the United States, the original version of the 747 was two and a half times the size of the Boeing 707, [2] one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s. First flown commercially in 1970, the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years. [3]  The four-engine 747 uses a double deck configuration for part of its length. It is available in passenger, freighter and other versions. Boeing designed the 747\'s hump-like upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or (as is the general rule today) extra seating, and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door. Boeing did so because the company expected supersonic airliners (whose development was announced in the early 1960s) to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete, while believing that the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust into the future. [4] The 747 in particular was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold, [5] but it exceeded its critics\' expectations with production passing the 1,000 mark in 1993. [6] By December 2011, 1,427 aircraft had been built, with 97 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order. [7]  The 747-400 , the most common passenger version in service, is among the fastest airliners in service with a high-subsonic cruise speed of Mach 0.85–0.855 (up to 570mph/805km/h. It has an intercontinental range of 7,260 nautical miles (8,350 mi or 13,450 km). [8] The 747-400 passenger version can accommodate 416 passengers in a typical three-class layout, 524 passengers in a typical two-class layout, or 660 passengers in a high density one-class configuration. [9] The newest version of the aircraft, the 747-8, is in production and received certification in 2011. Deliveries of the 747-8F freighter version to the launch customer Cargolux began in October 2011; the 747-8I passenger version is to follow in 2012. The 747 is to be replaced by the Boeing Y3 (part of the Boeing Yellowstone Project) in the future.

Although the C-141 Starlifter was being introduced, they felt that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft.

First reference:  Friedrich Nietzsche was a German philosopher who is sometimes referenced on Heroes .  Contents  4 Notes  About  Friedrich Nietzsche, born in 1844 was a philosopher who wrote about religion, morality, culture, philosophy, and science. Some of his main assertions include tragedy as validation of life, an eternal return, and a rejection of Christianity, democracy, and socialism. Between 1883 and 1885, Nietzsche wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra , which in part deals with the idea of the "prophecy" of the Übermensch . Thus Spoke Zarathustra contends that "man is something which ought to be overcome", and posits that the Übermensch is the goal that humanity should set for itself. The Übermensch is sometimes translated as "overman", "superman", or "superhuman".  Nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown in 1890 and died in 1900.  References  Heroes Evolutions  In chapter 6 of Slow Burn , Josh asks Draph what he\'s been up to, and if he\'s still trying to save the world. Draph says that he is working on his dissertation about Nietzsche\'s Overman theory. Even though Draph says that Josh would like it, Josh says he doesn\'t want to be a lab rat.

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a nineteenth-century German philosopher. He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, using a distinctive German language style and displaying a fondness for aphorism. Nietzsche\'s influence remains substantial within and beyond philosophy, notably in existentialism and postmodernism.  Thus Spake Zarathustra (Also sprach Zarathustra), is a work composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same", the parable on the "death of God", and the "prophecy" of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science. Described by Nietzsche himself as "the deepest ever written", the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.

Page 1  » Further Viewing: Videos  Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900 CE) wrote Thus Spake Zarathustra, a book through which many Europeans became familiar with the name Zarathushtra. Nietzsche\'s work is known more by how it was misinterpreted than by a careful examination of his life and writings. In Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche developed the concept of the ï¿½bermensch or overman, a word incorrectly translated into English as the superman. Born in Rocken, Germany, the son of a Polish Lutheran minister and a German mother, Nietzsche declared there was nothing German about him. He intensely disliked Imperial Germany and the growing German nationalism of his day. Yet Nietzsche would be quoted years after his death to justify German Nazi ideology.

The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.  The series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the "English Riviera". The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.  In a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time.  Origins  In May 1970 the Monty Python team stayed at the Gleneagles Hotel (which is referred to in "The Builders" episode) in Torquay whilst filming on location.  John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, Donald Sinclair, whom Cleese later described as "the rudest man I\'ve ever come across in my life."   This behaviour included Sinclair throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive; and placing Eric Idle\'s briefcase (put to one side by Idle while waiting for a car with Cleese) behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (Sinclair explained his actions by claiming the hotel had \'staff problems\').  He also criticised the American-born Terry Gilliam\'s table manners for not being "British" (that is, he switched hands with his fork whilst eating). Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming, furthering their research of the hotel owner. Cleese later played a hotel owner called Donald Sinclair in the 2001 movie Rat Race.  At the time, Cleese was a writer on the 1970s British TV sitcom Doctor in the House for London Weekend Television. An early prototype of the character that became known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third Doctor series (titled Doctor at Large). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by Timothy Bateson) with a domineering wife. The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.  Cleese parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, Video Arts.  Cleese said in 2008 that the first Fawlty Towers script, written with then-wife Connie Booth, was rejected by the BBC. At a 30th-anniversary event honouring the show, Cleese said,  Cleese was paid £6,000 for 43 weeks\' work and supplemented his income by appearing in television advertisements.[http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2009/05/06/2782020-john-cleese-recalls-golden-age-of-fawlty-towers "John Cleese recalls golden age of \'Fawlty Towers\'"] Newsvine / Newsvine, 6 May 2009  Bill Cotton, the BBC\'s Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC\'s relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the programme get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.  Production  Although the series is set in Torquay in Devon, no part of it was shot in south west England. For the exterior filming, the Wooburn Grange Country Club in Buckinghamshire was used instead of a hotel.

Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8.

It is generally regarded as a classic of the spy thriller genre.  The Eagle Has Landed: Logline  During World War Two, a unit of German paratroopers and an Irish revolutionary infiltrate England to try to kidnap Churchill.

The major ones are blacked out like this secret . To view them, just select/highlight them.  In the prologue it’s the 1970s. Jack Higgins is researching a Norfolk churchyard for a magazine article. He discovers a mass grave with a headstone that says:  Here lies Lieutenant-Colonel Kurt Steiner and 13 German paratroopers, killed in action on the 6th November, 1943.  The vicar and the locals become angry when Higgins asks about the headstone, but he bribes one to tell him who Kurt Steiner was. He gets the answer, “He was the German lad who came here with his men to shoot Mr. Churchill…”  Now it’s 1943. Inspired by Otto Skorzeny’s daring rescue of Mussolini, Hitler has the idea of kidnapping British Prime Minister\xa0Winston Churchill.  Oberst\xa0Radl, examines the possibility.\xa0He thinks it’s impossible until he\xa0reads a report from a German spy, Joanna Grey, which says that Churchill plans to weekend near the\xa0Norfolk coast.  Radl devises a plan to drop a unit of Fallschirmjäger paratroopers into Norfolk. They will drop one night and kidnap Churchill the next. The German Navy will then extract them by boat.  As the Fallschirmjäger will be disguised as a unit of Polish paratroopers, they need an English-speaking officer to avoid arousing suspicion. Radl hears of a veteran Fallschirmjäger, Lieutenant Colonel\xa0Kurt Steiner, who\xa0speaks perfect English as he was brought up in London. But Steiner has\xa0been assigned to a penal unit, because he and his men tried to stop SS troops killing a Jewish girl in Warsaw. Now they are making suicide attacks on shipping in the English Channel. Radl has Steiner and his men reassigned to his command.  Radl also recruits an IRA member, Liam Devlin. Devlin \xa0infiltrates England, contacts Mrs. Grey and gets a job as a marsh warden. He also becomes romantically involved with a local girl, Molly Prior.  The local bully is jealous and tries to attack Molly, but Devlin defends her. Devlin also buys an army truck and a jeep on the black-market to transport Steiner and his men. The black-marketeers try to double cross Devlin and he shoots two of them. One dies of his wounds and this draws the attention of the Police Special Branch, who start searching for Devlin.  Steiner and his men parachute into Norfolk and are met by Devlin and Mrs. Grey. They spend the day in the village, having duped the locals.\xa0A child from the village falls into the mill race and is carried away by the current. One of Steiner’s men rescues her, but is crushed by the water wheel, revealing his German uniform. The villagers realise who the ‘Polish’ paratroopers really are…  Steiner’s men round up the locals, but one escapes and alerts a unit of the US Army camped nearby. The Americans make a foolhardy attack and are massacred by the battle-hardened Fallschirmjäger. More American troops arrive. Outnumbered, Steiner’s men make a last stand at the church.  Molly helps Steiner and Devlin escape from the church. Devlin heads to the coast to be picked up by the German navy, but stops at his cottage on the way. The Special Branch detectives are waiting, but he manages to shoot them. He wades out to sea, meets the ship and escapes.

(See Pearl Harbor Attack .) Pearl Harbor centres on a cloverleaf-shaped, artificially improved harbour on the southern coast of Oahu , 6 miles (10 km) west of Honolulu. The harbour is virtually surrounded (west to east) by the cities of Ewa, Waipahu, Pearl City, Aiea, and Honolulu. It has 10 square miles (26 square km) of navigable water and hundreds of anchorages and covers a land area of more than 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares). Its four lochs are formed by the Waipio and Pearl City peninsulas and Ford Island. Pearl Harbor Entrance (channel) connects its virtually landlocked bay with the Pacific Ocean .  Pearl Harbor was called Wai Momi (“Pearl Waters”) by the Hawaiians because of the pearl oysters that once grew there. In 1840 Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy made the first geodetic survey and urged the dredging of the coral-bar entrance to the harbour. About 30 years later Colonel John McAllister Schofield further recommended that the United States secure harbour rights. A subsequent treaty (1887) granted the United States the exclusive use of the harbour as a coaling and repair station, but work was not begun until after 1898, when the Spanish-American War indicated its strategic value as a Pacific base. A naval station was established after 1908, and a drydock was completed in 1919.  During the Pearl Harbor Attack in 1941 the USS Arizona sank with a loss of more than 1,100 men; a white concrete and steel structure now spans the hull of the sunken ship, which was dedicated as a national memorial on May 30, 1962. Present facilities at Pearl Harbor include a naval shipyard, supply centre, and submarine base. The naval supply centre is on Pearl City Peninsula.

Beginning in the first half of the 19th century, Pearl Harbor was identified as possible location for a naval base by the United States, Great Britain, and France. Its desirability was reduced however by the shallow water and reefs that blocked its narrow entrance. This restriction led to it largely being overlooked in favor of other locations in the islands.  US Annexation:  In 1873, the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce petitioned King Lunalilo to negotiate a reciprocal treaty with the United States to further the bond between the two nations. As an inducement, the King offered the cessation of Pearl Harbor to the United States. This element of the proposed treaty was dropped when it became clear the Lunalilo\'s legislature would not approve the treaty with it included.  The Reciprocity Treaty was ultimately concluded in 1875, by Lunalilo\'s successor, King Kalakaua. Pleased by the treaty\'s economic benefits, the King soon sought to extend the treaty beyond its term of seven years.  The effort to renew the treaty met with resistance in the United States. After several years of negotiation, the two nations agreed to renew the treaty through the Hawaii-United States Convention of 1884.

The Loire river actually reaches a huge surface of France, draining more than a fifth of France's territory.  Loire river rises in the Cevennes in the Ardeche department at an altitude of about 1300m. The Loire then flows for more than 1000km slightly north through Orleans and then west through cities like Tours or Nantes until it eventually reaches the Bay of Biscay at Saint Nazaire.  The major tributaries of the Loire river are the Maine, the Nievre, the Allier, the Cher or the Indre. The Loire river has given name to six french departments, including Haute-Loire or Loire-Atlantique for example. That shows how big of a part it takes in France territory.  Finally, the Loire river is famous for its beautiful surroundings, refered as the Loire Valley, now belonging to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. This area is renowned for its amazing castles and vineyards.  Loire River Geography  The Loire river first originates in the Ardeche department, at the three springs of the Mont Gerbier de Jonc. Due to its important size, changes in the Loire river water level have caused important floodings in the past, especially in 1911 for the last century, when the damages caused by the flooding were quite important.  One of the characteristics of the Loire river is that there are very few dams and locks compared to some other rivers of that size in Europe. Therefore, the natural flow of the Loire river is more preserved than for some other rivers. However, the Villerest dam that has been built in 1985 just a bit south to Roanne has helped preventing a flooding.  Loire River Navigation  The Loire river has been used and considered for over 2000 years as the main way of transport in France. It has been used for any kind of uses, whether it was commercial, as a way of transport or as a way of moving military troops. Due to its central location and to its length, it has been and still is a bit nowadays broadly used. However, since the coming of the railway in the 19th century it has been less and less used as a transport way.  There has been several locks open and closed over time, as the Loire river used to be way more used before as it is now. Additional canals such as the Canal de Roanne a Digoin were opened and closed as well, as it allowed people to navigate further up the Loire valley to Digoin, but went on to be useless when the railworks and roads developped.  \xa0\xa0\xa0  LoireThe Loire (; ; ) is the longest river in France.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346549/Loire-River The Loire], Encyclopædia Britannica on-line With a length of 1012 km, it drains an area of 117054 km2, or more than a fifth of France's land area,  and is the 171st longest river in the world.  It rises in the highlands of the southeastern quarter of the Massif Central in the Cévennes range (in the department of Ardèche) at 1350 m near Mont Gerbier de Jonc; it flows north for over 1000 km through Nevers to Orléans, then west through Tours and Nantes until it reaches the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic Ocean) at St Nazaire. Its main tributaries include the rivers Nièvre, Maine and the Erdre on its right bank, and the rivers Allier, Cher, Indre, Vienne, and the Sèvre Nantaise to the left bank.  The Loire gives its name to six departments: Loire, Haute-Loire, Loire-Atlantique, Indre-et-Loire, Maine-et-Loire, and Saône-et-Loire. The central part of the Loire Valley, located in the Centre region, was added to the World Heritage Sites list of UNESCO on December 2, 2000.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

Advertisement  Advertisement  Robert Langdon: the Inferno characterRobert Langdon: the Inferno character  Leave a comment Inferno's Personalities By Florence Inferno  Robert Langdon is a fictional character created by American author Dan Brown for his novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), and the bestseller Inferno (2013). Langdon is a Harvard University professor of Religious Iconology and Symbology.  Character development  Dan Brown created the character as a fictional alter ego of himself, or of “the man he wishes he could be.” Brown was born June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire. Likewise, the fictional Langdon is described as also having been born on June 22 in Exeter, and having attending the same school as Brown did, Phillips Exeter Academy.  Brown named the character after John Langdon, a professor of typography at Drexel University who is known for his creation of ambigrams, typographical designs that can be read in multiple ways; for example, right side up and upside down. An example of Langdon’s ambigrams appeared on the cover of the first edition of Angels & Demons.  Storyline  Little background detail is provided by Brown. In The Da Vinci Code, Langdon wears a turtleneck, a Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers, and does this to all events, ranging from lectures to social events. A frequently referred to accessory is his Mickey Mouse watch, a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. He drives an automatic Saab 900S.  Langdon was a diver at Phillips Exeter Academy in prep school and played water polo at Princeton University, where he went for college. He suffers from claustrophobia, the fear of enclosed spaces, stemming from the time he fell into a well when he was 7 years old. His father died when he was 12, and his new mentor father-figure became Peter Solomon, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  Known for his brilliant problem-solving mind and his genius, Langdon has an eidetic memory and an understanding of semiotics. As a professor at Harvard University, he teaches Religious Iconology and the fictional field of Symbology.

Overview  The skull is a bony structure found in many animals which serves as the general framework for the head . The skull supports the structures of the face and protects the head against injury.  The skull can be subdivided into two parts:  the cranium and the mandible. A skull that is missing a mandible is only a cranium; this is the source of a very commonly made error in terminology. Those animals having skulls are called craniates.  Protection of the brain is only one part of the function of a bony skull. For example, a fixed distance between the eyes is essential for stereoscopic vision , and a fixed position for the ears helps the brain to use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.  Human skulls  Human skull (front)  Human skull (side)  In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones . Except for the mandible , all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures , rigid articulations permitting very little movement.  Eight bones form the neurocranium (braincase), a protective vault surrounding the brain . Fourteen bones form the splanchnocranium, the bones supporting the face. Encased within the temporal bones are the six ear ossicles of the middle ears , though these are not part of the skull. The hyoid bone , supporting the tongue , is usually not considered as part of the skull either, as it does not articulate with any other bones.  The skull contains the sinus cavities , which are air-filled cavities lined with respiratory epithelium , which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are unclear; they may contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength,or they may be important in improving the resonance of the voice. In some animals, such as the elephant, the sinuses are extensive. The elephant skull needs to be very large, to form an attachment for muscles of the neck and trunk, but is also unexpectedly light; the comparatively small brain-case is surrounded by large sinuses which reduce the weight. The meninges are the three layers, or membranes, which surround the structures of the nervous system . They are known as the dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . Other than being classified together, they have little in common with each other.  In humans, the anatomical position for the skull is the Frankfurt plane , where the lower margins of the orbits and the upper borders of the ear canals are all in a horizontal plane. This is the position where the subject is standing and looking directly forward. For comparison, the skulls of other species, notably primates and hominids, may sometimes be studied in the Frankfurt plane. However, this does not always equate to a natural posture in life.  Possible types of skull fractures  Temporal Fenestra  This Massospondylus skull shows the two temporal fenestrae typical of diapsids .  The temporal fenestra are anatomical features of the amniote skull, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra is critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.  Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but the more advanced sauropsids and synapsids did. As time progressed, sauropsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. | Question: In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones, which are joined together by sutures, rigid articulations permitting very little movement, except for which one?", ['jaw'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2850'), ("Context: Now That 's What I Call Music or Now 1 is the first album from the popular Now ! series that was released in the United Kingdom in 1983 .

Although Delaware is the second smallest state in the United States, its population was approximately                            112,216 at the beginning of the war. Its size makes it a useful microcosm in understanding the divisiveness of the war.\xa0  \xa0  Factionalism, from abolitionism to secessionism, existed in Delaware, but                            many of its citizens did not align with either extreme. For example, there are three counties in Delaware. New Castle, which                            contains the city of Wilmington, was a center of trade, industry, and Republicanism. The two other counties, Kent and Sussex,                            were agricultural and generally pro-Southern. \xa0Thousands of men enlisted in the Union, but several hundred joined the                            Confederacy. Communities were divided, and Union troops had to patrol election polls to protect Republican voters.  \xa0  After the colonial period,the agricultural economy of the state began                            to shift from tobacco to mixed farming, which created less need for slave labor. In 1860, there were 1,789 slaves in the state                            and 19,829 free African Americans. Many slaves ran away during the war, and some elected to serve the Union. In 1863, 954                            African Americans joined the Union army, and handful of others served in the navy. However, many citizens of this state were                            not happy with the Emancipation Proclamation. In the 1864 election, they voted for George B. McClellan, the Democratic candidate. After the war, Delaware Democrats rejected the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments and                            worked to disenfranchise African Americans for several decades.  \xa0  Although Delaware was not a battlefield, the war did find its way                            into the First State. Fort Delaware became a prison for Confederate prisoners of war. The fortress was completed shortly before                            the war began and is located on Pea Patch Island. The fort earned a reputation for cruelty and the moniker “Andersonville                            of the North.” However, the death rate in Fort Delaware, which supported a prison population of over 30,000, was only                            7.6%. Most northern prisoners had a rate of twenty-one percent. See also: Sectionalism \xa0and\xa0 Causes of the American Civil War .

One of Kentucky’s                            more prominent nineteenth century Senators, Henry Clay, spent much of his career trying to compromise the issue of slavery                            before the war. His most well known efforts were in crafting the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the later Compromise of 1850.  \xa0  As clear from these most prominent residents, Kentucky was a state of divided loyalties and families torn apart. The state provided 90,000 troops                            to the Union and 35,000 to the Confederacy. Nowhere was this division more evident than in the "First Family." Several members                            of Mary Todd Lincoln\'s family fought for the South. Another family similarly divided was that of U.S. Senator John Crittenden,                            whose two sons were generals on opposite sides. Some historians even say that the ensuing family feuds, such as the Hatfields                            and the McCoys, carried on the war in Kentucky long after its official end.

After hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Vancouver, Canada, passed the Olympic flame to Sochi for the opening of the 2014 Winter Games. The next Winter Olympics are scheduled to take place in PyeongChang in the Republic of Korea in 2018.  2010 Winter OlympicsThe 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XXIes Jeux olympiques d\'hiver) and commonly known as Vancouver 2010, informally the 21st Winter Olympics, were a major international multi-sport event held from February 12 to 28, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands, and in the resort town of Whistler. Approximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC), headed by John Furlong. The 2010 Winter Olympics were the third Olympics hosted by Canada and the first by the province of British Columbia. Previously, Canada hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta.  Following Olympic tradition, then-Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan received the Olympic flag during the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The flag was raised on February 28, 2006, in a special ceremony and was on display at Vancouver City Hall until the Olympic opening ceremony. The event was officially opened by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, who was accompanied by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge.   For the first time, Canada won gold in an "official" sport at an Olympic Games hosted at home, having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary (although Canada won a gold medal in the demonstration sport of curling in Calgary). Canada clinched their first gold medal on the second day of the competition and first topped the gold medal tally on the second to last day of competition and went on to become the first host nation since Norway in 1952 to lead the gold medal count.  With 14, Canada broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics, which was 13, set by the former Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002. The United States won the most medals in total, their second time doing so at the Winter Olympics, and broke the record for the most medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 37, a record held up to then by Germany in 2002 with 36 medals. Athletes from Slovakia  and Belarus  won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations.  Bid and preparations  The Canadian Olympic Association chose Vancouver as the Canadian candidate city over Calgary, which sought to re-host the Games and Quebec City, which had lost the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995. On the first round of voting on November 21, 1998, Vancouver-Whistler had 26 votes, Quebec City had 25 and Calgary had 21. On December 3, 1998, the second and final round of voting occurred between the two leading contenders, which saw Vancouver win with 40 votes compared to Quebec City\'s 32 votes. Vancouver had also previously bid for the  1976 and  1980 games.  After the bribery scandal over the candidacy of the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics (which resulted in Quebec City asking for compensation (C$8 million) for its unsuccessful bid),  many of the rules of the bidding process were changed in 1999.

There are numerous myths and legends surrounding marine mammals. The Greeks believed that killing a dolphin was as bad as murdering a human. An Amazon legend said that river dolphins came to shore dressed as men to woo pretty girls during fiestas. During the Middle Ages, there were numerous legends surrounding the narwhals' amazing tusk, which was thought to have come from the unicorn.  Marine mammals evolved from their land dwelling ancestors over time by developing adaptations to life in the water. To aid swimming, the body has become streamlined and the number of body projections has been reduced. The ears have shrunk to small holes in size and shape. Mammary glands and sex organs are not part of the external physiology, and posterior (hind) limbs are no longer present.  Mechanisms to prevent heat loss have also been developed. The cylindrical body shape with small appendages reduces the surface area to volume ratio of the body, which reduces heat loss. Marine mammals also have a counter current heat exchange mechanism created by convergent evolution where the heat from the arteries is transferred to the veins as they pass each other before getting to extremities, thus reducing heat loss. Some marine mammals also have a thick layer of fur with a water repellent undercoat and/or a thick layer of blubber that can't be compressed. The blubber provides insulation, a food reserve, and aids with buoyancy. These heat loss adaptations can also lead to overheating for animals that spend time out of the water. To prevent overheating, seals or sea lions will swim close to the surface with their front flippers waving in the air. They also flick sand onto themselves to keep the sun from directly hitting their skin. Blood vessels can also be expanded to act as a sort of radiator.  One of the major behavioral adaptations of marine mammals is their ability to swim and dive. Pinnipeds swim by paddling their flippers while sirenians and cetaceans move their tails or flukes up and down.  Some marine mammals can swim at relatively high speeds. Sea lions swim up to 35 kph and orcas can reach 50 kph . The fastest marine mammal, however, is the common dolphin , which reaches speeds up to 64 kph . While swimming, these animals take very quick breaths. For example, fin whales can empty and refill their huge lungs in less than 2 seconds. During dives marine mammals' larynx and esophagus close automatically when they open their mouths to catch prey. Oxygen is stored in hemoglobin in the blood and in myoglobin in the muscles. The lungs are also collapsible so that air is pushed into the windpipe preventing excess nitrogen from being absorbed into the tissues. Decreasing pressure can cause excess nitrogen to expand in the tissues as animals ascend to shallower depths, which can lead to decompression sickness aka “the bends.” Bradycardia, the reduction of heart rate by 10 to 20%, also takes place to aid with slowing respiration during dives and the blood flow to non-essential body parts. These adaptations allow sea otters to stay submerged for 4 to 5 minutes and dive to depths up to 55 m . Pinnipeds can often stay down for 30 minutes and reach average depths of 150- 250 m . One marine mammal with exceptional diving skills is the Weddell seal , which can stay submerged for at least 73 minutes at a time at depths up to 600 m . The length and depth of whale dives depends on the species. Baleen whales feed on plankton near the surface of the water and have no need to dive deeply so they are rarely seen diving deeper than 100 m . Toothed whales seek larger prey at deeper depths and some can stay down for hours at depths of up to 2,250 m .  Marine mammals are often very social animals. Dolphins travel in pods (schools) and catch rides on the bow waves of boats.

Overview  The skull is a bony structure found in many animals which serves as the general framework for the head . The skull supports the structures of the face and protects the head against injury.  The skull can be subdivided into two parts:  the cranium and the mandible. A skull that is missing a mandible is only a cranium; this is the source of a very commonly made error in terminology. Those animals having skulls are called craniates.  Protection of the brain is only one part of the function of a bony skull. For example, a fixed distance between the eyes is essential for stereoscopic vision , and a fixed position for the ears helps the brain to use auditory cues to judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned ungulates); the frontal bone is where horns are mounted.  Human skulls  Human skull (front)  Human skull (side)  In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones . Except for the mandible , all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures , rigid articulations permitting very little movement.  Eight bones form the neurocranium (braincase), a protective vault surrounding the brain . Fourteen bones form the splanchnocranium, the bones supporting the face. Encased within the temporal bones are the six ear ossicles of the middle ears , though these are not part of the skull. The hyoid bone , supporting the tongue , is usually not considered as part of the skull either, as it does not articulate with any other bones.  The skull contains the sinus cavities , which are air-filled cavities lined with respiratory epithelium , which also lines the large airways. The exact functions of the sinuses are unclear; they may contribute to lessening the weight of the skull with a minimal reduction in strength,or they may be important in improving the resonance of the voice. In some animals, such as the elephant, the sinuses are extensive. The elephant skull needs to be very large, to form an attachment for muscles of the neck and trunk, but is also unexpectedly light; the comparatively small brain-case is surrounded by large sinuses which reduce the weight. The meninges are the three layers, or membranes, which surround the structures of the nervous system . They are known as the dura mater , the arachnoid mater and the pia mater . Other than being classified together, they have little in common with each other.  In humans, the anatomical position for the skull is the Frankfurt plane , where the lower margins of the orbits and the upper borders of the ear canals are all in a horizontal plane. This is the position where the subject is standing and looking directly forward. For comparison, the skulls of other species, notably primates and hominids, may sometimes be studied in the Frankfurt plane. However, this does not always equate to a natural posture in life.  Possible types of skull fractures  Temporal Fenestra  This Massospondylus skull shows the two temporal fenestrae typical of diapsids .  The temporal fenestra are anatomical features of the amniote skull, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the postorbital and squamosal bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the infratemporal fenestrae. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra is critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.  Physiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but the more advanced sauropsids and synapsids did. As time progressed, sauropsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are sauropsids, have large advanced openings and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. | Question: In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 22 bones, which are joined together by sutures, rigid articulations permitting very little movement, except for which one?", ['jaw'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2850'), ('Context: Amount of substance is a standards - defined quantity that measures the size of an ensemble of elementary entities , such as atoms , molecules , electrons , and other particles .

Appearances  Every Discworld book except The Wee Free Men  Death is the anthropomorphic personification of death on the Discworld . He appears as the traditional Grim Reaper, with a skeletal body, a black robe and a scythe (or sometimes a sword for royalty) and talks in unquoted small caps . Death appears for the first time in the first novel, The Colour of Magic (though it is suggested that his first appearance was actually that of his 'stand-in', Scrofula ), and reappears in all of the stories that take place in the Discworld universe, with the exception of The Wee Free Men , a Tiffany Aching young adult book, and Snuff .  Death is fascinated with humans in general, and as a result attempts to emulate their behaviour, if only to better understand them. However, as an immortal skeletal being who does not have to pay heed to fatigue or even time, he seems to lack comprehension of some human concepts, such as detective novels. He is also described by Susan as someone who would solve world hunger, not by changing socioeconomic forces, but by giving everyone a good meal. While his job and anatomy cause a lack of emotions which he displays in his hollow voice , Death can be quite passionate about life in general; in some cases, he actively defends it against the depredations of the Auditors .  Death is fundamentally incapable of forgetting anything, with the possible exceptions of 1) how the horse moves in chess, and 2) how to get drunk.  Death had an apprentice named Mort and an adopted daughter named Ysabell , who later got married and left him to become the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit . Sometimes he visits Susan Sto Helit , his granddaughter through them. When not out and about, Death lives alone in Death's Domain with his manservant Albert and, since the events of Reaper Man , the Death of Rats .  Also members of the household are the famed pale horse, named Binky , and at times Quoth the talking raven.  He is fond of kittens, Binky, Susan, Albert, curries and life (without which he would be useless). He strongly dislikes the Auditors , whose machinations against life he considers to be cheating, and at times has seemed to resent Rincewind 's unpunctuality, though at other times he has seemed more amiable toward him. Death occasionally finds it tiresome when his work entails dealing with irregularities, such as finding an appropriate posthumous destiny for Mr. Tulip or the repeated resurrections of Scraps .  Nevertheless, he sticks by his Duty and very rarely interferes in human affairs, because of The Rules. He has, however, been known to persuade Susan to act in his stead, not always by straightforward means; she occasionally reflects that he may have learnt a bit more about human behaviour than he lets on.  While of course in a sense he is there for every death, he need only personally attend to relatively few in order to keep things running. Death is however a caring individual and likes to keep an eye on things he does not necessarily need to, sometimes to the extent to be present at the end of a tiny tube worm on the abyssal floor. He gets quite upset when people (mostly those freshly severed from their bodies) accuse him of killing them. He argues that he simply allows them to leave this world and enter the next, and empirical evidence (such as the results of his various voluntary and involuntary sabbaticals) seems to bear this out. His jurisdiction, so to speak, appears to be Discworld itself; he is not Death in the universal sense.

He is most famous for his work on television as Johnny Carson\'s sidekick, announcer, and second banana on The Tonight Show from 1962 through 1992. He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.    The Catholic University of America  After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America  under the GI Bill and  graduated in 1949.  He majored in speech and drama while studying under the Rev. Gilbert Hartke and was a member of Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke, and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier.

The London Underground is the base of the map (which it is named after), but the map also includes the Docklands Light Railway and the London Overground network. In newer versions, the Emirates Air Line cable car, TfL Rail and London Tramlink are included.  As a schematic diagram, it does not show the geographic locations but rather the relative positions of the stations, lines, the stations\' connective relations, and fare zones. The basic design concepts have been widely adopted for other network maps around the world,  and for maps of other sorts of transport networks and even conceptual schematics.  The precursor for the current map was first designed by Harry Beck in 1931.   A regularly updated version of the tube map is available from the official TfL website.   History  Early maps  As London\'s transit network used to be a collection of independent companies, there were no full maps of the system, only ones for the individual companies. These maps were usually not schematic and were just the line overlaid on a regular city map. There was no integration of the companies\' services, nor was there any co-operation in advertising.  The first combined map was published in 1908 by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in conjunction with four other underground railway companies using the "Underground" brand as part of a common advertising factor.  The map showed eight lines\xa0– four operated by the UERL and one from each of the other four companies:  * UERL lines:  ** Bakerloo tube\xa0– brown  ** Hampstead tube\xa0– indigo  ** Piccadilly tube\xa0– yellow  ** District Railway\xa0– green  * Other lines:  ** Central London Railway\xa0– blue  ** City and South London Railway\xa0– black  ** Great Northern and City Railway\xa0– orange  ** Metropolitan Railway\xa0– red  Being geographically-based presented restrictions in this early map; to enable sufficient clarity of detail in the crowded central area of the map, the extremities of the District and Metropolitan lines were omitted, so a full network diagram was not provided. The problem of truncation remained for nearly half a century. Although all of the western branches of the District and Piccadilly lines were included for the first time in 1933 with Harry Beck\'s first map, the portion of the Metropolitan line beyond Rickmansworth did not appear until 1938 and the eastern end of the District line did not appear on the map until the mid-1950s.  The route map continued to be developed and was issued in various formats and artistic styles until 1920, when, for the first time, the geographic background detail was omitted in a map designed by MacDonald Gill.  This freed the design to enable greater flexibility in the positioning of lines and stations. The routes became more stylised but the arrangement remained, largely, geographic in nature. The 1932 edition was the last geographic map to be published, before the diagrammatic map was introduced.  Beck\'s maps  The first diagrammatic map of London\'s rapid transit network was designed by Harry Beck in 1931. Beck was a London Underground employee who realised that because the railway ran mostly underground, the physical locations of the stations were irrelevant to the traveller wanting to know how to get to one station from another\xa0— only the topology of the railway mattered. This approach is similar to that of electrical circuit diagrams; while these were not the inspiration for Beck\'s maps, his colleagues pointed out the similarities and he once produced a joke map with the stations replaced by electrical circuit symbols and names, with terminology such as "Bakerlite" for the Bakerloo line.   To this end, Beck devised a simplified map, consisting of stations, straight line segments connecting them, and the River Thames; lines ran only vertically, horizontally, or on 45 degree diagonals. To make the map clearer and to emphasise connections, Beck differentiated between ordinary stations (marked just with tick marks) and interchange stations ( | Question: What railway line is green on the traditional map of the London Underground (Tube)?', ['district line'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2723'), ('Context: The European colonization of the Americas describes the history of the settlement and establishment of control of the continents of the Americas by various European powers .

It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland\'s King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in "The Joys of Yiddish" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the "Community Regulations" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning "ring" or "bracelet".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge "woodpile"). According to the Merriam-Webster\'s dictionary, \'bagel\' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish \'beygl\', which came from the Middle High German \'böugel\' or ring, which itself came from \'bouc\' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English bēag "ring" and būgan "to bend, bow".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster\'s New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German bügel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, "beigels", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.

Contents  History[ edit ]  13th century Gothic church in Puck  The settlement became a marketplace and a seaport as early as the 7th century. The name, as was common during the Middle Ages , was spelled differently: in a 1277 document Putzc, 1277 Pusecz, 1288 Puczse and Putsk, 1289 Pucz. In 1309 it came under the rule of the Teutonic Order as part of Pomerelia . Puck achieved town status in 1348. Together with the rest of Royal Prussia , it joined Poland in 1454 ( 1466 ) and was the place of the local County Administration ( Starostwo ). The Polish kings tried to create a fleet at Danzig, but independent Hanseatic Danzig would not allow them in their territory. Ships chartered by Poland had to land at Pautzke (Puck) in 1567. Poland tried to establish a Polish Navy , gaining the use some harbors in Livonia and Finland, but a standing navy never materialized. Swedish-Lithuanian Vasa King of Poland-Lithuania Sigismund III also tried to establish a fleet in his attempts to wrest the crown of Sweden from King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden , but Sigismund's attempts were destroyed in 1628.  The first actual Polish Navy was founded at the end of World War I in 1918 with some French and British involvement.  In 1772, through the Partitions of Poland , the western Prussian town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia . After the First World War I, Puck was assigned to the Second Polish Republic by the Treaty of Versailles . In 1920 Poland celebrated Poland's Wedding to the Sea in Puck. Puck was the only Polish harbour until Gdynia was built in the 1920s and served as the main harbour of the Polish Navy until the Second World War.  Puck was bombed by Nazi Germany at 5.20am Polish time on Friday September 1, known thereafter as Grey Friday. A Luftwaffe bomber dropped a single projectile on the town, which also had an airbase.  The British and French declaration of war came two days later. That week TIME magazine in New York put a black and white picture of the Polish commander in chief, Edward Rydz-Śmigły on its cover.

A popular idol, he inspired the Romantic mystique of the virtuoso and revolutionized violin technique.  Niccolò Paganini featured on a cigarette trading card.  © Hemera/Thinkstock  After initial study with his father, Paganini studied with a local violinist, G. Servetto, and then with the celebrated Giacomo Costa. He made his first appearance in 1793 and then studied with Alessandro Rolla and Gaspare Ghiretti at Parma . In 1797, accompanied by his father, he toured Lombardy, where with each concert his reputation grew. Gaining his independence soon after, he indulged excessively in gambling and romantic love affairs. At one point he pawned his violin because of gambling debts; a French merchant lent him a Guarneri violin to play a concert and, after hearing him, gave him the instrument.  Between 1801 and 1807 he wrote the 24 Capricci for unaccompanied violin, displaying the novel features of his technique, and the two sets of six sonatas for violin and guitar. He reappeared in Italy as a violinist in 1805 and was appointed director of music at Piombino by Napoleon ’s sister, Élisa Bonaparte Baciocchi . He later gave recitals of his own compositions in many towns in Italy and about 1824 formed his long attachment with the singer Antonia Bianchi.  In 1828 Paganini experienced great success in Vienna, and his appearances in Paris and London in 1831 were equally sensational. His tour of England and Scotland in 1832 made him a wealthy man. In 1833 he settled in Paris, where he commissioned Hector Berlioz to write his symphony Harold en Italie . Paganini thought that the challenge of its viola solo was too slight, however, and he never played it. Following the failure of the Casino Paganini, a gambling house in which he had invested, he went to Marseille in 1839, then to Nice.  Paganini, etching by Luigi Calamatta after a drawing by J.-A.-D.

He was long regarded as a miser, but a more accurate portrait would consider his desire to be free from a train of dependent followers and their importunities for his largesse. His gift of 20,000 francs to the struggling composer Berlioz was an act of generosity seemingly uncharacteristic; possibly Paganini, recognizing in “ Beethoven ’s successor” a worthy talent, thought it was his duty to come to the composer’s aid.

He is best known for his work on the Astérix series and also drew other comics such as Oumpah-pah, also in collaboration with René Goscinny.  Uderzo retired from drawing in September 2011.   Early life  Uderzo was born in Fismes (Marne, France), to parents, Silvio (of Venetian descent) and Iria Crestini (of Tuscan descent), who had recently immigrated from La Spezia, Italy.  His childhood ambitions were to become an aircraft mechanic, despite his talents in art becoming apparent at an early age.     Uderzo obtained French citizenship in 1934, and during World War II, the teenaged Uderzo left Paris and spent a year in Brittany, where he worked on a farm and helped with his father\'s furniture business. He loved Brittany, both for its scenery and its people. In fact, many years later, when the time came to choose a location for Asterix\'s village, Goscinny left the decision entirely to Uderzo, only stipulating that it should be near the sea in case the characters needed to travel by boat. Uderzo had no hesitation in choosing Brittany.  Uderzo began a successful career as an artist in Paris after the war in 1945, with creations such as Flamberge and also Clopinard, a small one-legged old man who triumphs against the odds. From 1947 to 1948 he created some other comics, such as Belloy and Arys Buck.  Working with Goscinny  Throughout some more creations and travelling for the next few years, he eventually met René Goscinny in 1951. The two men quickly became good friends, and decided to work together in 1952 at the newly opened Paris office of the Belgian company, World Press. Their first creations were the characters Oumpah-pah, Jehan Pistolet and Luc Junior.   In 1958 they adapted Oumpah-pah for serial publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin, though it ran only until 1962.  In 1959 Goscinny and Uderzo became editor and artistic director (respectively) of Pilote magazine, a new venture aimed at older children. The magazine\'s first issue introduced Astérix to the French world, and it was an instant hit.  During this period Uderzo also collaborated with Jean-Michel Charlier on the realistic series Michel Tanguy, later named Les Aventures de Tanguy et Laverdure.  Astérix was serialised in Pilote, but in 1961 the first album Astérix le gaulois (Asterix the Gaul) was published as an individual album. By 1967, the comic had become so popular that both decided to completely dedicate their time to the series. After Goscinny\'s death in 1977, Uderzo continued to write and illustrate the books on his own, though at a significantly slower pace (averaging one album every three to five years compared to two albums a year when working with Goscinny). The cover credits still read "Goscinny and Uderzo".  Family  Uderzo married Ada Milani in 1953 and has one daughter Sylvie Uderzo (b. 1956).  According to The Book of Asterix the Gaul, it was speculated that Uderzo had based the characters Panacea and Zaza on Ada and Sylvie respectively, though this has been denied by Uderzo. When Uderzo sold his share of Editions Albert René to Hachette Livre, Sylvie accused him in a column in Le Monde, that with this action it was "as if the gates of the Gaulish village had been thrown open to the Roman Empire". Sylvie owns 40% of Editions Albert René, while the remaining 60%, previously owned by Uderzo and by Goscinny\'s daughter, is currently owned by Hachette Livre.  Uderzo has a brother, Marcel, also a cartoonist.   Asterix and the Falling Sky was dedicated to his late brother Bruno (1920–2004).

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball.

It was released on April 19, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was her final studio album with the record company, marking the end of a 25-year recording history. Madonna started working on the album in early 2007, and collaborated with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, The Neptunes and Nate "Danja" Hills. The album has an overall R&B vibe, while remaining a dance-pop record at its core. The Pet Shop Boys were also asked to collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros., but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation.  Madonna became interested in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but the basis of the development was Pharrell Williams\' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the process of developing the album.  Madonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art, and call it the same, but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial. She instead named the album "Hard Candy", which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness. Critical reaction to the album were generally favorable, though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market. On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best-selling album worldwide of 2008. The album has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide.  Three singles were released from the album. The first, "4 Minutes", was a worldwide success, topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna\'s 37th Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hit. Other singles released were "Give It 2 Me" and "Miles Away". To promote the album, Madonna went on a small promotional tour, where she played in three cities in small venues. The album received the majority of its promotion from the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, which went on to become the highest grossing tour ever by a solo female artist.  Background and development  In February 2007, Timbaland said that he was working with Madonna for her upcoming eleventh studio album.  It was Madonna\'s last studio album for Warner Bros. Records, and following the release of a greatest hits collection (Celebration), she would join Live Nation Artists, a new initiative launched by concert promoter Live Nation. The 10-year deal with Live Nation encompassed all of Madonna\'s future music and music-related businesses, including the exploitation of the Madonna brand, new studio albums, touring, merchandising, fan clubs/Web sites, DVDs, music-related television and film projects and associated sponsorship agreements. In August 2007, Timbaland spoke about the development of the album to MTV News. Together he and Justin Timberlake were confirmed to have worked on the album with Madonna and said that they wrote ten songs for her. Songs confirmed to have been developed were "La, La" and "Candy Shop", which was written by Pharrell Williams.  Timbaland added,  "Me and Justin did the records. [Madonna\'s] got a hot album. Her album is up there with Justin\'s album. [...] Ah, man, there\'s this one song, we taking it back to \'You must be my luck-eee starrrr!\' ... Remember \'Ugly\' by Bubba Sparxxx?

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs. Most cleaning attempts merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.

Although you can buy commercial feed for silkworms, those who want to create a sustainable system will first need to plant or track down a mulberry tree.\xa0 Silkworms don't eat as adults, and the caterpillars live entirely on fresh mulberry leaves, preferably white or black mulberries.\xa0 I haven't found information on how many silkworms you can raise on the leaves of one tree without damaging it, so I'll have to report on that after a season of experimentation.\xa0 In the meantime, I've scoped out a few additional sources to supplement my young Illinois everbearing mulberry if I run short.  Your next step is to find a source of silkworm eggs.\xa0 There are several different varieties of silkworms, but I've opted to buy so-called Peace Silkworms since the adults of this variety are able to break free of their cocoons and breed naturally.\xa0 Many other varieties have been bred to optimize silk-production and have such thick cocoons that the adults perish inside.\xa0 I'm going to try out Aurora Silk , where you can buy 200 silkworm eggs for $30 with free shipping.  Once your eggs arrive, you can keep them in a ziplock bag in the fridge for up to a few months to delay hatch.\xa0 When your mulberry tree is well leafed out, take the eggs out of the fridge and leave them at room temperature in a box or on a tray.\xa0 It should take about a week for your eggs to hatch, and you'll know they're nearly there when you see dark rings forming on the eggs.\xa0 Just before the eggs hatch, layer some mulberry leaves underneath for the caterpillars to eat, then put a clear lid with some air holes on your tray to hold moisture in the leaves without suffocating your insects.  Silkworms are voracious eaters of mulberry leaves, with various sources recommending topping off their feed once to three times per day.\xa0 When you do so, be sure to supply fresh mulberry leaves with no water on them --- young caterpillars, especially, can drown in drops of dew.\xa0 Every other day or so, clean out the old leaves (perhaps using mesh trays so that the caterpillars can crawl up into the fresh leaves without your help).  Chickens are supposed to like silkworms best when they're less than two inches long, but the insects will keep growing up to three inches.\xa0 At that size, about one month after hatching, the  silkworms stop eating and turn yellow --- your cue that they're ready to move on to the pupation phase.\xa0 Take out any remaining mulberry leaves and place the bottom half of a egg carton in the silkworm habitat, providing about one egg cup per caterpillar.\xa0 It's best to try to save at least twenty caterpillars to reach this stage if you want to keep the cycle going.  Within three days, the silkworms should have spun cocoons, and three weeks later they will emerge as flight-less moths.\xa0 Provide paper towels or another type of bedding and the female moths will mate and then lay 200 to 500 eggs apiece.\xa0 If you want to raise another batch right away, just put the eggs in a container and wait for them to hatch in a week, or move them to the fridge to store until the mulberry leaves are flush again.

He is best known for his work on the Astérix series and also drew other comics such as Oumpah-pah, also in collaboration with René Goscinny.  Uderzo retired from drawing in September 2011.   Early life  Uderzo was born in Fismes (Marne, France), to parents, Silvio (of Venetian descent) and Iria Crestini (of Tuscan descent), who had recently immigrated from La Spezia, Italy.  His childhood ambitions were to become an aircraft mechanic, despite his talents in art becoming apparent at an early age.     Uderzo obtained French citizenship in 1934, and during World War II, the teenaged Uderzo left Paris and spent a year in Brittany, where he worked on a farm and helped with his father\'s furniture business. He loved Brittany, both for its scenery and its people. In fact, many years later, when the time came to choose a location for Asterix\'s village, Goscinny left the decision entirely to Uderzo, only stipulating that it should be near the sea in case the characters needed to travel by boat. Uderzo had no hesitation in choosing Brittany.  Uderzo began a successful career as an artist in Paris after the war in 1945, with creations such as Flamberge and also Clopinard, a small one-legged old man who triumphs against the odds. From 1947 to 1948 he created some other comics, such as Belloy and Arys Buck.  Working with Goscinny  Throughout some more creations and travelling for the next few years, he eventually met René Goscinny in 1951. The two men quickly became good friends, and decided to work together in 1952 at the newly opened Paris office of the Belgian company, World Press. Their first creations were the characters Oumpah-pah, Jehan Pistolet and Luc Junior.   In 1958 they adapted Oumpah-pah for serial publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin, though it ran only until 1962.  In 1959 Goscinny and Uderzo became editor and artistic director (respectively) of Pilote magazine, a new venture aimed at older children. The magazine\'s first issue introduced Astérix to the French world, and it was an instant hit.  During this period Uderzo also collaborated with Jean-Michel Charlier on the realistic series Michel Tanguy, later named Les Aventures de Tanguy et Laverdure.  Astérix was serialised in Pilote, but in 1961 the first album Astérix le gaulois (Asterix the Gaul) was published as an individual album. By 1967, the comic had become so popular that both decided to completely dedicate their time to the series. After Goscinny\'s death in 1977, Uderzo continued to write and illustrate the books on his own, though at a significantly slower pace (averaging one album every three to five years compared to two albums a year when working with Goscinny). The cover credits still read "Goscinny and Uderzo".  Family  Uderzo married Ada Milani in 1953 and has one daughter Sylvie Uderzo (b. 1956).  According to The Book of Asterix the Gaul, it was speculated that Uderzo had based the characters Panacea and Zaza on Ada and Sylvie respectively, though this has been denied by Uderzo. When Uderzo sold his share of Editions Albert René to Hachette Livre, Sylvie accused him in a column in Le Monde, that with this action it was "as if the gates of the Gaulish village had been thrown open to the Roman Empire". Sylvie owns 40% of Editions Albert René, while the remaining 60%, previously owned by Uderzo and by Goscinny\'s daughter, is currently owned by Hachette Livre.  Uderzo has a brother, Marcel, also a cartoonist.   Asterix and the Falling Sky was dedicated to his late brother Bruno (1920–2004).

Built in 1914 as Weeghman Park, for Federal League baseball team the Chicago Whales,  the Cubs played their first game there on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 7–6 in 11 innings. In November 1918, Weeghman resigned as team president. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. acquired complete control of the Cubs by 1921. It was called Cubs Park from 1920 through 1926, before becoming Wrigley Field in 1927.  In the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field is on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 41,268. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark after Fenway Park, and the only remaining Federal League park.  Wrigley Field is known for its ivy-covered brick outfield wall, the unusual wind patterns off Lake Michigan, the iconic red marquee over the main entrance, the hand-turned scoreboard, and for being the last major league park to have lights installed for play after dark, in 1988. The area surrounding the ballpark is called Wrigleyville. Between 1921 and 1970, it was also the home of the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.  History  Baseball executive, Charles Weeghman hired architect Zachary Taylor Davis to design the park, which was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914.  The original tenants, the Chicago Whales (also called the Chi-Feds) came in second in the Federal League rankings in 1914 and won the league championship in 1915.  In late 1915, Weeghman\'s Federal League folded. The resourceful Weeghman formed a syndicate including the chewing gum manufacturer William Wrigley Jr. to buy the Chicago Cubs from Charles P. Taft for about $500,000.  Weeghman immediately moved the Cubs from the dilapidated West Side Grounds to his two-year-old park.  In 1918, Wrigley acquired the controlling interest in the club. In November 1926, he renamed the park "Wrigley Field".   In 1927, an upper deck was added, and in 1937, Bill Veeck, the son of the club president, planted ivy vines against the outfield walls.  Although Wrigley Field has been the home of the Cubs since 1916, it has yet to see the Cubs win a World Series, even though it has hosted several (1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, the last time the Cubs appeared in a World Series).  The last World Series win by the Cubs (1908) happened while the Cubs called West Side Park home.  Renovation     The Ricketts family has been aggressively pursuing a Wrigley Field renovation since buying the team and the stadium in 2009. Their current plan, revealed during the annual Cubs Convention in January 2013, calls for a $575-million, privately funded rehabilitation of the stadium to be completed over the course of five years.  The proposal is vast, and includes planned improvements to, among other things, the stadium\'s facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, press box, bullpens, and clubhouses, as well as the addition of restaurants, patio areas, batting tunnels, a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron, and an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.   After months of negotiations between the team, local Alderman Tom Tunney, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the plan obtained the endorsements of both the city\'s Landmarks Commission and Plan Commission before receiving final approval by the Chicago City Council in July 2013. To help fund the project, the team intends to more than double the amount of advertising signage in and around the stadium to about 51,000 square feet, including additional signage to be placed beyond the outfield walls – a move | Question: Wrigley Field in Chicago USA is a venue for which sport?', ['baseball', 'baseball game', 'baseball team'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1259'), ('Context: Niccolo Paganini | Italian composer | Britannica.comNiccolo Paganini | Italian composer | Britannica.com  Niccolo Paganini  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart  Niccolò Paganini, (born October 27, 1782, Genoa , republic of Genoa [Italy]—died May 27, 1840, Nice , France ), Italian composer and principal violin virtuoso of the 19th century. A popular idol, he inspired the Romantic mystique of the virtuoso and revolutionized violin technique.  Niccolò Paganini featured on a cigarette trading card.  © Hemera/Thinkstock  After initial study with his father, Paganini studied with a local violinist, G. Servetto, and then with the celebrated Giacomo Costa. He made his first appearance in 1793 and then studied with Alessandro Rolla and Gaspare Ghiretti at Parma . In 1797, accompanied by his father, he toured Lombardy, where with each concert his reputation grew. Gaining his independence soon after, he indulged excessively in gambling and romantic love affairs. At one point he pawned his violin because of gambling debts; a French merchant lent him a Guarneri violin to play a concert and, after hearing him, gave him the instrument.  Between 1801 and 1807 he wrote the 24 Capricci for unaccompanied violin, displaying the novel features of his technique, and the two sets of six sonatas for violin and guitar. He reappeared in Italy as a violinist in 1805 and was appointed director of music at Piombino by Napoleon ’s sister, Élisa Bonaparte Baciocchi . He later gave recitals of his own compositions in many towns in Italy and about 1824 formed his long attachment with the singer Antonia Bianchi.  In 1828 Paganini experienced great success in Vienna, and his appearances in Paris and London in 1831 were equally sensational. His tour of England and Scotland in 1832 made him a wealthy man. In 1833 he settled in Paris, where he commissioned Hector Berlioz to write his symphony Harold en Italie . Paganini thought that the challenge of its viola solo was too slight, however, and he never played it. Following the failure of the Casino Paganini, a gambling house in which he had invested, he went to Marseille in 1839, then to Nice.  Paganini, etching by Luigi Calamatta after a drawing by J.-A.-D.

Stories circulated that he was in league with the devil and that he had been imprisoned for murder; his burial in consecrated ground was delayed for five years. He was long regarded as a miser, but a more accurate portrait would consider his desire to be free from a train of dependent followers and their importunities for his largesse. His gift of 20,000 francs to the struggling composer Berlioz was an act of generosity seemingly uncharacteristic; possibly Paganini, recognizing in “ Beethoven ’s successor” a worthy talent, thought it was his duty to come to the composer’s aid.

Micallef Best Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Keynote Speaker  Germany and the Irish Easter Rebellion  Irish nationalists manning a baricade in Dublin during the Easter uprising  During the First World War Germany and its allies adopted a strategy of fomenting rebellion in many of Great Britain's far-flung colonies as a way of weakening Britain's military capabilities. Enver Pasha, the Ottoman Minister for War, focused on inciting rebellion among the Muslim subjects of the British Empire. Berlin, on the other hand, tried to use Irish and Indian nationalists in a similar way.  Germany also attempted to use a variation of this strategy to try to incite a war between Mexico and the United States, as well as to recruit German-Americans to fight on Germany's behalf. That gambit would backfire disastrously when its disclosure in the Zimmerman telegram paved the way for the American intervention into World War I on behalf of the Allies.  Within days of the start of World War I, Irish nationalists reached out to Germany for support in their struggle for Irish Independence. In early August of 1914, Sir Roger Casement, a former British diplomat of Irish extraction, and John Devoy, the head of the nationalist Clan na Gael, met in New York with Germany's Ambassador to the United States, Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff. At the meeting the Irish nationalists proposed to organize an Irish revolt against Great Britain if Germany would sell guns to the Irish revolutionaries and provide officers to organize and train an Irish military force.  On September 13, 1914, in Washington DC, Casement met with Franz von Papen, the German military attaché, to again seek Germany's support. At that meeting, Casement suggested that an Irish Brigade be organized from among the Irish prisoners of war from the British Army that had been captured by the Central Powers. The Brigade, he proposed, would fight alongside German troops against Great Britain and the Allies.  A month later, in October 1914, Casement, styling himself an Ambassador of the Irish nation, traveled to Germany, via Norway, to meet with officials in the German government. On December 27, 1914, in Berlin, Casement signed an agreement with German Secretary of State Arthur Zimmermann formally authorizing the creation of the Irish Brigade. The German government subsequently issued a declaration supporting Irish independence and hinting they might land an army in Ireland, someday, to advance the cause of Irish sovereignty.  The Brigade would be trained by the Germans and were to receive their own uniforms. Eventually, they would be made available to return to Ireland to fight against the British there. An Irish Brigade was in fact ultimately organized. Only 56 Irish POWs, out of the approximately 2,000 then being held in Germany, volunteered, however--far less than the usual 3,000-man strength of a brigade sized force.  The men were sent to a POW camp in Limburg for training and eventually attached to the 203rd Brandenburg Regiment.  Roger Casement and John Devoy  By the time of the Easter Rebellion in April 1916, however, the Irish Brigade had been dissolved. There is some evidence that Casement also had some involvement in a similar effort to recruit and organize an Indian brigade from among Hindu POWs held by the Germans. Dubbed the Hindu-German conspiracy, it sought German assistance to win Indian independence.  With the ongoing Battle of Verdun in full swing and Britain preparing for a new offensive on the Somme, Irish nationalists decided to organize a rebellion against British rule. Roger Casement traveled to Berlin to once again try to obtain German support for the planned uprising. He asked for 40,000 rifles to arm the Irish nationalists, as well as German officers to train them. He also sought to obtain a promise of a German landing on Ireland's west coast to support the rebels.  The Germans did subsequently offer 20,000 Russian 1891M Mosin-Nagant rifles.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious.

Hit songs "This Is the Way We Roll" and "2 Legit 2 Quit" were performed by Hammer on Saturday Night Live. Along with "Addams Groove", and other songs, "2 Legit 2 Quit" was featured in the film, The Addams Family in 1991.  In March 2003, MC Hammer released a version of the song featuring Saja.   On October 2 (televised October 12), Hammer opened the 2010 BET Hip Hop Awards performing "2 Legit 2 Quit" in Atlanta along with Rick Ross, Diddy and DJ Khaled (performing "MC Hammer" from the Teflon Don album).     At the 40th American Music Awards in November 2012, Hammer danced to "Gangnam Style" and "2 Legit 2 Quit" alongside Psy, both wearing his signature Hammer pants.

It then cuts to an impatient crowd waiting for Hammer to perform, while Hammer has a lengthy conversation with James Brown, who calls Hammer "Godson" and enlists him to get the glove of Michael Jackson. Brown endows Hammer with several blasts of energy, before sending Hammer off to perform. The performance is high budget and laden with impressive pyrotechnics. The video ends with a purported Jackson (seen only from behind) having seen the performance and conceding Hammer to be the superior dancer, while doing the "2 Legit 2 Quit" hand gesture. Hammer personally spoke with Jackson on the phone about the video, with Jackson giving his approval of it.   The song\'s music video features several athletes making cameo appearances.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Byker Grove was the original idea of late TV executive Andrea Wonfor. In 1987, Andrea approached veteran soap writer Adele Rose. Together they created a single pilot episode featuring kids aged 8–11 at an out-of-school club (transmitted on Tyne Tees TV in 1988). In autumn 1988, Andrea got backing from Anna Home, then Head of drama, BBC TV. Anna gave the green light for a run of a series of six 25-minute episodes on BBC TV. The age of the main characters was raised to 12-16 after support from first producer-director, Matthew Robinson . The first series therefore centred on young teenagers crossing the bridge from childhood to adulthood. Although some of the action took place outside the youth club, the series was unusual among dramas in that the characters were rarely shown in school. One of the major settings was the foster home run by the kindly but strict Lou Gallagher, the longest-running character.  \xa0 Famous people  Byker Grove launched the careers of Anthony McPartlin ("P.J.") and Declan Donnelly ("Duncan") who are otherwise known as Ant & Dec as well as the actress Jill Halfpenny , Donna Air , former CBBC presenter Andrew Hayden-Smith and Emmerdale actors Dale Meeks , Charlie Hardwick and Victoria Hawkins . Also appearing in the series was the now glamour model Francoise Boufhal ("Ellie Baines"). Founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson who, after Byker Grove, became executive producer of EastEnders , Head of Drama BBC Wales and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia . It was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen Mamma Mia , the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham ( This Life , Doctor Who and co-creator of BBC One\'s Life on Mars ). The first writer was Adele Rose - in Series 1 she wrote eps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, her daughter, Carrie Rose, writing ep 5 - and the most prolific was Brian B. Thompson , who wrote 50 episodes over 12 series. Tom Hooper directed four episodes of the show in 1997.

Byker Grove was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle . The actual youth club set was in Benwell , which is in the west area of the City, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne & Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the famous architecture that is the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) are used for filming backdrops.  The "youth club" building which is what the viewers see onscreen, known as The Mitre used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 90s) before it was bought by Zenith Television , who film the series.

The book has rarely, if ever, been out of print since.  The Castle of Otranto is often called the first Gothic novel. It contains almost all the classic elements: a foreign setting, walking skeleton, haunted castle, long-lost child identified by his birthmark, ominous threats and events leading to a dénouement that seems unavoidable because it is the logical conclusion of all the converging, providential actions in  the plot.  The Castle of Otranto wonderfully combines the inner turmoils of a most demonic villain –\xa0 one can almost see the toasting-fork tail under his fine clothes – a valiant hero, whose strength lies in his innocent willingness to go along with his fate; ineffectual, well-meaning friars, a psychic hermit and virtuous maidens.  All the internal struggles are played out against the most dramatic landscape of snaking dungeon passages, lightning-struck battlements, thick woods and huge supernatural coats of armour waving giant black plumes at castle windows.  The inner and outer aspects of the story are so perfectly matched that it is hard to know which is having most effect and driving the plot. There is, for the listener, a satisfying inevitability that gathers force as the story unrolls, that comes from being caught up in something much larger than the mere mortal. This illuminates the action as dramatically as lightning hits the castle, and makes it as fresh and thrilling today as when it was first devised.  The Gothic novel has been extensively parodied. Here is the real thing: larger-than-life emotions that have a power and intensity overwhelmingly their own.

His gruesome story caught the public imagination yet again in 2008  when Johnny Depp played him in Tim Burton\'s film Sweeney Todd. But who was this murderous barber, and when, if ever, did he live?  Before looking at the history of the story of Sweeney Todd one thing has to be made absolutely and unequivocally clear - there never was a barber on Fleet Street by the name of Sweeney Todd.  Yet his story has thrilled, chilled and turned the stomachs of many generations of horror seekers ever since he slashed his way into the public consciousness by way of the Victorian Penny Dreadful periodicals in the middle decade of the 19th century.  In essence his story is a simple one. He belongs to  a bygone age when men\'s home grooming was little more than primitive. Electric and safety razors were luxuries of the future and so any gentleman that required a close, clean shave was forced to entrust himself to a local barber.  Sitting in the barber\'s chair, his head tilted back, his throat exposed as the sharp blade of the barber\'s razor glided back and forth across his skin, a man would be, and indeed might well feel, decidedly exposed  and vulnerable!  Those behind the Sweeney Todd story, like many horror writers and film makers since, used the vulnerability of a familiar, everyday situation and turned it into something that would be guaranteed to illicit gasps of terror from their readers and, no doubt, instil feelings of trepidation in  to generations of men! In short  they created fear out of the familiar!  The Sweeney Todd stories have at their root a simple, blood-drenched scenario. Todd is a successful and prosperous Barber with premises at 185 Fleet Street.  Sitting his unsuspecting clients into his specially constructed barber\'s chair he lathers up their faces and suddenly tips the chair back, pitching his unfortunate customers heel over head through a trap door into the cellar below. If the fall hasn\'t killed them, Todd is compelled to \'polish them off\' with his razor. Having robbed them, he drags their bodies through an underground tunnel to the premises of his lover Mrs. Margery Lovett in nearby Bell Yard.  Here the story takes another twist creating fear from the familiar in an age when people were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today by the stomach churning device of having Todd\'s victims turned into succulent meat pies for Mrs Lovett\'s much vaunted Meat Pie Shop.  His victim\'s worldly possessions are hidden away in Sweeny Todd\'s shop, whilst any remains that haven\'t gone into a batch of meat pies are secreted in the dank, disused vaults beneath St Dunstan\'s church on Fleet Street.  As time progresses Sweeney Todd grows ever more confident and audacious, but in so doing his insatiable lust for  blood proves his undoing. Thanks to the efforts of a determined magistrate, a group of Bow Street Runners and a pair of lovers, Todd and Lovett are brought to justice and put on trial at the Central Criminal Courts or Old Bailey.  Despite the fact that several books and articles have confidently assured their readers  that Sweeney Todd did exist, there is absolutely no historical figure by that  name and indeed no barber by the name of Sweeney Todd ever found himself on  trial at the Old Bailey charged with murdering his clients and, with the aid of  his mistress and accomplice, using them to create killer recipes.  Indeed, the proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674 to 1913 are now available to peruse online via a fully searchable database.

They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are "inferior" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the "superior" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don\'t have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means \'single opening\' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children\'s toy designed by Tony Barber  "Questions about The Lost Forests" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \xa0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the "tribosphenic" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established. [5] The jaw of monotremes is constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals, and the jaw opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other pre-mammalian synapsids ; this feature, too, is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , [6] although, as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar, this is disputed.

Although only made from earth and wood, it resisted several Welsh attacks and sieges over the next 30 years, the castle establishing itself at the heart of the Norman-controlled lands of southwest Wales.  In the 12th century Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, eldest son of Roger de Montgomerie, was forced to forfeit his British lands and titles after he rebelled against King Henry I. By 1138 King Stephen had given Pembroke Castle to Gilbert de Clare who used it as a base in the Norman invasion of Ireland.  In August 1189 Richard I arranged the marriage of Isabel, Gilbert de Clare\'s granddaughter, to William Marshal who later received both the castle and the title, Earl of Pembroke. He set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive stone castle with a massive round stone keep - only royal towers of the period are comparable in scale. Marshall was succeeded by each of his five sons. His third son, Gilbert Marshal, was responsible for enlarging and further strengthening the castle between 1234 and 1241.  All of Marshal\'s sons died childless. In 1247, the castle was inherited by William de Valence, a half-brother of Henry III who became Earl of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan, William Marshal\'s granddaughter. The Valence family held Pembroke for 70 years. During this time, the town was fortified with defensive walls, three main gates and a postern.  Pembroke Castle became de Valence\'s military base for fighting the Welsh princes, during the conquest of North Wales by Edward I between 1277 and 1295.  On the death of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (son of William de Valence) the castle passed through marriage to the Hastings family. In 1389, 17-year-old John Hastings died in a jousting accident ending a line of inheritance stretching back 250 years.  The castle reverted to Richard II. Short tenancies were then granted by the Crown. By 1400 Owain Glyndwr had begun a rebellion in Wales, but Pembroke escaped attack because the castle\'s Constable, Francis а Court, paid off Glyndwr.  Eventually the castle and the earldom were presented to Jasper Tudor by his half-brother Henry VI in 1452. Tudor brought his widowed sister-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, to Pembroke where she gave birth to her only child, the future King Henry VII of England who was born in 1457.  In the 15th and 16th centuries the castle saw a period of peace. At the outbreak of the English Civil War most of South Wales sided with the King but Pembroke declared for Parliament. It was besieged by Royalist troops and saved after Parliamentary reinforcements arrived by sea from nearby Milford Haven.
