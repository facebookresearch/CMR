Morticia and Gomez summon him with a hangman 's - noose bell pull , to which he immediately appears on screen and replies , `` You rang ? '' He is physically imposing and plays the harpsichord . Cassidy made a cameo appearance as Lurch on an episode of the Batman TV series , and on TV music shows while promoting the pop song of the era `` The Lurch '' ( and the dance which it accompanied ) .   Grandmama Addams ( Blossom Rock ) -- Gomez 's mother , a witch who conjures potions and spells , and dabbles in fortune telling and knife throwing .   Wednesday Addams ( Lisa Loring ) -- Gomez 's and Morticia 's daughter and the youngest member of the family , Wednesday is a strange yet sweet - natured little girl who enjoys keeping bizarre pets such as a black widow spider named Homer and a lizard named Lucifer , in addition to playing with a beheaded doll named Marie Antoinette .   Pugsley Addams ( Ken Weatherwax ) -- Gomez 's and Morticia 's son , and Wednesday 's older brother . Kind - hearted and smart , he occasionally conforms to conventional standards contrary to his family , such as joining the Boy Scouts . He also enjoys engineering various machines , playing with blasting caps , and playing with his pet octopus Aristotle .   Thing -- A disembodied hand that appears out of boxes and other conveniently placed containers . Gomez 's constant `` companion '' since childhood , Thing is always ready to assist family members with minor daily services and diversions , such as lifting the receiver on telephones , retrieving the mail , lighting cigars , pouring tea and playing chess . Thing apparently has the ability to teleport from container to container , almost instantly : Thing sometimes appears from different containers at opposite ends of the room within seconds of each other . Though Ted Cassidy would often portray Thing , assistant director Jack Voglin would sometimes portray Thing in scenes where Lurch and Thing appear together . However , Thing was regularly billed as `` Itself '' in the closing credits . | Question: who played wednesday addams in the tv series ?", ['Lisa Loring'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-73059'), ("Context: Duane Jones as Ben : An unknown stage actor , Jones ' performance depicted Ben as a `` comparatively calm and resourceful Negro '' ( a distinguished gentleman and former university professor , in real life ) , according to a movie reviewer in 1969 . Casting Jones as the hero was potentially controversial in 1968 : it was not typical for a black man to be the hero of an American film when the rest of the cast was composed of white actors at the time , but Romero said that Jones simply gave the best audition . He was in a few other films after Night of the Living Dead and continued working as a theater actor and director until his death in 1988 . Despite his other film roles , Jones worried that people only recognized him as Ben .   Judith O'Dea as Barbra Blair : A 23 - year - old commercial and stage actress , O'Dea once worked for Hardman and Eastman in Pittsburgh . O'Dea was in Hollywood seeking to enter the movie business at the time of audition . Starring in the film was a positive experience for her , she remarked in an interview . She admitted that horror movies terrified her , particularly Vincent Price 's House of Wax ( 1953 ) . Besides acting , O'Dea performed her own stunts , which she jokingly claimed amounted to `` lots of running '' . `` I honestly had no idea it would have such a lasting impact on our culture '' , assessing Night of the Living Dead . She was just as surprised by the renown the film brought her : `` People treat you differently . ( I 'm ) ho - hum Judy O'Dea until they realize ( I 'm ) Barbra from Night of the Living Dead . All of a sudden ( I 'm ) not so ho - hum anymore ! ''   Karl Hardman as Harry Cooper : One of the film 's producers ( alongside Streiner ) , Hardman is also the voice of the newscaster heard on the radio of Johnny 's car .   Marilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper : Eastman also played a female ghoul eating an insect .   Keith Wayne as Tom   Judith Ridley as Judy : Ridley later co-starred in Romero 's second feature There 's Always Vanilla ( 1971 ) .   Kyra Schon as Karen Cooper : Hardman 's 11 - year - old daughter , Schon also portrayed the mangled corpse on the house 's upstairs floor that Ben drags away .

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?', ['2003'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4253'), ('Context: <Tr> <Td colspan="6"> Following another beating , Celeste decides to leave Perry the day after trivia night .

Aside from a further victory against Charlton Athletic on 20 February 2016 , the club again went winless until their 2 -- 1 victory over relegation strugglers MK Dons , on 2 April 2016 . Fulham finished the 2015 / 16 Championship season in 20th place , avoiding relegation by 11 points . After yet another squad overhaul , the following season saw huge improvements in both results and performances . After a good start , which included a 1 - 0 win over newly - relegated Newcastle , Fulham found themselves in 2nd place at the end of August . A poor September followed , but a significant improvement from October onwards , which included the 5 - 0 thrashings of high - flying Huddersfield Town and Reading , got Fulham back into play - off contention . Fulham secured a 6th place finish after an impressive finish to the season , which saw Fulham collect 37 points out of their last 17 games , and entered the play - offs , where they were undone by a controversial Yann Kermorgant penalty , which saw Reading triumph 2 - 1 on aggregate . After a poor first half of the 2017 / 18 season , which included a 1 - 0 loss away to bottom placed Sunderland on 16 December 2017 , Fulham struggled to break the top half of the table . Following that loss at Sunderland , Fulham went on a club - record 23 game unbeaten run in the league , which included a 6 - 0 romping of Burton Albion and wins against fellow promotion rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers , Aston Villa and Cardiff City . The run ended on the final day of the season , as Fulham fell to a 3 - 1 defeat against Birmingham City . Had Fulham won , they would have finished the season in second place , as Cardiff failed to beat Reading . Instead they would have to face the play - offs for a second season running . After overcoming a 1 - 0 away defeat to Derby County in the semi finals , Fulham won the EFL Championship play - off Final against Aston Villa to return to the Premier League on 26 May 2018 , after securing their first win at Wembley in their 139 year history . | Question: when was the last time fulham played at wembley ?", ['26 May 2018'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-46775'), ("Context: Hugh Jackman as P.T.

Mr Pilkington has a larger but more unkempt farm , and is on bad terms with Mr Frederick of Pinchfield Farm . Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber . Through Napoleon 's human aide Mr. Whymper , Napoleon furiously learns that Frederick got the timber for free as he paid in counterfeit money . Napoleon orders the slogan `` Death to Pilkington '' changed to `` Death to Frederick '' . Immediately after the bum deal , Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm , killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder . Napoleon parlays his new `` Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy , but this proves too little too late as the `` Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory , and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads `` Serves you right '' . | Question: who said serves you right in animal farm ?", ['Pilkington'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-81279'), ("Context: Michael Kelly as Lieutenant Colonel Gary Volesky   Jason Ritter as Troy Denomy   Kate Bosworth as Gina Denomy   Sarah Wayne Callies as Leann Volesky   Jeremy Sisto as Sgt .

Founded in 1999, the G20 aims to discuss policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability.  It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Milo Ventimiglia as Jack Pearson : Rebecca 's husband , and Kate , Kevin , & Randall 's father .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil . '' In Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 ( 1951 ) , the Supreme Court declared that a bail amount is `` excessive '' under the Eighth Amendment if it were `` a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial . | Question: what does excessive bail mean in the eighth amendment ?", ["a figure higher than is reasonably calculated '' to ensure the defendant 's appearance at trial"], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-84583'), ('Context: Wings of Fire : An Autobiography of APJ Abdul Kalam ( 1999 ) , former President of India .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians .

Mr Pilkington has a larger but more unkempt farm , and is on bad terms with Mr Frederick of Pinchfield Farm . Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber .

Napoleon orders the slogan `` Death to Pilkington '' changed to `` Death to Frederick '' . Immediately after the bum deal , Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm , killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder . Napoleon parlays his new `` Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy , but this proves too little too late as the `` Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory , and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads `` Serves you right '' . | Question: who said serves you right in animal farm ?", ['Pilkington'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-81279'), ("Context: The four mechanisms used to create and process the filtrate ( the result of which is to convert blood to urine ) are filtration , reabsorption , secretion and excretion . Filtration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive : it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure . About one - fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries ; four - fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries . Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day : 99 % of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed . Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive , due to diffusion , or active , due to pumping against a concentration gradient . Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active . Substances reabsorbed include : water , sodium , chloride , glucose , amino acids , lactate , magnesium , calcium , phosphate , uric acid , and bicarbonate . Substances secreted include urea , creatinine , potassium , hydrogen , and uric acid . Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate , and thereby maintain homeostasis , include ( along with the substance affected ) antidiuretic hormone ( water ) , aldosterone ( sodium , potassium ) , parathyroid hormone ( calcium , phosphate ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) .

This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic . Towards the end of this era , in 44 BC , Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated . The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar 's adopted son Octavian . Antony and Octavian 's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian 's forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ( `` first citizen '' ) with proconsular imperium , thus beginning the Principate ( the first epoch of Roman imperial history , usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284 ) , and gave him the name `` Augustus '' ( `` the venerated '' ) . Though the old constitutional machinery remained in place , Augustus came to predominate it . Although the republic stood in name , contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome . Since his rule ended a century of civil wars and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity , he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure . During the years of his rule , a new constitutional order emerged ( in part organically and in part by design ) , so that , upon his death , this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new emperor . The 200 years that began with Augustus 's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ( `` Roman Peace '' ) . During this period , the cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced . Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent , but put down `` mercilessly and swiftly '' when they occurred .

From his observations he concluded that the earthquake must have been the result of the elastic rebound of previously stored elastic strain energy in the rocks on either side of the fault . In an interseismic period , the Earth 's plates ( see plate tectonics ) move relative to each other except at most plate boundaries where they are locked . Thus , if a road is built across the fault as in the figure panel Time 1 , it is perpendicular to the fault trace at the point E , where the fault is locked . The far field plate motions ( large arrows ) cause the rocks in the region of the locked fault to accrue elastic deformation , figure panel Time 2 . The deformation builds at the rate of a few centimeters per year , over a time period of many years . When the accumulated strain is great enough to overcome the strength of the rocks , an earthquake occurs . During the earthquake , the portions of the rock around the fault that were locked and had not moved ' spring ' back , relieving the displacement in a few seconds that the plates moved over the entire interseismic period ( D1 and D2 in Time 3 ) . The time period between Time 1 and Time 2 could be months to hundreds of years , while the change from Time 2 to Time 3 is seconds . Like an elastic band , the more the rocks are strained the more elastic energy is stored and the greater potential for an event . The stored energy is released during the rupture partly as heat , partly in damaging the rock , and partly as elastic waves . Modern measurements using GPS largely support Reid 's theory as the basis of seismic movement , though actual events are often more complicated . | Question: the concept of elastic rebound was developed to explain this earthquake ?", ['the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-8438')]

Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

Guerrilla tactics were first used at the Battles of Lexington and Concord by the Patriots at April 19 , 1775 . George Washington sometimes used some sort of unconventional methods to fight the British . During the Forage War , George Washington sent militia units with limited Continental Army support to launch raids and ambushes on British detachments and forage parties , the militia and Continental Army support would skirmish with British detachments in small scale battles and engagements . Throughout the Forage War , British casualties exceeded past 900 . The Forage War raised morale for the Patriots as their guerrilla operations against the British were very effective . Next , there are other Americans that used hit and run raids , ambushes , and surprise attacks against the British such as William R. Davie , David Wooster , Francis Marion , Shadrach Inman , Daniel Morgan , Morgan 's riflemen , and the Overmountain Men . All these American guerrilla fighters did their part by using unconventional tactics to fight the British and loyalists . Nathanael Greene used a guerrilla strategy very effectively against Lord Cornwallis . First , Nathanael Greene would keep retreating to lure the British far from their supply lines , then send out his forces to fight in small skirmishes and engagements with British detachments to weaken them . Then fighting the conventional battle , Nathanael Greene fought Lord Cornwallis at Guilford Court House and gave him a severe blow . Although Lord Cornwallis was the victor , his victory was pyrrhic as he had too many casualties that he could ill afford . After the British surrender at Yorktown and America gaining their independence , many of these Americans who used guerrilla tactics and strategies became immortalized and romanticized as time passed .

Italy is part of great power concerts such as the EU trio, the NATO Quint, the G7, the G20 and various International Contact Groups. Italy, one of the UN\'s major funders, is the leading nation of the Uniting for Consensus and serves as one of the states of "chief" importance in providing shipping services, air transport and Industrial development.  Alternative terms used by academics and observers to describe this concept include "intermittent Major power" or "small Great power", asserting that Italy\'s position in the international arena can be described in this way.   G20  The G20 (or G-20 or Group of Twenty) is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies.  Currently, these are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union.  Founded in 1999, the G20 aims to discuss policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability.  It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization.  The G20 heads of government or heads of state have periodically conferred at summits since their initial meeting in 2008, and the group also hosts separate meetings of finance ministers and foreign ministers due to the expansion of its agenda in recent years. | Question: What part of the great power concerts such as the EU trio, the Nato Quint, the G7, and the G20, is Italy associated with?', ['G20'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-4825'), ("Context: Aubrey Otis Hampton  Aubrey Otis Hampton (1900, Copeville, Texas – 1955) was an American radiologist remembered for describing Hampton's hump and Hampton's line.

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , The Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .

Mr Pilkington has a larger but more unkempt farm , and is on bad terms with Mr Frederick of Pinchfield Farm . Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber . Through Napoleon 's human aide Mr. Whymper , Napoleon furiously learns that Frederick got the timber for free as he paid in counterfeit money . Napoleon orders the slogan `` Death to Pilkington '' changed to `` Death to Frederick '' . Immediately after the bum deal , Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm , killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder . Napoleon parlays his new `` Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy , but this proves too little too late as the `` Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory , and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads `` Serves you right '' . | Question: who said serves you right in animal farm ?", ['Pilkington'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-81279'), ("Context: Craig T.

Filtration occurs in the glomerulus and is largely passive : it is dependent on the intracapillary blood pressure . About one - fifth of the plasma is filtered as the blood passes through the glomerular capillaries ; four - fifths continues into the peritubular capillaries . Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman 's capsule are blood proteins , red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day : 99 % of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed . Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive , due to diffusion , or active , due to pumping against a concentration gradient . Secretion also occurs in the tubules and is active . Substances reabsorbed include : water , sodium , chloride , glucose , amino acids , lactate , magnesium , calcium , phosphate , uric acid , and bicarbonate . Substances secreted include urea , creatinine , potassium , hydrogen , and uric acid . Some of the hormones which signal the tubules to alter the reabsorption or secretion rate , and thereby maintain homeostasis , include ( along with the substance affected ) antidiuretic hormone ( water ) , aldosterone ( sodium , potassium ) , parathyroid hormone ( calcium , phosphate ) , atrial natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) and brain natriuretic peptide ( sodium ) .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services .

The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , The Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .

Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora 's travels , along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve ( with `` assistance '' from the viewing audience ) relating to riddles , the Spanish language , or counting . Common rituals may involve Dora 's encounters with Swiper , a bipedal , anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall - breaking interaction with the viewer . To stop Swiper , Dora must say `` Swiper no swiping '' three times . However , on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people , the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit .

White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills.

Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen.

White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Molly Parker as Maureen Robinson , a fearless and brilliant aerospace engineer taking her family on the mission to colonize Alpha Centauri for a new life on a better world .

Since they tended to abuse their power , Parliament passed a statute in 1275 whereby bailable and non-bailable offenses were defined . The King 's judges often subverted the provisions of the law . It was held that an individual may be held without bail upon the Sovereign 's command . Eventually , the Petition of Right of 1628 argued that the King did not have such authority . Later , technicalities in the law were exploited to keep the accused imprisoned without bail even where the offenses were bailable ; such loopholes were for the most part closed by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 . Thereafter , judges were compelled to set bail , but they often required impracticable amounts . Finally , the English Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) held that `` excessive bail ought not to be required . '' Nevertheless , the Bill did not determine the distinction between bailable and non-bailable offenses . Thus , the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted to mean that bail may be denied if the charges are sufficiently serious . The Supreme Court has also permitted `` preventive '' detention without bail . In United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739 ( 1987 ) , the Supreme Court held that the only limitation imposed by the bail clause is that `` the government 's proposed conditions of release or detention not be ' excessive ' in light of the perceived evil .

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt.

For such "indirect" discriminatory (or "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional "mandatory" or "overriding" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government\'s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product\'s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" and labelling would protect consumers "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as "chocolate". It had to be "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a "chocolate substitute" label. This was derogatory in the consumers\' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" that "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. | Question: In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?', ['motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-4255'), ('Context: EMU Australia  EMU Australia (simply referred to as EMU; pronounced "eem-you", often mispronounced "eem-moo") is an Australian lifestyle brand that designs, produces and markets footwear and accessories.

It was during the Great Depression that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow went on their two-year crime spree (1932-1934). The general attitude in the United States\xa0was against government and Bonnie and Clyde used that to their advantage. With an image closer to Robin Hood rather than mass murderers, Bonnie and Clyde captured the imagination of the nation.  Dates: Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910 -- May 23, 1934); Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909 -- May 23, 1934)  Also Known As: Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, The Barrow Gang  Overview of Bonnie and Clyde  In some ways it was easy to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde. They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the "big, bad law" who were "out to get them." Clyde\'s impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie\'s poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!)  continue reading below our video  Profile of Bonnie and Clyde  Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law.  As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde\'s many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations.  While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush.  Background of Bonnie  Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker\'s job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas).  From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4\' 11" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.)  Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn\'t a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced.  While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929.  Background of Clyde  Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde\'s parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives.  When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.  At that time, West Dallas was a very rough neighborhood and Clyde fit right in. Clyde and his older brother, Marvin Ivan "Buck" Barrow, were often in trouble with the law for they were frequently stealing things | Question: In which year in the 1930\'s were Bonnie and Clyde killed?', ['1934'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6683'), ("Context: Bloomingdale Firehouse  Bloomingdale Firehouse, also known as the Brown Square Station, is a historic former firehouse at 267 Plantation Street/676 Franklin Street in Worcester, Massachusetts.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ('Context: Wings of Fire : An Autobiography of APJ Abdul Kalam ( 1999 ) , former President of India .

The ritual is referred to as `` sitting shiva '' . Traditionally , there are five stages of mourning in Judaism . Shiva is considered the third stage of mourning , and constitutes of seven days . Following the prior two stages , shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others . It is required to observe shiva for fathers , mothers , wives , husbands , sons , daughters , brothers , and / or sisters who have died . It is not required to observe shiva for individuals who are less than thirty days old at the time of death . At the funeral , mourners wear an outer garment or ribbon that is torn during the procession in a ritual known as keriah . This garment is worn throughout the entirety of shiva . Typically , the seven days begin immediately after the deceased have been buried . Following burial , mourners assume the halakhic status of avel ( Hebrew : אבל , `` mourner '' ) . It is necessary for the burial spot to be entirely covered with earth in order for shiva to commence . This state lasts for the entire duration of shiva . During the period of shiva , individuals remain at home . Friends and family visit those in mourning in order to give their condolences and provide comfort . The process , though dating back to biblical times , mimics the natural way an individual confronts and overcomes grief .

Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him . | Question: how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island ?", ["under `` the immortal Hawke ''"], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-4123'), ("Context: In May 2013 , it was revealed that season two regular Meghan Ory ( Red Riding Hood / Ruby ) would be departing the show to star in CBS 's upcoming sci - fi drama Intelligence .

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Rock (Nominees) Ltd v RCO Holdings Ltd  Rock Nominees Ltd was part of the business empire of Lord Ashcroft, a Tory peer who has been criticised for offshore tax avoidance.

He was one of Hollywood\'s major stars from the 1940\'s onwards.  In his first five years as a movie actor he was nominated four times for the Best Actor Oscar and he was ranked by the American Film Institute at number twelve on their list of Greatest Male Stars of All Time. He received five Academy Award nominations in total and won one Best Actor Oscar for his performance in 1962 as Atticus Finch in the film \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'. In May 2003, only two weeks before Peck\'s death, his character, Atticus Finch, was voted the greatest screen hero of all time by the American Film Institute.  In addition to his Oscar, Peck received many awards including the Academy\'s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1967, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 1989, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his humanitarian work. It is no exaggeration to say that he was one of the great legends of Hollywood\'s Golden Age.  Search Amazon for Gregory Peck  Biography  He was born Eldred Gregory Peck on April 5, 1916 in La Jolla, California where his father was a pharmacist. He lived with his grandmother in La Jolla after his parents divorced when he was six and at the age of ten he was sent to St John\'s Roman Catholic Military Academy in Los Angeles. After 4 years his grandmother died and Peck went to live with his father again and began attending San Diego High School.  After graduating he spent one year at San Diego State Teacher\'s College where he took courses in drama and public speaking and then enrolled as a medical student at the University of California, Berkeley, respecting his father\'s wish that he should become a doctor. However,  Peck did not enjoy his medical studies and soon changed to studying English with the aim of becoming a newspaper reporter. His main interest outside his studies was rowing and with his 6\'3" athletic frame he was selected to represent the University.  He developed an interest in acting whilst at Berkeley and he became a regular performer in the university\'s Little Theater, discovering a natural talent and flair he had hitherto not known he possessed. When he graduated with a degree in English in 1939 he changed his name from Eldred to Gregory Peck and relocated to New York City to pursue his new vocation.  Acting Career 1940  He studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse under acting teacher Sanford Meisner and, to earn money to live, he worked for a while as a fairground barker at the 1939 World\'s Fair. Within a year he was filling small roles in short-run travelling shows but his natural, easy style marked him out, and in 1942 he was selected for his professional debut on Broadway as the lead in Emlyn Williams\'s play, \'The Morning Star\'.  During his first year as a full time actor Peck began to be noticed and to receive offers from Hollywood. He was very careful throughout his career about selecting film roles and he rejected the first movie offers made to him. After playing a double role in the stage play \'The Willow and I\', he appeared in Irwin Shaw\'s drama "Sons and Soldiers," co-starring with Stella Adler and Karl Malden and he finally accepted his debut movie role playing a resistance fighter in \'Days of Glory\' in 1944.

Both forts were named in honor of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau.  Due to a dispute between the Director-General of New Netherland and the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck regarding jurisdiction over the fort and the surrounding community, the fort and community became an independent municipality, paving the way for the future city of Albany.

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)

This event was held at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)  Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold.

Mr Pilkington has a larger but more unkempt farm , and is on bad terms with Mr Frederick of Pinchfield Farm . Frederick 's farm is adjacent to Animal Farm on the opposite side , to which Animal Farm acts as a buffer zone , sandwiched between Pinchfield and Foxwood . Frederick is in ways the antithesis of Pilkington ; he is comparatively poorer and has less land than Pilkington ; however Pinchfield is more efficiently run and more productive than Foxwood . Despite the bickering between Frederick and Pilkington , there are two factors both respectfully agree upon : they are frightened of the animal revolution that deposed Mr Jones , the original owner , fearing that their own animals may stage similar revolutions on their farmsteads , and both continue to call `` Animal Farm '' by its original name of `` Manor Farm '' , as they believe the name `` Animal Farm '' is an unofficial endorsement of the animal revolution . Mr Pilkington at first offered to buy Napoleon 's pile of surplus timber , but the timber is also sought after by Mr. Frederick , which Napoleon instigates the trade war by spreading messages of `` Death to Pilkington '' . Napoleon plays both sides by feigning friendship with Pilkington to get Frederick to pay a higher price for the timber . Through Napoleon 's human aide Mr. Whymper , Napoleon furiously learns that Frederick got the timber for free as he paid in counterfeit money . Napoleon orders the slogan `` Death to Pilkington '' changed to `` Death to Frederick '' . Immediately after the bum deal , Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm , killing many animals and ultimately destroying the windmill with blasting powder . Napoleon parlays his new `` Death to Frederick '' slogan into an attempt to rebuild relations with Pilkington by sending a message for aid against a common enemy , but this proves too little too late as the `` Death to Pilkington '' slogans are recent memory , and Napoleon gets a sole response from Pilkington which reads `` Serves you right '' . | Question: who said serves you right in animal farm ?", ['Pilkington'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-81279'), ('Context: Machete (character)  Isador Cortez, also known as Machete, is a fictional character in the four "Spy Kids" films, the "Grindhouse" fake trailer, and the "Machete" and "Machete Kills" films.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests. Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Custer State Park are attractions. The 6,000 ft (1,829 m) Mt.

Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood . Some examples include orphanages , dispensaries , and foundling hospitals . Florence 's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445 ; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health . A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 . Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants , nurse them back to health , teach them a trade or skill , and integrate them back into society . Coram 's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities . Moreover , it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital . Coram 's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity . In order to accommodate the number of children in need , there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK ; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding . Simultaneously , dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care . Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children 's hospitals . The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London , England . Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate , infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children 's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna , Moscow , Prague , Berlin , and various other major cities throughout Europe . | Question: when was the first children 's hospital built ?", ['1741'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-63693'), ("Context: Aubrey Otis Hampton  Aubrey Otis Hampton (1900, Copeville, Texas – 1955) was an American radiologist remembered for describing Hampton's hump and Hampton's line.

This event was held at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  This series of poker tournaments culminated with a $10,000 no-limit Texas hold \'em championship tournament televised by ESPN.  The last time this tournament series was run was 2010.   Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)  Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold.  Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. | Question: How many cards can a player choose from to be part of their hand in the card game that was the culmination game of the United States Poker Championship?', ['seven'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-5318'), ("Context: Eric McCormack as Will Truman : The first titular protagonist to the show , Will is a gay man who is a successful corporate lawyer who studied at Columbia University , where he met Grace as a freshman ; they have been best friends ever since .

He was one of Hollywood\'s major stars from the 1940\'s onwards.  In his first five years as a movie actor he was nominated four times for the Best Actor Oscar and he was ranked by the American Film Institute at number twelve on their list of Greatest Male Stars of All Time. He received five Academy Award nominations in total and won one Best Actor Oscar for his performance in 1962 as Atticus Finch in the film \'To Kill a Mockingbird\'. In May 2003, only two weeks before Peck\'s death, his character, Atticus Finch, was voted the greatest screen hero of all time by the American Film Institute.  In addition to his Oscar, Peck received many awards including the Academy\'s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1967, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute in 1989, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his humanitarian work. It is no exaggeration to say that he was one of the great legends of Hollywood\'s Golden Age.  Search Amazon for Gregory Peck  Biography  He was born Eldred Gregory Peck on April 5, 1916 in La Jolla, California where his father was a pharmacist. He lived with his grandmother in La Jolla after his parents divorced when he was six and at the age of ten he was sent to St John\'s Roman Catholic Military Academy in Los Angeles. After 4 years his grandmother died and Peck went to live with his father again and began attending San Diego High School.  After graduating he spent one year at San Diego State Teacher\'s College where he took courses in drama and public speaking and then enrolled as a medical student at the University of California, Berkeley, respecting his father\'s wish that he should become a doctor. However,  Peck did not enjoy his medical studies and soon changed to studying English with the aim of becoming a newspaper reporter. His main interest outside his studies was rowing and with his 6\'3" athletic frame he was selected to represent the University.  He developed an interest in acting whilst at Berkeley and he became a regular performer in the university\'s Little Theater, discovering a natural talent and flair he had hitherto not known he possessed. When he graduated with a degree in English in 1939 he changed his name from Eldred to Gregory Peck and relocated to New York City to pursue his new vocation.  Acting Career 1940  He studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse under acting teacher Sanford Meisner and, to earn money to live, he worked for a while as a fairground barker at the 1939 World\'s Fair. Within a year he was filling small roles in short-run travelling shows but his natural, easy style marked him out, and in 1942 he was selected for his professional debut on Broadway as the lead in Emlyn Williams\'s play, \'The Morning Star\'.  During his first year as a full time actor Peck began to be noticed and to receive offers from Hollywood. He was very careful throughout his career about selecting film roles and he rejected the first movie offers made to him. After playing a double role in the stage play \'The Willow and I\', he appeared in Irwin Shaw\'s drama "Sons and Soldiers," co-starring with Stella Adler and Karl Malden and he finally accepted his debut movie role playing a resistance fighter in \'Days of Glory\' in 1944.  Movie Actor 1944  His next role, in 1946, as a priest, Father Francis Chisholm, in \'The Keys of the Kingdom\' was a resounding success and brought him his first Academy Award nomination. It was the start of a run of movie successes which made Peck a major Hollywood star.

Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians. All the big events of the League of Nations were recorded in wampum. | Question: Indians used wampum for money, what was wampum ?', ['beads or shells'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7011'), ('Context: Sinatra: London  Sinatra: London is a 3CD & 1DVD Frank Sinatra box set released on November 25, 2014.

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.  (If a player\'s best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player\'s hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.)

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards.

The "sidekick" to Morse, Lewis is a Detective Sergeant in the Thames Valley Police, and appears in all 13 Morse novels. In the television adaptation, Inspector Morse, he is played by Kevin Whately. Following the conclusion of the series, Whately reprised the role as the lead character in Lewis, in which the character has been promoted to Inspector.  Character history  Inspector Morse (TV and novels)  Lewis is a sergeant on the staff of the Thames Valley Police in Oxford, England, and in Inspector Morse is assistant to the titular Detective Chief Inspector Morse. Although Lewis\'s given name is Robert (Robbie), he was rarely referred to as anything but "Sergeant Lewis" or "Lewis."  The background and personality of Lewis\xa0– a working class, easygoing family man with a Geordie accent (in the TV series; he is Welsh in the novels)\xa0– is frequently contrasted with that of Morse\xa0– Oxford educated, RP-accented, lifetime bachelor. Morse frequently uses these differences to insult or demean Lewis, perhaps from Morse\'s point of view in a playful manner, but Lewis is often not amused by the jabs. In his frustration, Lewis is often more in step with their joint superior Chief Superintendent Strange, himself an evident supporter of Lewis; however, despite a great respect towards Strange, Lewis is always unflinchingly loyal to Morse and follows his lead.  One notable difference between the Lewis from the novels and Whately\'s portrayal is that Lewis in the novels is an older man in his early sixties. When Whately auditioned for the role and then learned this fact, he considered it unlikely that he would get the part. However, Colin Dexter has consistently stated that the younger Lewis is an improvement on the character he originally created, and that if he could start the novels afresh he would begin with Lewis as he is seen in the television adaptation.  In Inspector Morse, Lewis is often shown following a hunch that Morse criticises, and in the end Lewis is usually proved correct, or at least more correct than Morse. Near the end of the television series, Lewis moves on in his career and takes a promotion. With the end of Inspector Morse and the death of its star, John Thaw, Lewis\'s adventures had seemed to come to an end.  In the episode "The Dead of Jericho", Lewis tells Morse "It\'s also my birthday". The first victim is killed on 11 June, and this utterance occurs a few days to a week later. This puts Lewis\' birthday in mid-June.  Lewis does not make an appearance in the episode "The Wench is Dead", as he is out of town on an inspector\'s course.  Lewis  In the pilot episode, Lewis returns to Oxford from a two-year stint training police in the British Virgin Islands, following the death of his wife Valerie in a hit-and-run accident. Lewis still must work partly in the shadow of the now-five-years-dead Inspector Morse, who some time prior to his death had worked a case involving one of the murder suspects as a juvenile. In the new series, Lewis gains his own junior, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (played by Laurence Fox), a Cambridge-educated man who joined the police after giving up training for the priesthood. Another staple of the series, pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (played by Clare Holman), appears late in the Morse series, and continues on through all of the Lewis episodes as a witty part of the team, with a cynical sense of humour and as a romantic interest to him.  The popularity of the one-off episode spurred the continuation of the story into a total of nine series comprising 33 episodes, the most recent airing in 2015. In the latest series, Lewis had retired from the police force, but is brought back as a consultant to work with Hathaway, who is now a detective inspector himself. | Question: In the Inspector Morse series what is the christian name of Sergeant Lewis\' wife ?', ['valerie'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7178'), ('Context: Nic Nolan  Nic Nolan (born 1 May 1958 in Chiswick, London, England) is an Australian broadcast journalist and communications consultant working with both private enterprise and State and Local Government in Australia.

Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.

In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth.  If the citizen\'s heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire.

A damned human "in damnation" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God\'s favor.  In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.   Ancient Egyptian religion  Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.  It centered on the Egyptians\' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

Texas hold \'em  Texas hold \'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold \'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker.  Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages.  The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").

In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth.  If the citizen\'s heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire.  Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal.  Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin .  A damned human "in damnation" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God\'s favor.  In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.   Ancient Egyptian religion  Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.  It centered on the Egyptians\' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.

Wampum was never used as money by the Iroquois Nations. It was used to write things down, and used as a symbol of position and title. The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

The great circle wampum, for example, was a belt worn only by a chief as a symbol of his position. Wampum was also given to seal a promise.  The colonists used wampum as money. But then, they used everything as money, including coins from many different European nations, all at the same time. To the Iroquois People, wampum was a written record.  Wampum was made from dyed beads or shells, arranged in a certain way. To make wampum:  First, you needed to collect the right sized shells or make certain sized beads.  Then, you needed to dye your materials. Individual beads and shells were dyed various shades of solid purple, solid cream, or a mix of purples and cream. No other colors were used in making wampum.  Next, you had to string your beads on a thread in a certain order, depending upon what you wanted to say. The designs made out of certain combinations of colors had both symbolic and actual meaning. Long messages were made by sewing the strings of beads together to make a wampum belt.  Obviously, you had to know what you were doing, or who knows what message you might be sending.  Wampum makers were skilled artists and trained in the messages of the wampum. They were the tribal historians.

In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth.  If the citizen\'s heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire.  Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal.  Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin .  A damned human "in damnation" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God\'s favor.  In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.   Ancient Egyptian religion  Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.  It centered on the Egyptians\' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature.  Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor.  Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.  He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.  The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the temples. | Question: In Ancient Egyptian religion how would a citizen be weighted to decide if they where worthy of damnation and would face the torment in the lake of fire ?', ['against the feather of truth'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-3713'), ("Context: The company 's ads sometimes focus on its reptilian mascot , The Gecko , an anthropomorphic Day Gecko created by The Martin Agency , modified in 2005 to a CGI character by Animation Director David Hulin and his team at Framestore .
