Nicknamed `` The Imp '' or `` Halfman '' , Tyrion Lannister of House Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister . He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall . When Cersei is not convinced , Tyrion risks execution to meet with his sister to try again to persuade her .

After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store , Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth . However , the attempt failed -- he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw -- and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face . Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa 's freak show , but was turned away . Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree , abducting children to be his audience , while murdering their `` mean '' parents . He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents , after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience 's babysitter . Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy , who becomes his accomplice . Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween , before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety . Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake , who was attracted by the noise of the clown 's performance . Twisty tells Mordrake his story , and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him . When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962 , Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments . According to director Ryan Murphy , Lynch was so terrifying as this character that `` half the time , almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him .

She threatens to call the police if she does n't see her mother soon . In `` Tupperware Party Massacre '' , Dandy admits to the murder of Dora and lets Regina escape unharmed , despite her refusal to take a blood bath with him . Upon returning with police detective Jack Colquitt , Dandy admits to the murders and boasts about his family 's wealth , buying off Colquitt for a million dollars .

Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation .", "output": ["photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots ''"]}

American fears of the Native Americans ended , as did British plans to create a buffer Native American state . The American quest for honor after its humiliations by the British were satisfied . The final collapse of the opposition Federalist Party opened an `` Era of good feelings '' with lessened partisanship and an exuberant spirit . The British paid little attention to the war , concentrating instead on their final defeat of Napoleon in 1815 . The U.S. failed to gain any territory from British North America , contrary to many American politicians ' hopes and expectations , but it did gain land from Spain .", "output": ["two centuries of peace between the United States and Britain"]}

After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond .", "output": ["late 1970s"]}

Each one of those so - called long waves has been characterized by a sustained period of social modernization , most notably by sustained periods of increasing economic productivity .

Her desire to kill Gamora abated , the pair reach an uneasy alliance , after which they discover caverns filled with the skeletal remains of Ego 's many children .

An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates ( gives to , sets aside for ) money to specific federal government departments , agencies , and programs . The money provides funding for operations , personnel , equipment , and activities . Regular appropriations bills are passed annually , with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year . The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government , which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year . When Congress and the president fail to agree on and pass one or more of the regular appropriations bills , a continuing resolution can be passed instead . A continuing resolution continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ( or with minor modifications ) for a set amount of time . Continuing resolutions typically provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous year 's funding . The funding extends until a specific date or regular appropriations bills are passed , whichever comes first . There can be some changes to some of the accounts in a continuing resolution . The continuing resolution takes the form of a joint resolution , and may provide bridging funding for existing federal programs at current , reduced , or expanded levels .", "output": ["continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ( or with minor modifications ) for a set amount of time"]}

The semiconservative model seemed most reasonable since it would allow each daughter strand to remain associated with its template strand . The semiconservative model was supported by the Meselson - Stahl experiment and other even more revealing experiments that allowed for autoradiographic visualization of the distribution of old and new strands within replicated chromosomes .", "output": ["Crick", "Watson"]}

Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' . This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements .", "output": ["Michael Madhusudan Dutta"]}

In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds .

The mRNA encodes a protein as a series of contiguous codons , each of which is recognized by a particular tRNA . One end of the tRNA matches the genetic code in a three - nucleotide sequence called the anticodon . The anticodon forms three base pairs with a codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis . On the other end of the tRNA is a covalent attachment to the amino acid that corresponds to the anticodon sequence . Each type of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid , so each organism has many types of tRNA .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-2498", "input": "Question: where can you find dna in the body ? </s> Context: DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes , and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes . The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome ; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes . The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes . Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing . For example , in transcription , when a cell uses the information in a gene , the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides . Usually , this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation , which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides . In alternative fashion , a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication . The details of these functions are covered in other articles ; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome .", "output": ["chromosomes in a cell"]}

He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty , the Allies would invade Germany from the west -- and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion . With this in mind , he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war . If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out , Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty . Hindenburg -- after prodding from his chief of staff , Wilhelm Groener -- concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale . However , rather than inform Ebert himself , he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities . Upon receiving this , the new government recommended signing the treaty . The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138 , with five abstentions ( there were 421 delegates in total ) . This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline .

He had so much gold that during his hajj to Mecca , the Mansa passed out gold to all the poor along the way . This led to inflation throughout the kingdom .

Trade was a significant factor to the rise and success of Mali . Mali flourished especially when Timbuktu came under Mansa Musa 's control . Timbuktu was a place of trade , entertainment , and education . The city 's water supply was a leading cause to its successes in trade .

Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics . During the 1930s and 1940s population genetics became integrated with other biological fields , resulting in a widely applicable theory of evolution that encompassed much of biology -- the modern synthesis .", "output": ["Charles Darwin"]}

New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped - down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-7013", "input": "Question: where are trigger points located in the body ? </s> Context: Trigger points form only in muscles . They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle . These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles . The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers . Indeed , the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine , noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH . These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region . This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999 ) . When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures . These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor . Many trigger points have pain patterns that overlap , and some create reciprocal cyclic relationships that need to be treated extensively to remove them .", "output": ["muscles"]}

However , due to normal anatomical variations , the final cord end position may occur anywhere from T12 twelfth thoracic vertebra ( T12 ) to L3 . Individual spinal nerve roots arise from the cord as they get closer to the head , but as the differential growth occurs , the top end of the nerve stays attached to the spinal cord while the lower end of the nerve exits the spinal column at its proper level . This results in a `` bundle '' - like structure of nerve fibers that extends caudally from the end of the spinal cord , gradually declining in number further down as individual pairs leave the spinal column .", "output": ["L1 or L2"]}

Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . If the process uses chemical energy , such as from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , it is termed primary active transport . Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient . Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants .", "output": ["uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient , polar repulsion , or other resistance"]}

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive .", "output": ["beta decay"]}

Cells are formed through mitosis at the basale layer . The daughter cells ( see cell division ) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source . The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted . They eventually reach the corneum and slough off ( desquamation ) . This process is called `` keratinization '' .

The term originally stems from a systematization and revival of Greek religion done by the Roman Emperor Julian . Julian used the term to describe traditional religion of the Greeks ( the word can also have other unrelated meanings in modern Greek ) . Additionally , subgroups use a variety of names to distinguish branches focusing on specific schools of thought , or modern traditions focusing on the public practices of individual city - states . These subgroups can be described as denominations . Hellenic religion , and Hellenic polytheism can be said to be used interchangeably to refer to the religion , and are synonymous .

This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice ; towards which all institutions , and the efforts of all virtuous citizens , should be made in the utmost degree to converge .

The sugar component consists of alternating residues of \u03b2 - ( 1 , 4 ) linked N - acetylglucosamine ( NAG ) and N - acetylmuramic acid ( NAM ) . Attached to the N - acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids . The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh - like layer . Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall , giving structural strength , as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm . A common misconception is that peptidoglycan gives the cell its shape ; however , whereas peptidoglycan helps maintain the structural strength of the cell , it is actually the MreB protein that facilitates cell shape .

The Bible describes Hiram I of Tyre who furnished architects , workmen and cedar timbers for the temple of his ally Solomon at Jerusalem . He also co-operated with Solomon in mounting an expedition on the Red Sea . 1 Kings 6 : 1 puts the date of the beginning of building the temple `` in the fourth year of Solomon 's reign over Israel '' . The conventional dates of Solomon 's reign are circa 970 to 931 BCE . This puts the date of its construction in the mid-10th century BCE . Schmid and Rupprecht are of the view that the site of the temple used to be a Jebusite shrine which Solomon chose in an attempt to unify the Jebusites and Israelites. 1 Kings 9 : 10 says that it took Solomon 20 years altogether to build the Temple and his royal palace . The Temple itself finished being built after 7 years . During the united monarchy the Temple was dedicated to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and housed the Ark of the Covenant .

They were the first architectural expression the new empire made in the Indian sub-continent , and fulfilled diverse functions with strong symbolic meanings . The symbolism of these gardens is derived from mystic Islamic texts describing paradise as a garden filled with abundant trees , flowers and plants , with water playing a key role : In Paradise four rivers source at a central spring or mountain . In their ideal form they were laid out as a square subdivided into four equal parts . These rivers are often represented in the charbagh as shallow canals which separate the garden by flowing towards the cardinal points . The canals represent the promise of water , milk , wine and honey . The centre of the garden , at the intersection of the divisions is highly symbolically charged and is where , in the ideal form , a pavilion , pool or tomb would be situated . The tombs of Humayun , Akbar and Jahangir , the previous Mughal emperors , follow this pattern . The cross axial garden also finds independent precedents within South Asia dating from the 5th century where the royal gardens of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka were laid out in a similar way .", "output": ["the paradise garden ( charbagh )"]}

On June 30 , 1945 , before ENIAC was made , mathematician John von Neumann distributed the paper entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC . It was the outline of a stored - program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949 . EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of instructions ( or operations ) of various types . Significantly , the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high - speed computer memory rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer . This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC , which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task . With von Neumann 's design , the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory . EDVAC , however , was not the first stored - program computer ; the Manchester Small - Scale Experimental Machine , a small prototype stored - program computer , ran its first program on 21 June 1948 and the Manchester Mark 1 ran its first program during the night of 16 -- 17 June 1949 .", "output": ["John von Neumann"]}

Harley Davidson ( Mickey Rourke ) , dressed in biker gear , with ultra-short dyed hair , hears from the radio about a dangerous new street drug named `` Crystal Dream '' . ( The significance of this street drug does not become clear until later . ) Harley goes into a rough bar and sees a cowboy - looking fellow ( Don Johnson wearing a beard , cowboy hat and boots ) . He has scammed a fellow in a pool game but has to use strong measures when the fellow refuses payment . Harley helps him in this . We learn that they are old friends ( later we learn the name he goes by is The Marlboro Man . ) They visit a blues ( old jazz ? ) bar in Burbank , which they both hold special . They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels , an extremely - heavily - muscled lad , who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over a woman . After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley . Marlboro borrows Harley 's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop , with interesting results . In a bit of psychological revelation , we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with a beautiful woman , who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man , as she is not getting enough loving from him . He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank . Showing considerable balls , Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually - fascinating airplane graveyard , but then the bank 's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty , although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money . In a running battle , Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily - declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank . The closing scene : Marlboro has gone back to rodeo bull - riding and Harley on his bike takes to the road , stopping only temporarily to pick up a ravishing and shapely hitchhiker who tells him she is going `` no place special '' , a destination that Harley promises to take her . Much of the film was filmed in and around Tucson , Arizona and the `` Boneyard '' at Davis - Monthan Air Force Base .", "output": ["Mickey Rourke"]}

He announced his invention of the first phonograph , a device for recording and replaying sound , on November 21 , 1877 ( early reports appear in Scientific American and several newspapers in the beginning of November , and an even earlier announcement of Edison working on a ' talking - machine ' can be found in the Chicago Daily Tribune on May 9 ) , and he demonstrated the device for the first time on November 29 ( it was patented on February 19 , 1878 as US Patent 200,521 ) . `` In December , 1877 , a young man came into the office of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN , and placed before the editors a small , simple machine about which very few preliminary remarks were offered . The visitor without any ceremony whatever turned the crank , and to the astonishment of all present the machine said : `` Good morning . How do you do ? How do you like the phonograph ? '' The machine thus spoke for itself , and made known the fact that it was the phonograph ... ''", "output": ["Thomas Alva Edison"]}

Through this process red blood cells are continuously produced in the red bone marrow of large bones . ( In the embryo , the liver is the main site of red blood cell production . ) The production can be stimulated by the hormone erythropoietin ( EPO ) , synthesised by the kidney . Just before and after leaving the bone marrow , the developing cells are known as reticulocytes ; these constitute about 1 % of circulating red blood cells .", "output": ["in the red bone marrow of large bones"]}
{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6830", "input": "Question: who gave the famous objective co relative theory ? </s> Context: The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative .", "output": ["T.S. Eliot"]}

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-3001", "input": "Question: when did the first train run in england ? </s> Context: The railway system of Great Britain , the principal territory of the United Kingdom , is the oldest in the world . It was started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in 1560s . The system was later built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies in late 18th century . These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network , although still run by dozens of competing companies . Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained ( see railway mania ) . The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed . However , the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network . In 1923 , almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the `` big four '' , the Great Western Railway , the London and North Eastern Railway , the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway . The `` Big Four '' were joint - stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947 .", "output": ["1560s"]}
{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-800", "input": "Question: the mughal garden of rashtrapati bhavan is modelled on which garden ? </s> Context: The founder of the Mughal empire , Babur , described his favourite type of garden as a charbagh . They use the term b\u0101gh , baug , bageecha or bagicha for garden . This word developed a new meaning in India , as Babur explains ; India lacked the fast - flowing streams required for the Central Asian charbagh . The Agra garden , which was renamed after Partition of India as the Ram Bagh , since it lied in Hindu majority portion is thought to have been the first charbagh . India , Bangladesh and Pakistan have a number of Mughal gardens which differ from their Central Asian predecessors with respect to `` the highly disciplined geometry '' . An early textual references about Mughal gardens are found in the memoirs and biographies of the Mughal emperors , including those of Babur , Humayun and Akbar . Later references are found from `` the accounts of India '' written by various European travellers ( Bernier for example ) . The first serious historical study of Mughal gardens was written by Constance Villiers - Stuart , with the title Gardens of the Great Mughals ( 1913 ) . Her husband was a Colonel in Britain 's Indian army . This gave her a good network of contacts and an opportunity to travel . During their residence at Pinjore Gardens , Mrs. Villiers - Stuart also had an opportunity to direct the maintenance of an important Mughal garden . Her book makes reference to the forthcoming design of a garden in the Government House at New Delhi ( now known as Rashtrapati Bhavan ) . She was consulted by Edwin Lutyens , and this may have influenced his choice of Mughal style for this project . Recent scholarly work on the history of Mughal gardens has been carried out under the auspicious guidance of Dumbarton Oaks ( including Mughal Gardens : Sources , Places , Representations , and Prospects edited by James L. Wescoat , Jr. and Joachim Wolschke - Bulmahn ) and the Smithsonian Institution . Some examples of Mughal gardens are Shalimar Gardens ( Lahore ) , Lalbagh Fort at Dhaka , and Shalimar Bagh ( Srinagar ) .", "output": ["charbagh"]}

Small , particularly unicellular organisms , such as bacteria and protozoa , have a high surface - area to volume ratio . In these creatures the gas exchange membrane is typically the cell membrane . Some small multicellular organisms , such as flatworms , are also able to perform sufficient gas exchange across the skin or cuticle that surrounds their bodies . However , in most larger organisms , which have a small surface - area to volume ratios , specialised structures with convoluted surfaces such as gills , pulmonary alveoli and spongy mesophyll provide the large area needed for effective gas exchange . These convoluted surfaces may sometimes be internalised into the body of the organism .

However , from the testimony of Pseudo-Bede , it is known that churches in what are now England and Germany were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century . Thus , Louis merely made official the custom of celebrating it on 1 November . James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead ( Samhain ) -- the Celts had influenced their English neighbours , and English missionaries had influenced the Germans . However , Ronald Hutton points out that , according to \u00d3engus of Tallaght ( d . ca . 824 ) , the 7th / 8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April . He suggests that the 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea . In the 11th century , 2 November became established as All Souls ' Day .

Heisenberg 's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics . While Heisenberg 's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a `` major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system , '' he still assumed the presence of nuclear electrons . In particular , Heisenberg assumed the neutron was a proton -- electron composite , for which there is no quantum mechanical explanation . Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus . Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-8157", "input": "Question: why does cooling water run through the condenser ? </s> Context: Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine . Condensers use relatively cool water , via various means , to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines . This reduces the back pressure , which in turn reduces the steam consumption , and thus the fuel consumption , while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler - water . However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 . While water usage is not an issue with marine engines , it forms a significant limitation for many land - based systems .", "output": ["to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines"]}

In medieval etymology , Veronica was sometimes wrongly supposed to derive from Latin vera ( true ) and Greek eikon ( image ) . Its popularity in medieval and modern times is based mainly on the importance in Christianity of Saint Veronica and her Veil of Veronica . Pet forms of Veronica include Ronnie and Roni and the German Frony . In Russian , the pet form is Nika ( \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0430 ) . `` Veronica '' is a popular name in many countries in the Mediterranean , Eastern Europe , and Latin America , as well as southern Ireland , France , and French - speaking Canada .", "output": ["she who brings victory"]}

A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages .

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-8994", "input": "Question: what are the active materials of a lead acid battery ? </s> Context: Lead -- acid batteries lose the ability to accept a charge when discharged for too long due to sulfation , the crystallization of lead sulfate . They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction . Lead and lead dioxide , the active materials on the battery 's plates , react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate . The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided , amorphous state , and easily reverts to lead , lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges . As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges , some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging . Thus , not all the lead is returned to the battery plates , and the amount of usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time .", "output": ["Lead and lead dioxide"]}

In the muscle , there are groups of highly specialized cells that work together to perform a function known as muscle contraction . A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true function of this muscle contraction is known as a microfilament . Microfilaments are composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin . During contraction of a muscle , within each muscle cell , myosin molecular motors collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments . Muscle contraction starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum . Increases in calcium in the cytosol allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins , tropomyosin and troponin . Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin , while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition . This action contracts the muscle cell , and through the synchronous process in many muscle cells , the entire muscle .", "output": ["Microfilaments"]}

The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' .

The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position . Certain aspects of the draft , including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft , have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936 , but the fundamental methodology has remained the same . Currently the draft consists of seven rounds . The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would , ideally , have chosen the best player available .", "output": ["each team"]}

{"id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-180", "input": "Question: where does the electron transport chain pumps protons ? </s> Context: Most eukaryotic cells have mitochondria , which produce ATP from products of the citric acid cycle , fatty acid oxidation , and amino acid oxidation . At the mitochondrial inner membrane , electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through the electron transport chain to oxygen , which is reduced to water . The electron transport chain comprises an enzymatic series of electron donors and acceptors . Each electron donor will pass electrons to a more electronegative acceptor , which in turn donates these electrons to another acceptor , a process that continues down the series until electrons are passed to oxygen , the most electronegative and terminal electron acceptor in the chain . Passage of electrons between donor and acceptor releases energy , which is used to generate a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane by actively `` pumping '' protons into the intermembrane space , producing a thermodynamic state that has the potential to do work . The entire process is called oxidative phosphorylation , since ADP is phosphorylated to ATP using the energy of hydrogen oxidation in many steps .", "output": ["mitochondrial membrane"]}

Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 .

For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being .

He quickly establishes himself as a more unconventional , ruthless litigator than his predecessor , Ben Stone ( Michael Moriarty ) . He often bends -- and sometimes breaks -- trial rules to get convictions , finds tenuous rationales for charging defendants with crimes when the original charges fail to stick , and charges innocent people to frighten them into testifying against others . McCoy is found in contempt of court 80 times for such behavior , and his tactics occasionally incur negative publicity for the DA 's office . His underlying motivation , however , is not , he maintains , corruption , but a sincere desire to see justice done . To that end , McCoy has gone after defendants accused of perverting the justice system to arrange wrongful convictions with just as much determination as his more mundane cases . Such aggressive actions in the courts have earned him the nickname `` Hang ' em High McCoy '' . He has subsequently developed a reputation with both colleagues and rival attorneys , once being referred to as `` the top of the legal food chain '' by a rival attorney during a trial .", "output": ["the season - five premiere episode `` Second Opinion ''"]}
