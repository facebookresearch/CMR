{"input": "Question: in photosynthesis the carbon in co2 is initially fixed to what molecule ? </s> Context: In C plants , the first step in the light - independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO by the enzyme RuBisCO into 3 - phosphoglycerate . However , due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of RuBisCo , some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated , resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy , in what is known as photorespiration . In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway , C plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO to the RuBisCO enzyme . They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well . Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle , CO is incorporated into a 4 - carbon organic acid , which has the ability to regenerate CO in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells .

By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet .", "truth": ["1835"], "id": "mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-2405", "mistake": "The ability to compare ammunition is a direct result of the invention of rifled around the turn of the 16th century", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "nq", "init_status": "error"}

{"input": "Question: american horror story freak show girl kidnapped by clown ? </s> Context: Twisty the Clown ( portrayed by John Carroll Lynch ) originally was a slow - witted but gentle clown at a freak show in 1943 . Jealous of his popularity , the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away . With nowhere else to go , he returned home to Jupiter , Florida , only to find that his mother had died . After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store , Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth . However , the attempt failed -- he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw -- and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face . Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa 's freak show , but was turned away . Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree , abducting children to be his audience , while murdering their `` mean '' parents . He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents , after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience 's babysitter . Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy , who becomes his accomplice . Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween , before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety . Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake , who was attracted by the noise of the clown 's performance . Twisty tells Mordrake his story , and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him . When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962 , Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments . According to director Ryan Murphy , Lynch was so terrifying as this character that `` half the time , almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him .

{"input": "Question: Which state on the Gulf of Mexico is nearest the end of the alphabet? </s> Context: Gulf of MexicoThe Gulf of Mexico () is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent.  It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \"Third Coast\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \"south coast\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \"north coast.\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  The Gulf of Mexico formed approximately 300 million years ago as a result of plate tectonics.  The Gulf's basin is roughly oval and is approximately 810 nmi wide and floored by sedimentary rocks and recent sediments. It is connected to part of the Atlantic Ocean through the Florida Straits between the U.S. and Cuba, and with the Caribbean Sea (with which it forms the American Mediterranean Sea) via the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba. With the narrow connection to the Atlantic, the Gulf experiences very small tidal ranges. The size of the Gulf basin is approximately 1.6 million km2 (615,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Almost half of the basin is shallow continental shelf waters. The basin contains a volume of roughly 2,500 quadrillion liters (550 quadrillion Imperial gallons, 660 quadrillion US gallons, 2.5 million km3 or 600,000 cu mi).   Extent  The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southeast limit of the Gulf of Mexico as follows:   A line leaving Cape Catoche Light () with the Light on Cape San Antonio in Cuba, through this island to the meridian of 83\u00b0W and to the Northward along this meridian to the latitude of the South point of the Dry Tortugas (24\u00b035'N), along this parallel Eastward to Rebecca Shoal (82\u00b035'W) thence through the shoals and Florida Keys to the mainland at eastern end of Florida Bay, all the narrow waters between the Dry Tortugas and the mainland being considered to be within the Gulf.  Geology  The consensus among geologists   who have studied the geology of the Gulf of Mexico, is that prior to the Late Triassic, the Gulf of Mexico did not exist. Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies Yucatan, within the middle of the large supercontinent of Pangea. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the Marathon Uplift in West Texas and the Ouachita Mountains of Oklahoma, and to Alabama where it linked directly to the Appalachian Mountains. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late Cretaceous times by the formation of the Mississippi Embayment.    Geologists and other Earth scientists agree in general that the present Gulf of Mexico basin originated in Late Triassic time as the result of rifting within Pangea. The rifting was associated with zones of weakness within Pangea, including sutures where the Laurentia, South American, and African plates collided to create it. First, there was a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical thickness, 35 kilometers, of normal continental crust. It was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the Gulf of Mexico. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of Louann Salt and associated anhydrite evaporites.

Conran was educated at Highfield School in Liphook, Bryanston School in Dorset and the Central School of Art and Design (now incorporated into Central St Martin's, a part of the University of the Arts, London), where he studied textiles and other materials.  Work  Conran's first professional work came when he worked in the Festival of Britain (1951) on the main South Bank site. He left college to take up a job with Dennis Lennon's architectural company, which had been commissioned to make a 1/4-scale interior of a Princess Flying Boat.  Conran started his own design practice in 1956 with the Summa furniture range and designing a shop for Mary Quant.  In 1964, he opened the first Habitat shop in Chelsea, London, with his third wife Caroline Herbert, which grew into a large chain selling household goods and furniture in contemporary designs.

Where are they from, what are their compositions and some special features about them.  1. TEA  Tea is a drink made by infusing leaves of the tea plant in hot water. The name \u2018tea\u2019 is also used to refer to the leaves themselves; and it is also the name of a mid- to late-afternoon meal in the British Isles and associated countries, at which tea (the drink) is served along with various foods.  Tea has been an item of trade and tribute for at least three thousand years. It was first cultivated and brewed in China, and many of the best varieties still come from China. Some of the finest oolongs in the world are grown in Taiwan. Japan also produces a considerable amount of green tea, most of which is consumed domestically.  After the British took up tea drinking, they began cultivating the plants native to India in order to have more control over the trade. India, Sri Lanka, and other South Asian countries produce a large portion of the world harvest.  Never miss a post about healthy drinks, like our page  Drink Healthy Drinks on Facebook.  Standage says tea played a leading role in the expansion of imperial and industrial might in Great Britain many centuries later. During the 19th century, the East India Company enjoyed a monopoly on tea exports from China.  As the Industrial Revolution of 18th and 19th centuries gained steam, tea provided some of the fuel. Factory workers stayed alert during long, monotonous shifts thanks to welcome tea breaks.  The beverage also had unintended health benefits for rapidly growing urban areas.  2. WATER  Water (H2O) is often perceived to be ordinary as it is transparent, odorless, tasteless and ubiquitous. It is the simplest compound of the two most common reactive elements, consisting of just two hydrogen atoms attached to a single oxygen atom. Indeed, very few molecules are smaller or lighter.  From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Without water, your body would stop working properly. Water makes up more than half of your body weight and a person can\u2019t survive for more than a few days without it. Why? Your body has lots of important jobs and it needs water to do many of them. For instance, your blood, which contains a lot of water, carries oxygen to all the cells of your body. Without oxygen, those tiny cells would die and your body would stop working. In addition to being an important part of the fluids in your body, each cell depends on water to function normally.  3. COFFEE  Coffee is a well-known beverage prepared from coffee beans, of the coffee plant.  The story of how coffee growing and drinking spread around the world is one of the greatest and most romantic in history and starts in the Arabian Peninsula, where roasted beans were first brewed around A.D. 1000. Sometime around the 15th century coffee spread throughout the Arab world.  When coffee arrived in Europe it was similarly hailed as an \u201canti-alcohol\u201d that was quite welcome during the Age of Reason in the 18th century.  Coffee raises capacity for work, gives strengths and energy and topes up. But there is a negative coffee\u2019s influence in the human\u2019s health because of its caffeine.

In The Wake of Poseidon followed in May. While McDonald and Giles had announced their intention to leave in December of 1969 and Greg Lake would depart in April of 1970, Giles and Lake appeared on the single and album with Peter Giles (formerly of Giles, Giles & Fripp) and incoming members Keith Tippett, Mel Collins and Gordon Haskell alongside Fripp and Sinfield. As a result, the album shares some similarities in approach and sound to their debut, In the Court of the Crimson King and has been a firm favorite among fans of the band since its initial release.  Though working with a transitional lineup the album sounds remarkably cohesive. Like the debut album, In The Wake Of Poseidon was self produced and displayed an increased confidence in the use of the recording studio. The breadth of material recorded is even broader than the debut. The short \"Peace\" appears in 3 different settings bookending the album\u2019s longer tracks. One of the band\u2019s prettiest ballads \"Cadence & Cascade\" leads into the powerful title track, while the album version of \"Catfood\" is followed by \"The Devil\u2019s Triangle,\" an ambitious sound collage that seems to owe more to contemporary classical and free jazz roots than any form of rock music. The short burst of \u201cIn the Court of the Crimson King\u201d in the final part of the track eerily anticipates modern sampling techniques.  Upon release, In The Wake Of Poseidon reached #4 on the UK album charts, one position higher than their debut and the highest chart placing the band enjoyed in Britain.  Track Listing:  2.

His father, Suddhodana,                    was the ruler of the Sakya people and Siddhartha grew up living                    the extravagant life of a young prince. According to custom,                    he married at the young age of sixteen to a girl named Yasodhara.                    His father had ordered that he live a life of total seclusion,                    but one day Siddhartha ventured out into the world and was confronted                    with the reality of the inevitable suffering of life. The next                    day, at the age of twenty-nine, he left his kingdom and newborn                    son to lead an ascetic life and determine a way to relieve universal                    suffering.  For six years,                    Siddhartha submitted himself to rigorous ascetic practices,                    studying and following different methods of meditation with                    various religious teachers. But he was never fully satisfied.                    One day, however, he was offered a bowl of rice from a young                    girl and he accepted it. In that moment, he realised that physical                    austerities were not the means to achieve liberation. From then                    on, he encouraged people to follow a path of balance rather                    than extremism. He called this The Middle Way.  That night Siddhartha sat under the Bodhi tree, and meditated until dawn. He purified                    his mind of all defilements and attained enlightenment at the                    age of thirty-five, thus earning the title Buddha, or \"Enlightened                    One\". For the remainder of his eighty years, the Buddha                    preached the Dharma in an effort to help other sentient beings                    reach enlightenment.

This sect came to be known as Sangha, to distinguish it from other similar communities. The teachings of Siddhartha Gautama are considered the core of Buddhism : after his death, the community he founded slowly evolved into a religious-like movement which was finally established as a state religion in India by the time of Emperor Ashoka , during the 3rd century BCE.  Siddhartha is a Sanskrit personal name which means \"He Who Achieves His Goal\". The name is best known in English as the title of the novel by Hermann Hesse, in which the main character (who actually is not the Buddha) is named Siddhartha. The Sanskrit family name Gautama means \"descendants of Gotama\". Gotama is the name of several figures in ancient India, including a poet of the Rig Veda and also Aksapada Gautama (or Gotama), a famous Indian logician. Pali literature normally refers to Siddhartha Gautama as Gotama Buddha.  Remove Ads  Advertisement  Traditionally, the meaning of the term Buddha is understood as a person who has awakened from the deep sleep of ignorance. In Indian tradition, the expression was already used before, during, and after the life of Siddhartha by many religious communities, but it became most strongly linked to the Buddhist tradition.  Historical Context  At the time when Siddhartha Gautama lived, Northern India was composed of numerous and small independent states competing for resources. This was a time when the traditional religious order in India was being challenged by a number of new philosophical and religious schools that were not in line with the orthodox Indian religious views. The Vedic philosophy , theology and metaphysics, along with its ever growing complexity of rituals and sacrificial fees, was being questioned. Materialistic schools were running wild in India, undermining the reputation and authority of the priestly class, leading to a temporary religious anarchy which contributed to the development of new religions.

{"input": "Question: Who solved 'The Riddle of The Sphinx'? </s> Context: SphinxA sphinx (, Boeotian: ) is a mythical creature with, at a minimum, the head of a human and the body of a lion.  In Greek tradition, it has the head of a human, the haunches of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a bird. It is mythicised as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer its riddle suffer a fate typical in such mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster.  This deadly version of a sphinx appears in the myth and drama of Oedipus.  Unlike the Greek sphinx, which was a woman, the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man (an androsphinx). In addition, the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and both were thought of as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.   In European decorative art, the sphinx enjoyed a major revival during the Renaissance. Later, the sphinx image, something very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept, was exported into many other cultures, albeit often interpreted quite differently due to translations of descriptions of the originals and the evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions.  Sphinxes are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal tombs or religious temples. The oldest known sphinx was found near Gobekli Tepe at another site, Nevali \u00c7ori,  or possibly 120 miles to the east at Kortik Tepe, Turkey, and was dated to 9,500 BCE.   Egyptian sphinxes  The largest and most famous sphinx is the Great Sphinx of Giza, situated on the Giza Plateau adjacent to the Great Pyramids of Giza on the west bank of the Nile River and facing east (). The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. Although the date of its construction is uncertain, the head of the Great Sphinx now is believed to be that of the pharaoh Khafra.  What names their builders gave to these statues is not known. At the Great Sphinx site, a 1400 BCE inscription on a stele belonging to the 18th dynasty pharaoh Thutmose IV lists the names of three aspects of the local sun deity of that period, Khepera\u2013R\u00ea\u2013Atum. The inclusion of these figures in tomb and temple complexes quickly became traditional and many pharaohs had their heads carved atop the guardian statues for their tombs to show their close relationship with the powerful solar deity, Sekhmet, a lioness. Other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh Hatshepsut, with her likeness carved in granite, which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the alabaster sphinx of Memphis, Memphis, Egypt, currently located within the open-air museum at that site. The theme was expanded to form great avenues of guardian sphinxes lining the approaches to tombs and temples as well as serving as details atop the posts of flights of stairs to very grand complexes. Nine hundred with ram heads, representing Amon, were built in Thebes, where his cult was strongest.  Perhaps the first sphinx in Egypt was one depicting Queen Hetepheres II, of the fourth dynasty that lasted from 2723 BCE to 2563. She was one of the longest-lived members of the royal family of that dynasty.  The Great Sphinx has become an emblem of Egypt, frequently appearing on its stamps, coins, and official documents.   Greek traditions  From the Bronze Age, the Hellenes had trade and cultural contacts with Egypt. Before the time that Alexander the Great occupied Egypt, the Greek name, sphinx, was already applied to these statues. The historians and geographers of Greece wrote extensively about Egyptian culture. Herodotus called the ram-headed sphinxes Criosphinxes and called the hawk-headed ones Hieracosphinxes.  The word sphinx comes from the Greek \u03a3\u03c6\u03af\u03b3\u03be, apparently from the verb \u03c3\u03c6\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03c9 (sph\u00edng\u014d), meaning \"to squeeze\", \"to tighten up\".   This name may be derived from the fact that the hunters for a pride of lions are the lionesses, and kill their prey by strangulation, biting the throat of prey and holding them down until they die.

{"input": "Question: A bagel is a type of what? </s> Context: BagelA bagel ( '; ), also spelled beigel,  is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.    Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.  Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (either fresh or frozen, and often in many flavor varieties) in many major supermarkets in those countries.  The basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing for a more even cooking and baking of the dough: the hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing for easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.    History   Contrary to some beliefs, the bagel was not created in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the victory of Poland's King John III Sobieski over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Linguist Leo Rosten wrote in \"The Joys of Yiddish\" about the first known mention of the Polish word bajgiel derived from the Yiddish word bagel in the \"Community Regulations\" of the city of Krak\u00f3w in 1610, which stated that the item was given as a gift to women in childbirth.   In the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the bajgiel became a staple of Polish cuisine,  and a staple of the Slavic diet generally.  Its name derives from the Yiddish word beygal from the German dialect word beugel, meaning \"ring\" or \"bracelet\".  Variants of the word beugal are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a somewhat similar form of sweet filled pastry (Mohnbeugel (with poppy seeds) and Nussbeugel (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where beuge refers to a pile, e.g., holzbeuge \"woodpile\"). According to the Merriam-Webster's dictionary, 'bagel' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish 'beygl', which came from the Middle High German 'b\u00f6ugel' or ring, which itself came from 'bouc' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English b\u0113ag \"ring\" and b\u016bgan \"to bend, bow\".  Similarly, another etymology in the Webster's New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German beugel, a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German b\u00fcgel, a stirrup or ring.   In the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels, or as locally spelled, \"beigels\", have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.  Bagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City [when? 1800?  1960?] that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338, which had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand. The bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century, which was due at least partly to the efforts of bagel baker Harry Lender, his son,", "truth": ["bread", "bread making", "breads"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2896", "mistake": "a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.2222222222222222}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

It is a favorite for ballet recitals and professional ballet companies alike. Although the ballet was composed in 1876, most performances of Swan Lake today are actually based on the 1895 revival version of the ballet. If you have ever wondered who composed Swan Lake and the later revival version that is best known today, continue reading to discover the answer.  Who composed Swan Lake?  The original composition for Swan Lake was completed by the famous Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky. He began work on Swan Lake in 1875 and finished it in 1876. The first performance of Swan Lake was in 1877 at the famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. The choreography of the original production was completed by Julius Reisinger.  There was talk about revising Swan Lake in the late 1880\u2032s and early 1890\u2032s, but Tchaikovsky died in 1893 and historians do not know whether he was planning to revise the score himself. The 1895 revival of Swan Lake is still mostly based on the Tchaikovsky composition, but was heavily revised by Italian composer Riccardo Drigo. Drigo made some considerable changes, including lengthening and shortening passages of the composition. The choreography of the 1895 Swan Lake revival was completed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov (2nd and 4th scenes). It has since become one of the greatest ballets of all time.

( Read the synopsis of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. )\u00a0On March 4, 1877,\u00a0Swan Lake\u00a0premiered at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre.  The Original Production of Swan Lake  Much is unknown about the original production of\u00a0Swan Lake\u00a0\u2013 no notes, techniques, or instructions concerning the ballet were written down. What little information that could be found exists in a handful of letters and memos.\u00a0Like The Nutcracker , Swan Lake was unsuccessful after its first year of performance. Conductors, dancers, and audiences alike thought Tchaikovsky's music was far too complicated and the ballet dancers in particular had difficulty dancing to the music. The production\u2019s original choreography by German ballet master, Julius Reisinger, was criticized harshly as uninspiring and unoriginal.  continue reading below our video  Best Vacation Reads of 2015  \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until after Tchaikovsky\u2019s death that Swan Lake was revived.  From 1871 to 1903, ballet's most influential dancer, choreographer, and teacher, Marius Petipa held the position of Premier ma\u00eetre de ballet at the Russian Imperial Theatre. Thanks to his extensive research and reconstruction efforts, Petipa along with Lev Ivanov revived and revised Swan Lake\u00a0in 1895. Performances of\u00a0Swan Lake\u00a0today, are likely to feature Petipa's and Ivanov's choreography.  The Meaning of the Swan  We do know that Tchaikovsky was granted a great deal of control over the story's content. He and his colleagues both agreed that the swan represented womanhood in its purest form. The stories and legends of swan-maidens date as far back as ancient Greece; when the Greek god Apollos was born, flying swans circled above their heads. Legends of swan maidens can also be found in The Tales of the Thousand and One Nights, Sweet Mikhail Ivanovich the Rover and The Legend of the Children of Lir.  Pierina Legnani and\u00a0Swan Lake  Swan Lake is known for its demanding technical skills all because of one extremely gifted ballerina, Pierina Legnani.

Gina Lollobrigida  \u2018  TCM Overview:  One of several earthy Italian beauties to set the film world on fire during the 1950s and 1960s, Gina Lollobrigida was an actress and director whose skill at both drama and light comedy was often overshadowed by her voluptuous figure. Though she never enjoyed the acclaim of contemporaries like Sophia Loren or Anna Magnani, she worked steadily in Hollywood and international features for nearly three decades, appearing opposite Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster in the circus-themed \u201cTrapeze\u201d (1956) and Victor Hugo\u2019s remake of \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d (1956). In 1959, she made quite an impression as the sexually-charged queen in the biblical epic \u201cSolomon and Sheba,\u201d and earned a Golden Globe for her starring role opposite Rock Hudson in the romantic comedy \u201cCome September\u201d (1961). Lollobrigida went on to enjoy further success with the Italian-made \u201cVenere Imperiale\u201d (1962), \u201cStrange Bedfellows\u201d (1965) and \u201cBuona Sera, Mrs. Campbell\u201d (1968), only to see her career wind down in the early 1970s. Though she earned praise for a 1984 guest spot on \u201cFalcon Crest\u201d (CBS, 1981-1990), Lollobrigida focused her attention on other artistic endeavors like photojournalism and sculpting, while also being active in promoting Italian-American heritage and even dabbling in politics with an unsuccessful run for Italian office. Despite a later career of unimpressive films, Lollobrigida remained one of Italy\u2019s premiere exports.  Born Luigina Lollobrigida in Subiaco, Italy on July 4, 1927, she was one of four daughters born to her father, a furniture maker. She competed successfully in several beauty pageants as a teenager, and earned a living as a model for magazines and illustrated novels under the name Diana Loris. She relocated to Rome in the mid-1940s and continued to model and compete while studying sculpture and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts at Rome. She was discovered there by talent scouts who convinced her to try her hand at acting. She made her film debut as an extra in the costume adventure \u201cAquila Nera\u201d in 1946. A year later, she placed third in the Miss Italia pageant, which increased her exposure significantly. More roles in Italian films followed before she came to the attention of American magnate and film producer Howard Hughes, who allegedly signed her to a Hollywood contract. Said document was later the source of a dispute between the actress and Hughes, which held up her Hollywood debut until nearly a decade later.  By the 1950s, Lollobrigida was enjoying considerable popularity from her film career; her face and figure graced covers and layouts in countless international publications, which dubbed her \u201cLa Lollo\u201d or \u201cThe Most Beautiful Woman in the World,\u201d after her 1955 film of the same name. Her signature hairstyle, dubbed \u201cthe tossed salad,\u201d found favor among fashion-forward types, even serving as the name for a particular type of lettuce. Lovestruck admirers, however, were disheartened to know that she was happily married to Yugoslavian doctor Milko Skofic, with whom she had one son.

{"input": "Question: In geometry, what name is given to a straight line from the circumference to the centre of a circle or sphere? </s> Context: The Three Geometries - EscherMathThe Three Geometries - EscherMath  The Three Geometries  Axioms and the History of Non-Euclidean Geometry  Euclidean Geometry and History of Non-Euclidean Geometry  In about 300 BCE, Euclid penned the Elements, the basic treatise on geometry for almost two thousand years.  Euclid starts of the Elements by giving some 23 definitions. After giving the basic definitions he gives us five \u201cpostulates\u201d.  The postulates (or axioms) are the assumptions used to define what we now call Euclidean geometry. [1]  The five axioms for Euclidean geometry are:  Any two points can be joined by a straight line. (This line is unique given that the points are distinct)  Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.  Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.  All right angles are congruent.  Through a point not on a given straight line, one and only one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.  The fifth postulate is called the parallel postulate. Euclid used a different version of the parallel postulate, and there are several ways one can write the 5th postulate. They are all equivalent and lead to the same geometry.  \"If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.\" (Euclid's version)  \"The sum of the angles in a triangle is exactly 180 degrees.\"  \u201cgiven a line L, and a point P not on that line, there is exactly one line through P which is parallel to L\u201d.  The axioms are basic statements about lines, line segments, circles, angles and parallel lines. We need these statements to determine the nature of our geometry.  The fifth postulate, the \u201cparallel postulate\u201d, seemed more complicated and less obvious than the other four, so for many hundreds of years mathematicians attempted to prove it using only the first four postulates as assumptions.  The Greeks already studied spherical trigonometry. Hipparchus (190 BC-120 BC) was a Greek astronemer. hipparchus was known for his work in trigonometry and he may have known some results about spherical triangles. [2] Menelaus of Alexandria (ca 100 AD) worked on spherical geometry and was the first known to publish a treatise on the subject. Menelaus' work was called Sphaerica (3 volumes) and included material on the properties of spherical triangles. [3] Ptolemy (ca 90 - 168 AD) also included some studies of spherical triangles in his work. [4] Hyperbolic geometry, in comparison, took a lot longer to develop.  We saw that the parallel postulate is false for spherical geometry (since there are no parallel geodesics), but this is not helpful since some of the first four are false, too.  For example there are many geodesics through a pair of antipodal points.  In fact, the first four postulates (plus the assumption that lines are infinite) imply that given a line and a point not on that line, there is a parallel line as required.  The subtle question is:  can there be more than one? [5]  In 1733, the Jesuit priest Giovanni Saccheri began by assuming the fifth postulate was false, and attempted (at great length) to derive a statement contradicting the other four.  In doing so, he nearly produced the theory of hyperbolic geometry.  However, his goal was not to discover new kinds of geometry, but to rule them out, so he concluded his treatise with a rant about the absurdity of everything he had just written.  The great German mathematician Carl Freidrich Gauss apparently believed that a geometry did exist which satisfied Euclid\u2019s first four postulates but not the fifth.  However, Gauss never published or discussed this work because he felt his reputation would suffer if he admitted he believed in non-Euclidean geometry.

The History Learning Site, 17 Mar 2015. 16 Aug 2016.  In November 1605, the infamous Gunpowder Plot took place in which some Catholics, most famously Guy Fawkes,\u00a0 plotted to blow up James I, the first of the Stuart kings of England. The story is remembered each November 5th when \u2018Guys\u2019 are burned in a celebration known as \u201cBonfire Night\u201d.  The story appears to be very simple.  Catholics in England had expected James to be more tolerant of them. In fact, he had proved to be the opposite and had ordered all Catholic priests to leave England. This so angered some Catholics that they decided to kill James and put his daughter Elizabeth on the throne ensuring that she was a Catholic. This led to a plot to kill not only the king of England, James, but also everyone sitting in the Houses of Parliament at the same time as James was there when he opened Parliament on November 5th, 1605.  Guy Fawkes and his fellow conspirators, having rented out a house right by the Houses of Parliament,\u00a0 managed to get 36 barrels of gunpowder into a cellar of the House of Lords.  The other conspirators were:  John Grant and the man who is said to have organised the whole plot  Robert Catesby.  The most famous picture of some the conspirators  The explosive expert, Guy Fawkes, had been left in the cellars to set off the fuse. He was only caught when a group of guards decided to check the cellars at the last moment.  Fawkes was arrested and sent to the Tower of London where he was tortured and eventually gave away the names of the fellow conspirators.\u00a0  Sir William Wade, Lieutenant of the Tower, had orders to use whatever means of torture was required to get information from Fawkes. The order came from James.\u00a0  Of those involved, some were shot as they were chased by the law such as Percy and Catesby. Others were captured, sent to the Tower and, after a brief trial, eventually hung, drawn and quartered, with Fawkes, in January 1606.\u00a0  \u00a0  The signature of Guy Fawkes on his confession  In celebration of his survival, James ordered that the people of England should have a great bonfire in the night on November 5th. This fire was traditionally topped off with an effigy of the pope rather than Guy Fawkes. His place at the top of the fire came in later as did fireworks. The East Sussex county town of Lewes still has the pope alongside Guy Fawkes when it comes to the effigies being burned.  But is there more to this plot than just a small number of angry Catholics wanting to make a statement against the king, James? Some believe that the whole plot was a government conspiracy to convince James that Catholics could not be trusted. At the very least, some curious things happened when the story is looked at in detail.  What is odd?  We do know that James\u2019 chief minister, Robert Cecil, the Earl of Salisbury, hated Catholics and saw them as a constant source of trouble. Cecil also feared that there was a chance that James would be lenient\u00a0 with them during his reign and this he could not tolerate.  That James only expelled priests was not good enough for Cecil. He wanted to remove Catholicism from England as he saw it as a threat.  We know that James was terrified of a violent death; his childhood in Scotland had been fraught with danger including being kidnapped as a boy. What better way to get James to severely persecute the Catholics in England than to get him to believe that they had tried to kill him in this very violent manner?  The government had a monopoly on gunpowder in this country and it was stored in places like the Tower of London.

The two parts are separated by c.400 mi (640 km) of the South China Sea.  West Malaysia is bordered on the north by Thailand, on the east by the South China Sea, on the south by Singapore (separated by the narrow Johore Strait), and on the west by the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea. East Malaysia is bordered on the north by the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, on the east by the Celebes Sea, and on the south and west by Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). Along the coast within Sarawak is the independent nation of Brunei. Both East and West Malaysia have mountainous interiors and coastal plains. The highest point is Mt. Kinabalu (13,455 ft/4,101 m) in Sabah. The longest of the country's many rivers are the Rajang (c.350 mi/560 km) in Sarawak, the Kinabatangan (c.350 mi/560 km) in Sabah, and the Pahang (c.200 mi/320 km) in West Malaysia. Lying close to the equator, Malaysia has a tropical rainy climate. Over two thirds of the land area is forested.  Although it makes up only 31% of the country's area, West Malaysia has more than 80% of its people. Of the total population, most of which is concentrated on the west coast, some 50% are ethnically Malay, almost 25% are Chinese, over 10% are of indigenous descent, and about 7% are South Asian (mainly Tamil). In West Malaysia, Malays comprise about one half of the population, Chinese one third, and South Asians one tenth. In East Malaysia, the two largest groups are the Chinese and the Ibans (Sea Dyaks), an indigenous people, who together make up about three fifths of the total. Conflict between the ethnic groups, particularly between Malays and Chinese, has played a large role in Malaysian history, and recent years have seen increased tension between ethnic Malays and people of South Asian descent.  Nearly all of the Malays are Sunni Muslims (they are considered to be Muslim under the constitution), and Islam is the national religion. The majority of Chinese are Buddhists (Confucianism and Taoism are also practiced), and most of the South Asians are Hindu; 9% of the population is Christian. The official language is Bahasa Malaysia (Malay), although English is used in the legal system.

{"input": "Question: What sort of plants belong to the genus Ilex? </s> Context: Introduction to the Aquifoliaceae - ucmp.berkeley.eduIntroduction to the Aquifoliaceae  Introduction to the Aquifoliaceae  The Hollies  The Aquifoliaceae are a group of about 400 species of primitive asterid flowering plants .  Nearly all of these species belong to the genus Ilex, commonly known  as the hollies.  Most are evergreen trees or shrubs, though there are  deciduous species that lose their leaves seasonally. Most Americans and  Europeans are familiar with the spiny-leaved species Ilex aquifolium (English holly) or Ilex opaca (American holly), but it is actually  uncommon for hollies to produce spines on their leaves.  The Hollies : Above at left, the \"berries\" of Ilex verticillata.  The bright red fruits attract birds, who then disperse the seeds. At lower  left, male flowers of I. verticillata viewed under magnification.   The tiny white flowers are often overlooked.  At right, Ilex opaca, the  American holly.  Most species of holly are shrubs or small trees. (Click on any of the pictures above for a larger image).  Most hollies are pollinated by insects, usually bees . The flowers typically produce either pollen or  seeds, but not both, and these usually occur on separate plants.  The greenish or white flowers are produced  in small clusters and are not often noticed, though the fruits  which mature from the flowers are noticeable and often bright red. These bright red \"berries\" and glossy leaves of some holly species has  made them popular ornamental trees. Native peoples of North and South  America have been known to brew highly caffeinated teas from some species,  such as yerba mat\u00e9.  Fossil pollen from the genus Ilex (holly) is highly distinctive and  easy to recognize in the fossil record.  The oldest such pollen comes from  the earliest Upper Cretaceous of  southeastern Australia, though Cretaceous age holly pollen has also been found  in the nations of Gabon and Egypt in Africa, and from California.  By the Paleocene pollen from this group is  known from South America and Europe as well, making the Aquifoliaceae a very  widely distributed group at that time. The group is still common, and grows  on every continent except Antarctica. Most species occur in the tropics, and  the group is known for tolerating acidic soils.  Sources:  Jan Muller. 1981.

Plants Poisonous to Livestock - Animal Science - Cornell ...Plants Poisonous to Livestock - Animal Science - Cornell University  BRIEF: Are Burford holly berries poisonous?  QUESTION:  We have several large burford holly  plants with berries, on our church grounds.   We have been told that some holly berries are poisonous. Can you assist me in   defining whether burford holly berries are poisonous, toxic, etc., and to what   extent?  ANSWER:  I am kind of releuctant to say much about holly, because that common name is       applied to a lot of different kinds of plants from a variety of families. As        common as it is in the South, I am not familiar with the specific toxic             properties of Burford Holly, but I am going to assume that you have Ilex            cornuta 'Burfordii Nana'. Holly species (member of the genus Ilex) contain          caffeine, theophylline and related compounds as well as some toxic glycosides       that cause vomiting and gastrointestinal problems. At high doses, with some         species, the GI symptoms and CNS depressing effects of unknown principles can       out weigh the stimulatory effects of the caffeine-like compounds. You don't want    kids eating the holly berries - it is unlikely to kill them, but they will be       pretty sick.

ByInnocence he means that infants and children share in the divine, that they are in fact\u00a0part of God, and that they see with the eyes of God. For the child, everything aroundthem is beautiful and true. This Innocence is not the same as Ignorance, i.e. being tooyoung to know that the world can be a dark, threatening place. Their Innocence ismore like the innocence of Adam and Eve before they ate of the forbidden fruit andwere expelled from the Garden of Eden.As we grow up and leave childhood behind us, Experience teaches us that the worldnot only has beauty and truth, but also has a darker side, and that people can betainted with Hate, Envy, Jealousy, Fear, Poverty, Despair. This for Blake is the stateof Experience.Blake felt that we all, as adults, must accept that the world of Experience exists, butthat we can get back to the Vision of Innocence that we had in our childhood. Howare we to do this?We regain our Innocence by the use of our Imagination. We use our CreativeImagination to remember what the World of Innocence is like, and that is the worldwe should try to live in. All our actions and behaviour and thoughts should reflect thekind of Innocence we want to regain \u2013 we should be kind and helpful and graciousand loving and considerate. And if we are artists we may recreate the Visions of\u00a0Innocence in paint, or in words, or in sculpture, or in any of the artistic media we can.William Blake is not being na\u00efve. His Songs of Experience show how familiar he waswith the harsh realties of life, but his Songs of Innocence show the kind of world weshould be struggling to build if we want to experience the joys of InnocenceRegained.This central idea \u2013 Innocence, Experience, and Innocence Regained \u2013 is reflected inBlake\u2019s poetry, and it is enlightening to study them in pairs, for example Infant Joy &Infant Sorrow. We should  not  see the poems as mirror opposites, but as the interplayof light and dark that is woven into the fabric of human life and its affairs.When studying the poems, keep this question before you at all times:  To what extent do these poems reflect William Blake\u2019s visionof the worlds of Innocence and Experience?2  \u00a0  FORM & LANGUAGE  Clearly we will need some knowledge of the form and language of Blake\u2019s poems,and this will be a main focus of our preparation during the weeks before theexamination.Remember, however, that your Study Guide has detailed comments on the form andlanguage of all the poems we are required to study.

He specialised in portraits of his contemporaries and ended up painting the governors and governesses of the almshouse where he spent his penniless old age.  Subject: An unknown young man. All we know - because it says so in the upper right-hand corner - is that he was 26 years old when Hals painted him.  Distinguishing features: The Laughing Cavalier looks out at us. His upward-pointing moustache, pointy beard, shiny nose, pink cheeks and his hat - a vast abstract black disc - give him an almost insufferable vivacity. Add to this the white ruff and that drape of velvet and he is half man, half silk. And there's something uncanny about him that has made this one of the most famous portraits in the world.  The Laughing Cavalier has been famous ever since the Victorian art collector Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, bought this previously uncelebrated, unvalued canvas by a then-forgotten painter at auction in 1865. The painting was simply called Portrait of a Man - it got its more flamboyant title afterwards.  What made it special in 19th-century eyes was its freely handled, spontaneous paint, its sense of being a snapshot taken in the midst of life. The speed with which it appears to have been painted appealed to the new sensibility of realism: Hals's painting style has a robustness that was exactly what Victorian painters were trying to achieve.  The rough reportage of Hals can be seen in every glob of white, grey or gold paint. The detail of the fine lace looks from a distance like absolute precision, but turns out to be a mobile sketch. The broad, angular lines of the Cavalier's arm and the sweep of the drapery over his belly appear (illusorily) as if they had been painted in a few seconds, rapidly sketched in long strokes. The body of the Cavalier, swathed in colours, is an amplification of basic brushstrokes; you can see how Hals brushed him into life. There's something excessive about that combination of rubicund face and masses of silk and lace. He's real and not real at the same time.  Dutch painters in the 17th century were representational: they painted the real world of burghers, their possessions, their neat houses. But these painters were also heirs to a tradition of the grotesque, the lowlands late-medieval art of Bosch and Brueghel. In this painting Hals hints at a fantastic underside to his art. The Laughing Cavalier is a man made visibly of paint. Rather than being about modern impressionistic truth, Hals's brushstrokes draw attention to the mechanics of illusion. This jolly, hearty character sharing a joke with the painter seems almost overbearingly real, yet Hals made him in the studio. Like the surreal fantasy assemblage portraits of the 16th-century painter Arcimboldo, the Laughing Cavalier has been created by Hals out of something inanimate. Perhaps that's the joke he is sharing with the artist, leaving us charmed yet slightly disconcerted - feeling that it is we who are being laughed at.  Inspirations and influences: Hals appealed to modern painters because he removed the smooth surfaces of classic art, reducing reality to brushstrokes. You can see echoes in the broad strokes of Manet and his followers, the Impressionists. James McNeill Whistler emulated Hals in his Arrangement in Flesh Colour and Black: Portrait of Th\u00e9odore Duret, c1883.  Another admirer was Van Gogh, who saw in his Dutch forerunner the expressive sensuality of his own Self-Portrait (1889).  Where is it?

Peter O\u2019Sullevan: the Voice of Racing who described the sport\u2019s legends  Read more  O\u2019Sullevan\u2019s commentaries on many of the most famous moments in racing, including Red Rum\u2019s third Grand National success in 1977, Dawn Run\u2019s Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1986 and Desert Orchid\u2019s win in the same race in 1989, are part of the sport\u2019s collective memory, familiar even to fans who were not born when the races were run.  O\u2019Sullevan was also an award-winning journalist for the Daily Express, where he worked for many years, and a winning owner in major races on the Flat and over jumps. He also founded a charitable foundation which raised millions for racing and animal charities. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad day in racing,\u201d said Jim McGrath, who took over as the BBC\u2019s main racing commentator following O\u2019Sullevan\u2019s retirement in 1997.  \u201cHe was a great, great man. He had a complete understanding and appreciation of exactly what was happening on the racecourse. He had an appreciation of the racehorse itself and also the jockeys, the participants involved and every layer of preparation that went into getting a horse to the racecourse. He could identify it and appreciate it and I think that came out in his commentaries.  \u201cI think racing has been very lucky to have a man that was so passionate about the sport able to eloquently convey everything that was good about it to the outside world.\u201d  Jimmy Lindley, a leading Flat jockey who later worked with O\u2019Sullevan at the BBC, said \u201che doesn\u2019t just compare with the great people in racing but in life in general\u201d. Lindley added: \u201cAs a commentator, no one else could give you the same feeling watching a race. He made it feel as if you were riding in it. You felt like you were on the horse yourself.\u201d  Another former jockey and colleague, Willie Carson, added: \u201cI always remember in the days when racing was on the evening news, they\u2019d show the last furlong of the classics. You\u2019d switch the TV on and it would be Peter giving the commentary. You\u2019d be listening to Sir Peter\u2019s dulcet, velvet tones giving the commentary. It was lovely.

This sage advice, \u201cMake sure you sell a poor quality horse far away from home,\" can be taken literally. We could also take it to mean something like, \u201cIf you need to behave badly, do it away from home.  Como un caballo en una cacharrer\u00eda. Literally, \u201clike a horse in a china shop,\" this is the Spanish counterpart to the English \u201clike a bull in a china shop.\" The meaning is the same, but the animals are different.  Dar un gallo para recebir un caballo.

Entrada de caballo y salida de burro. Translating to \u201centering on horseback and leaving on a burro,\" this tongue-in-cheek expression refers to never starting something you cannot finish.  Meterse entre las patas de los caballos. This means \u201cto put oneself under the horses\u2019 feet,\" which implies getting out of one\u2019s depth.  A matacaballo.

The son of a administrator in a reform school, Paulus attempted to become an officer-cadet in the German Navy but was rejected because of his lack of aristocratic blood. After briefly studying law at the University of Munich he joined the German Army in 1910. The following year he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Baden Infantry Regiment.  On the outbreak of the First World War Paulus was adjutant of the III Battalion. In 1915 he was assigned to the staff of the 2nd Prussian Jaeger Regiment and two years later to the operations staff of the Alpine Corps. During the war he served on the Eastern Front and the Western Front .  Paulus remained in the army after the war and was appointed adjutant to the 14th Infantry Regiment at Konstanz. In 1922 he was given general staff training and the following year joined Army Group 2 at Kassel. From 1924 to 1927 he was a General Staff officer with Wehrkreis V at Stuttgart. One senior officer commented that Paulus was: \"slow, but very methodical\". Another complained that he \"lacked decisiveness\". However, he continued to be promoted and in 1930 he became a tactics instructor with the 5th Infantry Division.  In 1934 Paulus was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and appointed commander of Motor Transport Section 3. In September 1935, Paulus succeeded Heinz Guderian as chief of staff to the commander of Germany's Mechanized Forces. Considered to be an expert on motorized warfare, Paulus was promoted to major general and became director of training for Germany's four light divisions in 1939. This included two motorized infantry regiments, a reconnaissance regiment and a motorized artillery regiment.  Just before the outbreak of the Second World War Paulus became chief of staff of the 10th Army. Serving under General Walther von Reichenau , Paulus took part in the invasion of Poland in September 1939. This was followed by the Western Offensive in Belgium and France .  In June 1940, Paulus was promoted to lieutenant general and three months later became deputy chief of the General Staff. He visited General Erwin Rommel in North Africa on a fact-finding tour. His report was highly critical of Rommel and the Deutsches Afrika Korps but this was not acted upon by Adolf Hitler .  Paulus then carried out a strategic survey on the Soviet Union for the proposed Operation Barbarossa . The main advice given by Paulus to Hitler was to make sure that after the invasion the Red Army did not retreat into the interior. For the campaign to be successful he argued for battles of encirclement. He also suggested that the main thrust should be made north of the Pripyat Marshes in order to capture Moscow .  In December, 1941, Hitler agreed to the suggestion made by Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau that Paulus should be given command of the 6th Army. Promoted to general, Paulus took up his appointment on 1st January 1942 and fought his first battle at Dnepropetrovsk in the Soviet Union . The advance of the 6th Army was halted by the Red Army and the following month Paulus was forced to order his men to move back in search of better defensive positions.  On 9th May 1942, General Semen Timoshenko , with 640,000 men, attacked the 6th Army at Volchansk. Paulus, seriously outnumbered, decided to move his troops back toward Kharkov. The 6th Army was rescued by General Paul von Kleist and his 1st Panzer Army when they struck Timoshenko's exposed southern flank on 17th May. Paulus was now able to launch a counter-attack on 20th May and by the end of the month all Soviet resistance had come to an end. A total of 240,000 Soviet soldiers were killed or captured and Paulus was awarded the Knights' Cross.  In the summer of 1942 Paulus advanced toward Stalingrad with 250,000 men, 500 tanks, 7,000 guns and mortars, and 25,000 horses.

{"input": "Question: What is the acronym referring to a scale of readiness in the US military, derived from 'defense readiness condition'? </s> Context: DEFCONThe defense readiness condition (DEFCON) is an alert state used by the United States Armed Forces.   The DEFCON system was developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and unified and specified combatant commands.    It prescribes five graduated levels of readiness (or states of alert) for the U.S. military. It increases in severity from DEFCON 5 (least severe) to DEFCON 1 (most severe) to match varying military situations.  DEFCONs are a subsystem of a series of Alert Conditions, or LERTCONs, which also include Emergency Conditions (EMERGCONs).   Operations  The DEFCON level is controlled primarily by the U.S. President and the U.S. Secretary of Defense through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders, and each DEFCON level defines specific security, activation and response scenarios for the troops in question.  Different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces (i.e. U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard) and different bases or command groups can be activated at different defense conditions. In general, there is no single DEFCON status for the world or country and it may be set to only include specific geographical areas. According to Air & Space/Smithsonian, as of 2014, the worldwide DEFCON level has never risen higher than DEFCON 3. The DEFCON 2 levels in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and 1991 Gulf War were not worldwide.   There is no single DEFCON status for the country, and in fact different branches of the military  in different geographic locations can be at separate defense readiness conditions at the same time. DEFCONs should not be confused with similar systems used by the U.S. military, such as Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS), Readiness Conditions (REDCONS), Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) and its future replacement Cyber Operations Condition (CYBERCON),  and Watch Conditions (WATCHCONS), or the former Homeland Security Advisory System used by the United States Department of Homeland Security.  Levels  Defense readiness conditions vary between many commands and have changed over time,  and the United States Department of Defense uses exercise terms when referring to the DEFCONs.  This is to preclude the possibility of confusing exercise commands with actual operational commands. On 12 January 1966, NORAD \"proposed the adoption of the readiness conditions of the JCS system\", and information about the levels was declassified in 2006:  History  After NORAD was created, the command used different readiness levels (Normal, Increased, Maximum) subdivided into eight conditions, e.g., the \"Maximum Readiness\" level had two conditions \"Air Defense Readiness\" and \"Air Defense Emergency\".  In October 1959, the JCS Chairman informed NORAD \"that Canada and the U. S. had signed an agreement on increasing the operational readiness of NORAD forces during periods of international tension.\"  After the agreement became effective on 2 October 1959, the JCS defined a system with DEFCONs in November 1959 for the military commands. The initial DEFCON system had \"Alpha\" and \"Bravo\" conditions (under DEFCON3) and Charlie/Delta under DEFCON4, plus an \"Emergency\" level higher than DEFCON1 with two conditions:  \"Defense Emergency\" and the highest, \"Air Defense Emergency\" (\"Hot Box\" and \"Big Noise\" for exercises).  DEFCON 2  Cuban Missile Crisis  During the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 22, 1962, the U.S. Armed Forces (with the exception of United States Army Europe (USAREUR)) were ordered to DEFCON 3. On October 24, Strategic Air Command (SAC) was ordered to DEFCON 2, while the rest of the U.S. Armed Forces remained at DEFCON 3. SAC remained at DEFCON 2 until November 15.   Gulf War  On January 15, 1991, the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared DEFCON 2 in the opening phase of Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War.  US Secretary of State James Baker had warned that Iraqi chemical weapon use against coalition forces would result in nuclear retaliation.

He has lived in County Durham since 1960.   Early life  Bellamy went to school in London, attending Chatsworth Road Primary School Cheam, Cheam Road Junior School and Sutton County Grammar School, where he initially showed an aptitude for English Literature and History; he then found his vocation because of an inspirational science teacher, studying at faculty of Biological Sciences: Zoology, Botany, Physics and Chemistry in the sixth form.  After he left school he worked as a laboratory assistant at Ewell Technical College  before studying for an Honours degree in Botany at Chelsea College of Science and Technology. In 1960 he became a lecturer in the Botany department of Durham University.   Career  He first came to public prominence as an environmental consultant at the time of the 1967 Torrey Canyon oil spill;  he wrote Effects of Pollution from the Torrey Canyon on Littoral and Sublittoral Ecosystems, which was published in Nature [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967Natur.216.1170B]. He has written and presented some 400 television programmes on botany, ecology, and environmental issues. Bellamy is the originator, along with David Shreeve and the Conservation Foundation (which he also founded), of the Ford European Conservation Awards and has published scientific papers (between 1966 and 1986) and many books.  Television   During the early 1980s he was a popular presenter of television programmes, including Bellamy's Backyard Safari.[http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/301/Down+the+Garden+Path.html Bellamy's Backyard Safari at Wild Film History]. Retrieved 1 July 2014 He was parodied by Lenny Henry on Tiswas with a \"grapple me grapenuts\" catchphrase. He once lent his distinctive voice to an advert for the blackcurrant drink Ribena, which claimed that 95% of British blackcurrants were used in Ribena. (This has now been changed to \"Nearly all British blackcurrants are used in Ribena\".)  During the 1980s he replaced Big Chief I-Spy as the figurehead of the I-Spy range of children's books, to whom completed books were sent to get a reward. In 1980 he released a single written by Mike Croft with musical arrangement by Dave Grosse to coincide with the release of the I-Spy title I Spy Dinosaurs, a title exploring the subject of dinosaur fossils, entitled \"Brontosaurus Will You Wait For Me?\" (backed with \"Oh Stegasaurus\"). He performed it on Blue Peter wearing an orange jump suit. It reached number 88 in the charts.   Activism   In 1983 he was jailed for blockading the Australian Franklin River in a protest against a proposed dam. On 18 August 1984, he leapt from the pier at St. Abbs Harbour into the North Sea. In the process he officially opened Britain's first Voluntary Marine Reserve, the St. Abbs and Eyemouth Voluntary Marine Reserve.

{"input": "Question: In which English country is the country house Dorneywood? </s> Context: English country houseAn English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside. Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house. This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the city\u2014hence, for these people, the term distinguished between town and country. However, the term also encompasses houses that were, and often still are, the full-time residence for the landed gentry. These people were central to the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832.  Frequently, the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses.  With large numbers of indoor and outdoor staff, country houses were important as places of employment for many rural communities. In turn, until the agricultural depressions of the 1870s, the estates, of which country houses were the hub, provided their owners with incomes. However, the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the swan song of the traditional English country house lifestyle. Increased taxation and the effects of World War I led to the demolition of hundreds of houses; those that remained had to adapt to survive.  While a ch\u00e2teau or a schloss can be a fortified or unfortified building, a country house is usually unfortified. If fortified, it is called a castle, but not all that are named that way are fortified (for example Highclere Castle).  Stately homes of England  The term stately home is subject to debate and indifferent use, and avoided by historians and other academics. As a description of a country house, the term was first used in a poem by Felicia Hemans, The Homes of England, originally published in Blackwood's Magazine in 1827. In the 20th century, the term was later popularised in a song by No\u00ebl Coward,  and in modern usage it often implies a country house that is open to visitors at least some of the time.  In England, the terms \"country house\" and \"stately home\" are sometimes used vaguely and interchangeably; however, many country houses such as Ascott in Buckinghamshire were deliberately designed not to be stately, and to harmonise with the landscape, while some of the great houses such as Kedleston Hall and Holkham Hall were built as \"power houses\" to dominate the landscape, and were most certainly intended to be \"stately\" and impressive.  In his book Historic Houses: Conversations in Stately Homes, the author and journalist Robert Harling documents nineteen \"stately homes\"; these range in size from the vast Blenheim palace to the minuscule Ebberston Hall, and in architecture from the Jacobean Renaissance of Hatfield House to the eccentricities of Sezincote. The book's collection of stately homes also includes George IV's Brighton town palace, the Royal Pavilion.   Evolution   The country houses of England have evolved over the last five hundred years. Before this time, larger houses were usually fortified, reflecting the position of their owners as feudal lords, de facto overlords of their manors.  The Tudor period of stability in the country saw the building of the first of the unfortified great houses. Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries saw many former ecclesiastical properties granted to the King's favourites, who then converted them into private country houses. Woburn Abbey, Forde Abbey and many other mansions with abbey or priory in their name became private houses during this period. Other terms used in the names of houses to describe their origin or importance include palace, castle, court, hall, mansion, park, house, manor, and place.  It was during the second half of the reign of Elizabeth I, and under her successor, James I, that the first architect-designed mansions, thought of today as epitomising the English country house, began to make their appearance.  Burghley House, Longleat House, and Hatfield House are among the best known examples of the showy prodigy house, often built with the intention of attracting the monarch to visit.  By the reign of Charles I, Inigo Jones and his form of Palladianism had changed the face of English domestic architecture completely, with the use of turrets and towers as an architectural reference to the earlier castles", "truth": ["buckinghamshire"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4773", "mistake": "English", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

Sark lies 7 miles (11 km) east of Guernsey and about 25 miles (40 km) west of the Cherbourg Peninsula of France. The island , which is 3 miles (5 km) long and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide at its broadest point, consists of two components, Great Sark and Little Sark, which are connected by La Coup\u00e9e (a 300-foot- [90-metre-] long isthmus that is only about 30 feet [10 metres] wide). The smaller, privately owned island of Brecqhou (Brechou) is separated from Great Sark by the narrow Le Gouliot Channel. Sark is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The island is essentially a plateau rising to 375 feet (114 metres), with a scenic coast encircled by precipitous cliffs. The island has three small harbours: Creux, La Maseline, and Havre Gosselin.  La Coup\u00e9e isthmus connecting Great Sark and Little Sark, Sark island.  Angus MacRae  Apart from legends of St. Magloire (6th century), Sark first appears in history as a gift by William of Normandy (later William I , the Conqueror) to the Mont-Saint-Michel abbey about 1040. A century later it was in the hands of the Vernon family, lords of N\u00e9hou, who endowed the priory of St. Magloire as a dependency of the abbey of Montebourg. Sark reverted to the English crown in 1204 by Richard de Vernon\u2019s forfeiture. Sark was governed by a royal provost who presided over a court of six jurats (magistrates chosen for life). The island was captured by the French in 1549 but was in English hands again by 1558. Thereafter, it remained under English control, except for a period of German occupation during World War II .  To prevent the island from becoming a nest of pirates, it was colonized by H\u00e9lier de Carteret, seigneur of St. Ouen in Jersey , under a patent of Elizabeth I (Aug. 6, 1565). At first the court was modeled on that of Jersey, with bailiff and jurats, but this was changed in 1675 to one composed of seneschal , provost, greffier, tenants, seigneur, constable , and vingtenier. By 1951 the members were reduced to seigneur, seneschal, tenants, and 12 deputies. The Carterets were seigneurs until 1732, after which the seigneury changed hands several times. From 1927 until 1974 it was held by the dame of Sark, Sibyl Hathaway; on her death she was succeeded by her son Michael Beaumont as 22nd seigneur.

{"input": "Question: The translation of Persian poems called The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam was the work of which 19th century English writer and poet? </s> Context: The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam by Edward FitzGeraldThe Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam by Edward FitzGerald - Telegraph  The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam by Edward FitzGerald  Tony Briggs looks back at Edward FitzGerald's translation of The Rubaiyat of    Omar Khayyam  By Tony Briggs  6:00AM BST 18 Apr 2009  This year marks the bicentenary of the birth of Edward FitzGerald, an outstanding writer who has done more than anyone to popularise English poetry. His best-known work, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859), began by being remaindered as a penny pamphlet, but it soon took off and swept across the world. To date it has appeared in 650 different editions, with illustrations by 150 artists. It has been translated into 70 languages and set to music by 100 composers.  Edward FitzGerald  More importantly, it has been enjoyed by thousands of readers, and has been memorised and widely quoted. A correspondent of mine recently described how his father learnt the whole poem, stanza by stanza, as a prisoner in a Japanese camp; another\u2019s father did the same in a Rangoon outpost.  Learning this poem was nothing unusual then. Two generations ago every educated person could have continued from memory any of these lines from The Rubaiyat:  \u201cAwake, for Morning in the Bowl of Night \u2026  A Book of Verses underneath the Bough \u2026  The Moving Finger Writes; and, having writ \u2026  Myself when young did eagerly frequent \u2026  Ah, Moon of my Delight that know\u2019st no wane \u2026\u201d  But something has gone wrong. FitzGerald, far from being recognised as a leading poet, has been disregarded by the literary establishment. There could be several reasons for this. Has the poem proved too popular for its own good? Is it perhaps lightweight doggerel quickly seen through by experts? Does its origin (in translation) invalidate it as an independent work? Is The Rubaiyat affected by the way poetry is taught nowadays, with a ban on learning anything by heart?  None of these reasons has any validity. Laurence Housman saw the dangers of popular acclaim and worried that The Rubaiyat might be \u201cacceptable to all but scholars and pedants\u201d.  The academic world tends to be suspicious of anything that is widely enjoyed, which may be why there is no single monograph devoted to this poet. A recent study of English poetry ran to nearly 1,000 pages and 1,000 poets without even mentioning The Rubaiyat.  Let no one assume that the poetry of The Rubaiyat is of slender value and achievement. These verses are highly accomplished. The stanza alone, called rubai in the original Persian, is an astonishing innovation in English poetry. Who would have believed that the most common of all our poetic forms could have been reinvented as late as the mid-19th century?  Admittedly it is borrowed from another culture, but the asymmetrical quatrain, rhyming aaba, was adapted and individualised by FitzGerald. The last line (instead of completing the expected aabb sequence) loops back and adds another rhyme to the opening couplet, creating a frisson that sharpens the end of every stanza, even when you know it is coming. And the rhymes themselves are so discreet that it is easy to overlook how adept they are at not rhyming similar parts of speech.  FitzGerald\u2019s poem is an elegant day-long meditation on life, death, happiness and the pleasures of imbibing. The carpe diem theme has never been more succinctly or movingly expressed than in this gem of a stanza: \u201cA Book of Verses underneath the Bough, / A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread \u2013 and Thou / Beside me singing in the Wilderness \u2013 / O Wilderness were Paradise enow!\u201d  Note the unusual rhymes; note the list of essentials for paradise \u2013 poetry, nature, food and wine, company (including love and sex no doubt) and music \u2013 a more satisfying catalogue than the celebrity, riches and power that are the aspirations of today.  In addition to this, the poem stirs up a delicious blend of English in different forms: colloquial speech, archaisms, exclamations, asides, superb and exotic metaphors (some of them extended), direct speech, apostrophe, rhetorical", "truth": ["edward fitzgerald"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2724", "mistake": "Edward FitzGerald", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

Mars in Roman mythology, the god of war and the most important Roman god after Jupiter. He was probably originally an agricultural god, and the month of March is named after him. His Greek equivalent is Ares . Legends of Mars include the story of his love for Venus, and the trap made for them by her husband Vulcan, and from early times this became a favourite subject for artists. The wolf and the woodpecker were regarded as sacred to Mars, and the field of Mars is another name for the Campus Martius of ancient Rome . The hill of Mars is the Areopagus (\u2018hill of Ares\u2019) of ancient Athens .  Mars is the name given to a small reddish planet which is the fourth in order from the sun and is periodically visible to the naked eye. From its distinctive colour, which comes from its iron-rich minerals, it is known informally as the red planet. In astrological belief, the influence of the planet is associated with combative, aggressive, or masculine qualities.  Cite this article  Mars (in Roman religion and mythology)  The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.  Copyright The Columbia University Press  Mars, in Roman religion and mythology, god of war. In early Roman times he was a god of agriculture, but in later religion (when he was identified with the Greek Ares ) he was primarily associated with war. Mars was the father of Romulus, the founder of the Roman nation, and, next to Jupiter, he enjoyed the highest position in Roman religion. The Salii, his priests, honored him by dancing in full armor in the Campus Martius, the site of his altar. Chariot races and the sacrifice of animals were primary features of the festivals held in his honor in March (named for him) and October. Mars was represented as an armed warrior. His attributes include the spear and shield, and the wolf and woodpecker were sacred to him. He was frequently associated with Bellona, the Roman goddess of war.  Cite this article  Myths and Legends of the World  COPYRIGHT 2001 Macmillan Reference, USA  Mars  Mars was a major Roman deity, second only to Jupiter* in the Roman pantheon. He began as a protector of agriculture but later became the god of war, honored throughout the realm of the conquering Romans. The Romans admired Greek culture and absorbed Greek deities into their own. They came to identify their own war god, Mars, with the Greek war god, Ares, but Mars was a more dignified and popular figure.  According to legend, Juno, the queen of the gods, gave birth to Mars after being touched by a magic plant. He was originally associated with vegetation and fertility. As the Romans became increasingly warlike, Mars gradually developed into a god of war, but he never lost his connection with agriculture and the plant world entirely. The Romans honored him with festivals in his month, March, which occurs at a time of the year when new growth begins in the fields and military campaigns resume after a winter break.  Mars's high place of honor in the Roman pantheon comes in part from his role as an ancestor of Rome . According to the story of the founding of Rome, Mars was the father of Romulus and Remus, twin boys born to a human priestess and raised by a wolf. Romulus later founded the city of Rome, and the Romans believed that Romulus's divine father would come to their aid in times of crisis or disaster. The wolf and the woodpecker, animals involved in the saving of the twins, were sacred to Mars. Picus, a Roman god who took the form of a woodpecker, was Mars's companion.  One story about Mars relates that the god's sacred shield had fallen from the sky in the time of the early Roman king Numa Pompilius.

It was he who commissioned the Arc de Triomphe. Napoleon started his career as a private in the army and quickly rose through the ranks because of his intelligence and ability to command. His men greatly respected his leadership and his decisions.  As a General, Napoleon led the French army against most of the other countries in Europe. When he became Emperor of France, he continued to lead his armies successfully in Europe and in Egypt, winning nearly every battle. It was Emperor Napoleon who wanted to construct a monument to commemorate his victorious armies and the conquests of France during his reign.  Napoleon's run of luck came to an end after his misjudged invasion of Russia in 1812. This was a failure and hundreds of thousands of French soldiers died in the cold. During his last battle,  at Waterloo in 1815, he was captured by British and Prussian (German) allies. He was exiled to a lonely island, St Helena, in the South Atlantic where he died a sad, solitary man, a few years later.  Why the Arc de Triomphe was built.  Napoleon Bonparte was a very successful soldier-Emperor who conquered most of Europe during the early nineteenth century.  He considered how he could construct a monument which would help people to remember, not only him, but also the conquests his armies had achieved and their bravery in the battles that they had fought. During his travels, Napoleon had seen and admired the triumphal arches built by the Romans eighteen hundred years before. These Roman triumphal arches were constructed for victorious Roman Emperors who paraded  through the arch with all their troops,  captives and spoils of war after successful campaigns.  Napoleon rather liked this idea. He oversaw the design and ordered the Arch to be built in 1806. It was designed to be a landmark in the capital city. It was meant to be the part of the Triumphal way from Versailles into Paris, leading through to the Louvre, which was the ancient palace of the French kings. But before it had risen many metres above ground level, the architect died (in 1811).  This, combined with Napoleon's military failures in his last few years as Emperor, meant that the Arch was never completed while Napoleon was alive. He never saw his dream become a reality and was never able to use it!  The Arc de Triomphe was  not completed until 1836, many years after Napoleon's death.  Visiting the Arc de Triomphe.  Around the Arc de Triomphe is the Place Charles de Gaulle. Charles de Gaulle was a hero and President of France. Place Charles de Gaulle  is a huge roundabout, many lanes wide. It used to be known as the \"Place de L'\u00c9toile\", or \"Star\". This is because, from this roundabout, twelve avenues reach into the distance, forming an elegant twelve pointed \"star\". When Baron Haussmann re-designed the centre of Paris, he wanted the Arc de Triomphe to be the focus point from as many places as possible and the central destination to which the most important roads led.  To reach the Arch, you need to take the subway passage under the roundabout. The roundabout has the reputation of being one of the most difficult to navigate in France because of the traffic.  The Arc de Triomphe is free for every one to visit. However, if you want to climb to the top, you have to purchase a ticket. Be prepared for a long climb up the steep spiral staircase!

(The film was loosely inspired by the 1932 film Scarface: The Shame of a Nation, which starred Paul Muni as blood-crazy gangster Tony Camonte. That film, in turn, was loosely inspired by the life of real-life mobster Al Capone , who was nicknamed Scarface.) The 1983 film, directed by Brian DePalma and written by Oliver Stone , was a modest hit when first released. However, it gained cult status in the 1990s and early 2000s thanks to its popularity with hip-hop stars and other young movie fans. This second generation of fans seemed captivated by the movie's rags-to-riches theme, along with Al Pacino's over-the-top performance and the film's absurd levels of violence and tough talk.

Scarface Movie Review & Film Summary (1983) | Roger EbertScarface Movie Review & Film Summary (1983) | Roger Ebert  Tweet  The interesting thing is the way Tony Montana stays in the memory, taking on the dimensions of a real, tortured person. Most thrillers use interchangeable characters, and most gangster movies are more interested in action than personality, but \"Scarface\" is one of those special movies, like \" The Godfather ,\" that is willing to take a flawed, evil man and allow him to be human. Maybe it's no coincidence that Montana is played by Al Pacino , the same actor who played Michael Corleone.  Advertisement  Montana is a punk from Cuba. The opening scene of the movie informs us that when Cuban refugees were allowed to come to America in 1981, Fidel Castro had his own little private revenge -- and cleaned out his prison cells, sending us criminals along with his weary and huddled masses. We see Montana trying to bluff his way through an interrogation by US federal agents, and that's basically what he'll do for the whole movie: bluff. He has no real character and no real courage, although for a short time cocaine gives him the illusion of both.  \"Scarface\" takes its title from the 1932 Howard Hawks movie, which was inspired by the career of Al Capone. That Hawks film was the most violent gangster film of its time, and this 1983 film by Brian DePalma also has been surrounded by a controversy over its violence, but in both movies the violence grows out of the lives of the characters; it isn't used for thrills but for a sort of harrowing lesson about self-destruction. Both movies are about the rise and fall of a gangster, and they both make much of the hero's neurotic obsession with his sister, but the 1983 \"Scarface\" isn't a remake, and it owes more to \"The Godfather\" than to Hawks.  That's because it sees its criminal so clearly as a person with a popular product to sell, working in a society that wants to buy. In the old days it was booze. For the Corleones, it was gambling and prostitution. Now it's cocaine. The message for the dealer remains the same: Only a fool gets hooked on his own goods.

{"input": "Question: Against which state did Athens fight the 'Peloponnesian Wars'? </s> Context: Ancient Greece - Persian, Peloponnesian, Spartan, Greek WarsAncient Greece - Persian, Peloponnesian, Spartan, Greek Wars  The Peloponnesian War ( 431 - 404 B.C )  The War fought between the two leading city-states in ancient Greece, Athens and Sparta.  Description:  The Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.) took place between the Athenian empire and Peloponnesian league lead by the Spartans. The Peloponnesian league was a coalition of the Thebes, Corinth and Sparta.  The war was divided into 3 phases: The Archidamian War, The Sicilian war and The Ionian or Decelean War: phase. The war commenced on 4 April 431 B.C. when the Thebans launched a surprise attack on Plataea, who as a partner of Athens. The war ended on 25 April 404 B.C. when Athens surrendered.  The Peloponnesian War remodeled the entire Greek state. The Athenian empire, which was a stronger side prior to the war, was reduced to a mere vulnerable slave of Sparta. After the war, Sparta was the ruling state of Greece. The war destroyed the economies and brought poverty and sufferings to the state. Athens could never gain its lost prosperity that it was proud of, pre-war.  Reasons:  The main reason for the launch of the war was the Spartan fear of Athens's growing power and prosperity. Athens rule over most of the Mediterranean region along with Greece/Hellas, 50 years preceding the war, instigated the war.  According to Thucydides, that after Athens became the leader of the Delian League, they became the supreme power known as the Athenian Empire. They nearly drove out the Persians from their regions of Aegean and occupied supremacy over a large number of territories. Athens naval power was also growing day-by-day endangering the bordering states.  During the Persian war in 480 BC, Athens power had grown by leaps and bounds and with the help of its allies continued its attacks on the Persian territories of Ionia and Aegean. Athens also constructed walls around its empire to save them from Spartan land attack, when the Persians fled Greece. This enraged the Spartans, who took no action at that time.  In 459 BC Athens took advantage between the Megara and Corinth war siding with Megara. This helped them gain a foothold on the Isthmus of Corinth. This resulted in a war, known as the 'The First Peloponnesian War' fought between Athens and Sparta, Corinth, Aegean and other states. At the end of the war, however, Athens backed out from Greek mainland, due to an enormous attack by the Spartans. A thirty years treaty was signed between Athens and Sparta in 446 BC.  Uproar Starts:  The Thirty Years peace treaty weathered its first experience when Samos, an Athens ally, rebelled. At that time a Spartan interference, could have resulted into a huge war, but the Spartans along with its allies decided not to intervene. The revolt was crushed.  The second reason of the war was, after Athens made an alliance with Corcyra, Rhegium and Leontini, the naval power in un-destroyable. Corcyra was Corinth's enemy. This endangered food supply to the region to the Peloponnese city. Regarding this point, the Peloponnesian War was a trade war. The Corinth, encouraged the Spartans to take up arms, backed by Megara and Aegean who had unwillingly became an Athenian ally.  Further instigation was strict sanctions Megara, in spite of being an Athens ally. These sanctions forbade Megara of having any economic transactions with Athens. Known as the Megarian decree this was the last straw, and became a major contributing factor in the war.

Had the best song,best props,most memorable voice.Oh,and most distinctive walking style-with his hands at chest height and elbows pointing outwards making look him like Dick Van Dyke about to launch into a chorus of \"the old bamboo\".  Not that he ever did sadly.  ON THIS PAGE\u00a0-\u00a0everything except the songs,which I still need to add.  THE TRUMPTONSHIRE TRILOGY  CAMBERWICK GREEN,TRUMPTON and CHIGLEY  Like its 2 predecessors,Chigley had 13 x 15 minute episodes.  It was first broadcast on BBC 1 in the Watch With Mother lunchtime slot on October 6th,1969  and ran for 13 consecutive weeks.  Whilst all the initial broadcasts of Camberwick and Trumpton were in black and white,  Chigley's debut straddled the changeover to colour.So only the first few weeks were in monochrome. Although you did need to have a colour tv set and live in an area that was covered by a colour transmitter to benefit -which many didn't.  Chigley also had the slightly more dubious honour of being the last of the 3 series to have a full re-run on the BBC [1986]  Size-wise,it was the smallest of the 3 locations,being little more than a hamlet.Trumpton being a town and Camberwick a village.  And because of the sparser population,a lot of familiar characters from the first 2 series reappeared throughout,helping to beef it up and tie all 3 locations together as part of the County of Trumptonshire.  1  Belborough and Brackett enjoyed a very similar star/straight man relationship to that of the Trumpton Mayor and his town clerk,Mr.Troop.  Bilton was a much more peripheral character.  He only appeared in one episode (aside from being a passive onlooker).  But he's notable for being the\u00a0only\u00a0character in the whole of Trumptonshire to be given a noticeable accent.  Brian Cant normally just used varying degrees of intonation and pitch to differentiate one character from another.But he drew on his own Suffolk roots to give Bilton a distinct country lilt.Subtle rather than full-blown \"yokel\" and completely appropriate to the character.But still an unusual departure.  Belborough and Brackett were involved in the 3 main stock footage sequences in Chigley :-  The first was a well-used ploy to get the storyline running .......  Brackett takes a phone call requesting his Lordship's services in the train.And he lollops down a long,galleried corridor to either the study or library to pass on the message.  Very much shades of the Captain Falck phone call sequence in Trumpton. And the garish modern art depicted above the phone and along the corridor was very 1969,when the series was written of course.And probably more than a little inspired by Lord Bath's well-documented artistic endeavours at Longleat House.

{"input": "Question: What was Kerry Packer's media company called? </s> Context: Kerry PackerKerry Francis Bullmore Packer,  (17 December 1937 \u2013 26 December 2005) was an Australian media tycoon.  The Packer family company owned a controlling interest in both the Nine television network and leading Australian publishing company Australian Consolidated Press, which were later merged to form Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL). Outside Australia, Packer was best known for founding World Series Cricket. At the time of his death, Packer was the richest and one of the most influential men in Australia. In 2004, Business Review Weekly magazine estimated Packer's net worth at .  Kerry Packer was considered as one of Australia's most powerful media proprietors.   Early life  Kerry Packer was born Kerry Francis Bullmore Packer on 17 December 1937. His father was Sir Frank Packer, an Australian media proprietor who controlled Australian Consolidated Press and the Nine Network. His mother, Gretel Bullmore, was the daughter of Herbert Bullmore, the Scottish rugby union player. He had an older brother, Clyde Packer. He took part in various sports at school, including boxing, cricket, and rugby; though struggled academically, possibly due to undiagnosed dyslexia. On his father's death in 1974, the family estate, valued at $100 million, which included Australian Consolidated Press and the Nine Network, passed directly to Packer. His father had fallen out with his elder son, Clyde, in 1972.  Business  Packer was the first person to make money out of cricket by telecasting it in TV which created interest in people to watch cricket. Packer, through his family company Consolidated Press Holdings, was the major shareholder with a 37% holding in Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL). Until Packer's death PBL owned the Nine television network, and Australian Consolidated Press which produces many of Australia's top-selling magazines. He was involved in a number of other gambling and tourism ventures, notably Crown Casino in Melbourne. The Nine Network and Australian Consolidated Press businesses have since been divested to PBL Media.  Packer was widely respected in business circles, courted by politicians on both sides, and was widely regarded as one of the most astute businessmen of his time, despite having been a poor student.  Although Packer's reputation as an astute businessman was legendary and he made some good investments, he was by no means a self-made man \u2013 his grandfather Robert Clyde Packer and his father Sir Frank Packer had built up the media empire and its related holdings over many decades. As pointed out by internet news outlet Crikey if $100 million had been invested in the Australian sharemarket in September 1974 through a balanced portfolio of the top 200 companies, that portfolio would be worth a lot more than $6.9 billion in December 2005, possibly as much as $11 billion.   Moreover, Packer was not the first choice to take over the running of the family's business empire \u2013 his father had intended that Kerry's elder brother Clyde Packer would take over the company, but Clyde fell out with his father in the early 1970s and left Australia permanently.  Kerry's independent business life began after his father's death in 1974 when he inherited control of the family's controlling share in PBL, valued at . Further, his principal Australian investments in television and casinos were highly protected from competition by government regulation which Packer and his employees worked very hard to have maintained.  The Packer family's business reputation suffered a blow when One.Tel, a telephone company in which his son James Packer had invested, collapsed in 2001.  Kerry Packer was also one of Australia's largest landholders. In 2003 a deposit of rubies was discovered on one of his properties.

The remaining Eastern empire had a smaller territory than the original Roman Empire .  The Empire in trouble 476\u2013717 AD  Wars in the West  The Byzantine Empire tried to take back Rome and Italy from the Germans. Between 530\u2013555 AD, the Byzantines won many battles and took back Rome.  These gains did not last however. More Germans came and eventually Italy and Rome was lost again. Worse was to come when Avar and Slavic peoples came to take modern Bulgaria and Greece from the Byzantines. Gradually, after the 560s the invaders won much of the Balkans. These invaders were later followed by the Bulgarians. The Avars and Bulgarians were both Turkish peoples at first. They ruled over Slavic people called \"Sklavinai\" and slowly absorbed Slavic language and customs.  Wars in the East  After western Rome was captured by Germanic people, the Empire continued to control modern Egypt , Greece , Palestine , Syria and Turkey . However, another Empire, known as the Persian Empire, tried to take over these lands for itself. Between 224\u2013628 AD, the Romans and the Persians fought many battles, with many men killed in the fighting. Eventually, the Persians were finally defeated in modern-day Iraq , near the ancient city of Nineveh in 627 AD, allowing the Byzantines to keep their lands.  After this, another enemy appeared: the Arabs . The Byzantines were economically damaged by the battles with the Persians. They could not withstand the Arabs. Palestine, Syria and Egypt were lost between 635 and 645. However, the Byzantines defended Asia Minor (modern Turkey) and the Arab advance stopped.  Recovery of the Empire: 717\u20131025 AD  In 718 AD, the Arabs were defeated outside Constantinople, ending the Arab threat in the east, but leaving the Byzantine Empire severely weakened. In the west, the Byzantines launched a number of attacks against the Bulgarians. Some of these were successful, others were not and led to the deaths of many emperors. Over time, the Byzantine Empire would became weaker as it loss land to outside invaders.  Recovery in the west  Between 1007\u20131014, the ambitious Byzantine Emperor Basil II attacked Bulgaria many times and eventually won a great victory. Later, he fully recaptured Greece, adding it back to the Byzantine Empire. He then went on to conquer Bulgaria, which was completed in 1018.  Recovery in the east  In the east, the Arabs once again became a threat to the Empire. However, Basil II's attacks won many more victories. Much of Syria was restored to the Empire and Turkey and Armenia were secured. After 1025, the Arabs were no longer a threat to the Byzantine Empire.  Decline of the Empire 1025\u20131453  1025\u20131071  After the Byzantine Emperor Basil II died, many unskilled Emperors came to the throne. They wasted the money of the Empire and reduced her army. This meant that she could not defend herself well against her enemies if they would attack. Later, the Byzantines relied on mercenaries, soldiers who fought for money and not for their country, so they were less loyal and reliable and more expensive.  Due to this system that depended on mercenaries, military generals were able to rise to power and usurp it from the elaborate bureaucracy, a system of administration where tasks are divided by departments.  Invasion of the Turks 1071\u20131091  A large number of people known as the Turks rode on horseback from central Asia and attacked the Byzantine Empire. They took all of Turkey from the Byzantines by 1091. However, the Byzantines received help from people in Europe. This help is known as the First Crusade . Many knights and soldiers left to help the Byzantines but also to secure Jerusalem for Christians, which at the time was in Muslim hands.

At the time it was made, at the birth of the sound era in 1929, it was seen as a vehicle for Emil Jannings , the German actor who had just won the first Academy Award for best actor (for both \"The Last Command\" and \"The Way of All Flesh\") after starring in such silent landmarks as \" The Last Laugh \" and \" Faust .\" Dietrich's overnight stardom inspired distributors to recut the film, ending it with one of her songs instead of his pathetic closing moments, and this restored version shows the entire film for the first time in years.  Advertisement  Even then there is a choice to be made. Jannings and his director, Josef von Sternberg, had established themselves in the silent era, when films knew no language barriers, and they shot the film in both English and German. This is the English version, with Dietrich and Jannings fluent (the Austrian Jannings claimed, falsely, that he had been born in Brooklyn), but many prefer the German version because the actors feel more at home with the dialogue.  Whatever its language, \"The Blue Angel\" looks and feels more like a silent film, with its broad performances that underline emotions. Von Sternberg, who was raised in Europe and America and began his career in Hollywood, was much influenced by German expressionism, as we see in early street scenes where the buildings tilt toward each other at crazy angles reminiscent of \" The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari .\" He was a bold visual artist who liked shots where the actors shared space with foreground props and dramatic shadows, and he makes the dressing room beneath the stage of the Blue Angel nightclub into a haunting psychic dungeon. Lotte Eisner observes in The Haunted Screen, her study of German expressionism, that von Sternberg was more at ease with sound than many of his contemporaries (this was his second talkie), and was perhaps the first director to deal with how offstage sounds alter as doors are opened and closed. Sound itself was seen as self-sufficient in the earlier days, but von Sternberg was already modulating it, tilting it toward realism.

His theory that photography can capture the meaning beneath outward appearance in instants of extraordinary clarity is perhaps best expressed in his book Images \u00e0 la sauvette (1952; The Decisive Moment).  Henri Cartier-Bresson.  Ernst Haas\u2014Hulton Archive/Getty Images  Cartier-Bresson was born and attended school in a village not far from Paris . In 1927\u201328 he studied in Paris with Andr\u00e9 Lhote , an artist and critic associated with the Cubist movement. Lhote implanted in him a lifelong interest in painting, a crucial factor in the education of his vision. In 1929 Cartier-Bresson went to the University of Cambridge , where he studied literature and painting.  As a boy, Cartier-Bresson had been initiated into the mysteries of the simple \u201cBrownie\u201d snapshot camera. But his first serious concern with the medium occurred about 1930, after seeing the work of two major 20th-century photographers, Eug\u00e8ne Atget and Man Ray . Making use of a small allowance, he traveled in Africa in 1931, where he lived in the bush, recording his experiences with a miniature camera. There he contracted blackwater fever , necessitating his return to France. The portability of a small camera and the ease with which one could record instantaneous impressions must have struck a sympathetic chord, for in 1933 he purchased his first 35-mm Leica. The use of this type of camera was particularly relevant to Cartier-Bresson. It lent itself not only to spontaneity but to anonymity as well. So much did Cartier-Bresson wish to remain a silent, and even unseen, witness, that he covered the bright chromium parts of his camera with black tape to render it less visible, and he sometimes hid the camera under a handkerchief. The man was similarly reticent about his life and work.  Children in Seville, Spain, photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson, 1933.

But there was nothing compulsive about his travels, and he explicitly expressed a desire to move slowly, to \u201clive on proper terms\u201d in each country, to take his time, so that he became totally immersed in the environment .  Henri Cartier-Bresson.  Jean Marquis/Magnum  In 1937 Cartier-Bresson produced a documentary film, his first, on medical aid in the Spanish Civil War . The date also marked his first reportage photographs made for newspapers and magazines. His enthusiasm for filmmaking was further gratified when, from 1936 to 1939, he worked as an assistant to the film director Jean Renoir in the production of Une Partie de campagne (A Day in the Country) and La R\u00e8gle du jeu (The Rules of the Game). As a photographer he felt indebted to the great films he saw as a youth. They taught him, he said, to choose precisely the expressive moment, the telling viewpoint. The importance he gave to sequential images in still photography may be attributed to his preoccupation with film.

He escaped in 1943 and the following year participated in a French underground photographic unit assigned to record the German occupation and retreat. In 1945 he made a film for the U.S. Office of War Information, Le Retour, which dealt with the return to France of released prisoners of war and deportees.

The huge motte is crowned with a 12th century shell keep, which guards the square towered inner bailey gatehouse and the Bevis Tower in the outer bailey. In the 17th century, during the Civil War, the castle was twice besieged and badly damaged, first by Royalists who took control, then by a Parliamentarian force led by William Waller.

This device works really well; whilst each animal varies in the role it played in Clare's life, it gives real meaning to the title.  Gill Heeley's beautiful drawings of every extra- special dog or horse enhance the chapter headings. I suspect many people will want her to draw precious equine or canine companions as a result.

Bangladesh will start as favourites, but only slightly given the nature of the format.  Ireland and Netherlands will be breathing down their neck with Oman happy to play the role of dark horses. Quite clearly the pressure is on Bangladesh to deliver, having reached the final of the Asia Cup only recently. For Ireland, this is a chance to emphasise once again that they are the premier team when it comes to the Associate nations.  There is a sense of uneasiness in the Netherlands camp with having to play an extra round that could potentially knock them out after having already played a qualifying round.  \"I think every team that is playing in the first round or qualifier or whatever it is called knows that it is going to be very tough,\" said Peter Borren, the Netherlands captain. \"We were fortunate enough to sneak in in 2014. But here first out of four teams is very difficult. You have to feel for for all the teams probably. I feel for those of us who have already gone through a qualifying round, which was pretty difficult. Good teams missed out there.  \"And also feel for the likes of Bangladesh. They are playing Test cricket. They have to come back here to play and qualify. I personally don't see why this tournament has to be. The main draw has to be ten teams but that's what it is. It's probably a conversation for another day. Tomorrow we are playing a big game. Whether or not it is fair or whether or not it is the right way for the tournament to be played is a concern. But its not the concern for me right now.\"  This stage of the tournament has been designed by the International Cricket Council to ensure that the top eight teams go through automatically to the main round with the other teams having to fight it out for the other two spots. As Borren says, it is what it is now.  Bangladesh:  Given their recent performances in T20Is, Bangladesh's cricket is definitely on an upswing. With that comes the pressure of expectations. They will be playing their first game against Netherlands barely two days after losing the Asia Cup final.  Neither have they had time to practice and acclimatise to the conditions, nor have they had the time to recover from a heart-wrenching loss. But now they get into another important game and it is imperative for Mashrafe Mortaza to try and get the best out of his men.  The captain acknowledged that it wouldn't be an easy task at all but also seemed upbeat about doing well after a string of good performances. Switching from underdogs to favourites in such quick time will not be an easy task but the squad contains a good mix of youngsters and experienced players suited to the format.  The conditions in Dharamsala might also favour their seamers, which boosts their chances further. A lot rides on the fitness of Mustafizur Rahman and it remains to be seen if he will be rushed back into the playing eleven after a side strain kept him out of the final stages of the Asia Cup.

Uranus  News  Uranus Facts  Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third largest (by diameter).        Uranus is larger in diameter but smaller in mass than Neptune  Planet Profile  orbit : 2,870,990,000 km (19.218 AU ) from Su  diameter : 51,118 km (equatorial)  Careful pronunciation may be necessary        to avoid embarrassment; say \"YOOR\u00a0a\u00a0nus\"\u00a0  , not  \"your anus\" or \"urine us\".  Uranus is the ancient Greek deity of the Heavens, the earliest supreme god. Uranus was the son and mate of Gaia the father of Cronus (Saturn) and of the Cyclopes and Titans (predecessors of the Olympian gods).  Uranus, the first planet discovered in modern times, was discovered by William Herschel while systematically searching        the sky with his telescope on March 13, 1781.        It had actually been seen many times before but ignored as simply another star        (the earliest recorded sighting was in 1690 when John Flamsteed       cataloged it as 34 Tauri).        Herschel named it \"the\u00a0Georgium\u00a0Sidus\"        (the Georgian Planet) in honor of his patron,        the infamous (to Americans) King George III of England; others called it        \"Herschel\".  The name \"Uranus\" was        first proposed by Bode in conformity with the        other planetary names from classical mythology but didn't come into        common use until 1850.  Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 on Jan 24 1986.  Most of the planets spin on an axis nearly perpendicular to the plane of        the ecliptic but Uranus' axis is almost        parallel to the ecliptic.        At the time of Voyager 2's passage,        Uranus' south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun.        This results in the odd fact that Uranus' polar regions receive more energy        input from the Sun than do its equatorial regions.        Uranus is nevertheless hotter at its equator than at its poles. The mechanism        underlying this is unknown.  Actually, there's an ongoing battle over which of Uranus'        poles is its north pole!  Either its axial inclination is a bit over 90        degrees and its rotation is direct ,        or it's a bit less than 90 degrees and the rotation is retrograde .        The problem is that you need to draw a dividing line *somewhere*, because        in a case like Venus there is little dispute        that the rotation is indeed        retrograde (not a direct rotation with an inclination of nearly 180).  Uranus is composed primarily of rock and various ices ,        with only about 15% hydrogen and a little helium (in contrast to Jupiter and Saturn which are mostly hydrogen).        Uranus (and Neptune) are in many ways similar to the cores of Jupiter and        Saturn minus the massive liquid metallic hydrogen envelope.        It appears that Uranus does not have a rocky core like Jupiter and Saturn        but rather that its material is more or less uniformly distributed.  Uranus' atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane.  Like the other gas planets, Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around  rapidly.  But they are extremely faint, visible only with radical image        enhancement of the Voyager 2 pictures        (right).        Recent observations with HST (left) show larger and        more pronounced streaks.        Further HST observations show even more activity.   Uranus is no longer the bland boring planet that Voyager saw! It now seems clear that the differences are due to        seasonal effects since the Sun is now at a  lower Uranian latitude which may        cause more pronounced day/night weather effects.   By 2007 the Sun will be directly over Uranus's equator.  Uranus' blue color is the result of absorption of red light by methane in the        upper atmosphere.

I turned around in 2010 at the Second Step because of bad weather and fatigue.\u00a0 In 2011, I turned around at the First Step because of a miscalculation of oxygen requirements by my Sherpa. In\u00a0 2012 , I turned around at the Second Step because of bad weather. I summitted Mt. Everest from the North side on May 25, 2014, becoming the oldest person living outside of Asia to reach the Top of the World. Photos and video of all of these climbs can be found in the Gallery.  The main climbing routes on the South and North sides of Mt. Everest are quite different. In a South side climb, the trip begins with a 35-mile trek to Base Camp from the tiny village of Lukla nestled in the mountains. Lukla is accessed by a short, but extremely dangerous, flight on a twin engine airplane that departs from the airport in Kathmandu. It has been said that the airport in Lukla is the most dangerous in the world. The views of Mt. Everest are obstructed by surrounding mountains for most of the trekking and climbing route. A South side climb begins with an ascent from Base Camp, located at 17,600 feet, up the treacherous Khumbu Icefall. There are 4 camps on the mountain, with high camp located on the South Col at 26,000 feet. In a South side climb, the route to the summit is more direct and steep than the route to the summit on the North side. This makes the climbing somewhat more difficult, but it also means that a climber in trouble can get down to safety much quicker on the South side. Also, helicopter evacuations are possible from Base Camp and Camp 1 above the Khumbu Icefall, which is not the case on the North side.  In a North side climb, Base Camp in Tibet, often referred to as \u201cChinese Base Camp,\u201d is accessed by land rover from Kathmandu or by a flight to the capital city of Lhasa. In either case, vehicles can drive directly into Base Camp. The views of Mt. Everest are unobstructed and magnificent for the entire expedition. From Chinese Base Camp at 17,056 feet, climbers ascend to Advance Base Camp at 21,000 feet. There is no icefall on the North side. Most of the time is spent at ABC. So, North side climbers need to deal with the rigors of high altitude much longer on the North side than on the South side. There is also no helicopter evacuation anywhere on the mountain on the North side. If a climber gets into trouble, he/she needs to get down to Chinese Base Camp for evacuation by vehicle to the nearest hospital. Also, the weather tends to be worse on the North side, most especially the winds, which can reach hurricane force. I experienced the full force of this weather during my descent from the summit in 2014. There are 3 camps on the North side, with high camp located at 27, 224. As noted above, climbers spend more time at high altitude on the North side, which takes a terrible toll on the body and makes a rapid descent more problematic.  Which side is more difficult?

He was later replaced by Freeway, Jr.  Theme from the television series Hart To Hart  For more information on FREEWAY, click here  Hart to Hart - TV.comHart to Hart - Show News, Reviews, Recaps and Photos - TV.com  EDIT  Created by author Sidney Sheldon, the series started out under title Double Twist. Tom Mankiewicz was asked to revamp the script and it was soon renamed Hart to Hart. With Robert Wagner as self-made millionaire Jonathan Hart, Stefanie Powers as his journalist wife Jennifer and Lionel Stander as their trusty sidekick Max the \"Hartbeat\" began. Premiering on August 25, 1979, Hart was met with mixed reviews but by the end of the first season Jonathan and Jennifer Hart were household names. Guest appearances were made by everyone from Stella Stevens and Roddy McDowell to Jill St. John and Dorothy Lamour and even a cameo by Natalie Wood. The series would run for five seasons before leaving ABC in 1984. Hart to Hart is still airing in syndication in over 60 countries worldwide. In 1993 while touring together in A.R. Gurney's Love Letters, RJ, Stefanie and Lionel would return to television\u00a0in the first of what would be eight 2-hour Hart movies. Jokingly dubbed \"Hart to Hart: The New Generation\", Jonathan and Jennifer still found themselves going from one adventure to the next. The first five would air as NBC Friday Night Mysteries. Sadly, Lionel Stander died shortly after completing the fifth movie and the sixth movie saw the Harts atending Max's funeral. The final three movies aired on The Family Channel. Interesting tidbit. The last movie aired on Aug 25 1996.

{"input": "Question: Which firework is said to be named after an instrument of torture on which a saint is said to have been martyred? </s> Context: Instrument of torture | Epic Fireworks BlogInstrument of torture | Epic Fireworks Blog  Instrument of torture  paul singh 2 Comments  The Catherine wheel is a type of firework which is generally made of a spiralling tube filled with pyrotechnic composition, or an angled rocket mounted with a pin through its centre. When ignited, it rotates quickly, producing a display of sparks and coloured flame and looks great at the bottom of the garden.  So, now we know what a Catherine Wheel is, where did it get its unusual name from?  It\u2019s a lot more gruesome than you may think, the family favourite firework is named after the instrument of torture, the breaking wheel, on which, legend has it St. Catherine was martyred. Although some legends say that as soon as she touched the wheel it broke (that must have put the willies up the pagans \u2013 not a euphemism)  The Catherine Wheel was a product of the Middle Ages, especially popular in Germany (no comments on this please, remember we\u2019re all friends now, one Europe and all that). The victim\u2019s limbs were brutally smashed with large blunt objects. His (or her) still-living remains were subjected to\u2026 the wheel. This meant the mangled arms and legs were threaded through the spokes. The wheel was then hoisted into the air using a long pole. Hungry vultures and crows picked at the body. Death came slowly, (like watching an Al Murray \u2013 Pub Landlord comedy routine).  A seventeenth-century chronicler wrote the victim looked like, \u201cA sort of huge screaming puppet writhing in rivulets of blood, a puppet with four tentacles, like a sea monster, of raw, slimy and shapeless flesh mixed up with splinters of smashed bones.\u201d Sleep soundly kids.  This was one of the most popular spectacles of the time. This, and similar methods of torture, took place in the squares of Europe from 1450-1750. The masses, both common people and nobles, watched in twisted fascination, cheering at a good wheeling (what made it good is unclear but we guess the messier the better). A woman (or a number of women in a row) brought even greater enthusiasm, similar to women in pro-wrestling nowadays, although for quite different reasons we assume.  The wheel was named after Saint Catherine of Alexandria from the early 4th century. She was believed to have been killed in this fashion during the rule of the Roman Emperor Maximinus (presumably Maximinus was upset about people commenting that his name was somewhat similar to that of a sanitary towel \u2013 citation needed).  Catherine was born and raised a pagan, but miraculously converted to Christianity in her late teens (typical rebellious teenager). It is said that she visited her contemporary, the Roman Emperor Maximinus, and attempted to convince him of the error of his ways in persecuting Christians. She succeeded in converting his wife, the Empress, and many pagan philosophers whom the Emperor sent to dispute with her, all of whom were subsequently martyred. Upon the failure of the Emperor to win Catherine over, he ordered her to be put in prison; and when the people who visited her converted this must have really annoyed big Maximinus because she was condemned to death on the breaking wheel (the name at that time for the Catherine Wheel). According to legend, the wheel itself broke when she touched it, so she was beheaded.  You can just imagine the scene\u2026  Sound effects: Splintering wood and crashing  Catherine: \u201cWhoops, clumsy me, sorry bout that lads.\u201d  First torturer: \u201coh, look, oh no, she has the power of God, her hand has broken the wheel, cower in fear, cower and plead for your life!\u201d  Second torturer: \u201cNo probs, I\u2019ll just lob \u2018er \u2018ead off.\u201d  Sound effects: Swish, Splat, Thud, General Medieval style cheering.

{"input": "Question: The South African currency unit, the Rand, is divided into a hundred what? </s> Context: rand | South African currency | Britannica.comrand | South African currency | Britannica.com  South African currency  coinage  Rand, monetary unit of South Africa . Each rand is divided into 100 cents. The South African Reserve Bank has the exclusive authority to issue coins and banknotes in the country. Coins range in denomination from 5 cents to 50 rand. Banknotes are denominated in values from 10 to 200 rand. During the apartheid era, when the country\u2019s white-minority regime ruled through restrictive legislation, banknotes contained historical figures associated with that regime. Since the peaceful transition to full democratic rule in the early 1990s, banknotes have been adorned with colourful images of wildlife; they include the rhinoceros (10-rand note), elephant (20-rand note), lion (50-rand note), buffalo (100-rand note), and leopard (200-rand note). In 2012 a portrait of Nelson Mandela was added to banknotes, with animals appearing on the reverse side. The country\u2019s coins, which contain images of plant and animal life, feature the use of South Africa\u2019s various languages to render the country\u2019s name. South Africa used the British pound sterling until 1921, when the South African pound was introduced. South Africa adopted the rand in 1961; it replaced the pound at a rate of 2 rand for 1 pound.

Courtesy of Ron Wise  SOUTH AFRICAN RAND - crnindiaSouth African Rand  SOUTH AFRICAN RAND  Introduction | Overview | Structure | History | Factors               affecting change in exchange rates | Weekly               trend of South African rand  Introduction  Rand is the official unit of currency used as a legal tender in               Republic of South Africa. The ISO 4217 currency code for the South               African rand is ZAR and numeric code is 710. ZAR is an acronym for               Zuid afrikaanse Rand, \"Zuid Afrika\" being a term used               for the country\ufffds name in the Dutch language. It was introduced               as the national currency of South Africa with the independence of               the country in 1961 and hence it replaced the South African pound.               The rand is divided into 100 equal parts of its subunit, which is               none other than \"cent\".  The South African currency gets its name from \"Witswatersrand\" i.e. the name of the white water ridge onto which the city of               Johannesburg is constructed and most of the South African gold               deposits are located, rand meaning a ridge. In daily use, South               African rand is denoted with the symbol \"R\".  Overview  South Africa is one the fastest developing countries of the world               courtesy the possession of large pool of abundant natural               resources, but the growth of the nation still had been on a weaker               side. The problems of high poverty and unemployment still prevail               dominantly over the economy of South Africa. The same trend had               been observed in the case of value of its currency. During the               initial 20 years of existence, the South African rand was valued               even higher than US dollar; the fall in the value of the currency               in the recent years hasn\ufffdt been recovered yet. Though some               industries have benefited from this fall in the value of rand like               the tourism industry and even the more important gold mining               industry.  In the current scenario, the rand has caught               attention of the speculators and investors because it is               considered to be under rated by 15 to 20% and the values are               subject to fluctuations. There also exist some government currency               policies to control the import-export of the currency. One is that               the import and export of more than R5000 is restricted except if               it is exchanged with the countries Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia.               Any foreign currency imported and exported from South Africa must               be declared.  Structure  South African rand being a newly adopted                                 currency uses the decimal system like all other                                 modern currencies. The issuance and distribution                                 of rand in bank notes as well as coinage are in                                 the hands of South African Reserve Bank", "truth": ["cents"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6417", "mistake": "100 equal parts of its subunit", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: On a clothing label a cross through what shape means 'Do Not Dry Clean'? </s> Context: What Do the Washing Symbols on Clothing Labels Mean?Wash Symbols | Care Labels, Ironing & Dry Cleaning | Cleanipedia  Five Dots = 70oC  Six Dots = 95oC  The Permanent Press symbol has one line beneath the standard wash symbol. Permanent Press fabrics have been treated with chemicals to ensure they resist wrinkles and retain their original shape. If a piece of clothing is permanent press, it usually means that you shouldn\u2019t iron it.  The Gentle Cycle symbol has two lines beneath the standard wash symbol. The gentle cycle is for delicate fibres like wool or silk, or for items of clothing that could be damaged by a vigorous washing (like sequined tops, tights, or lycra).  The Hand Wash symbol is the standard wash symbol with a hand at the top. For \u2018Hand Wash\u2019 clothing, do not use a washing machine. Instead wash garments in a sink or small tub, using your hands to ensure that the cleaning liquid is thoroughly rubbed into the material and subsequently rinsed out. Check your cleaning liquid to make sure it is suitable for hand-washing \u2013 milder detergents have been specifically designed for hand wash use, and they are safe for your clothes and for your hands!  The Do Not Wash symbol is the standard wash symbol with a cross through it. If the label instructs you not to wash the item, it will have to be dry cleaned after it gets dirty \u2013 see the section on Dry Cleaning Symbols below.  Bleaching Guidelines on Clothing Labels  The next symbol on the clothes label is a triangle that refers to whether specific bleaching conditions are required for the item.  A triangle without anything in the middle means that any kind of bleach can be used on the clothing when needed.  A triangle filled with diagonal lines means that only non-chlorine bleaches should be used. Check the ingredients on your bleach to see if it contains chlorine.  A solid black triangle with crossed lines means \u2018do not bleach\u2019 \u2013 you should not attempt to use any kind of bleach on this garment.  Drying Guidelines on Clothing Labels  The basic tumble dryer symbol is a square with a circle in the middle of it.  As with the symbols for washing clothes, the number of dots inside the circle will tell you the heat setting you should put your tumble dryer on to, as well as any specific program settings required. Three dots mean Tumble Dry High.  Two dots means Tumble Dry Medium.  One dot means Tumble Dry Low.  When an item is marked as \u2018do not tumble dry\u2019 with a cross through the drying symbol, leave this garment to drip-dry on a drying rack, in an airing cupboard, or outside on your washing line rather than putting it in the dryer.  Again, a single line below the dryer symbol means that a Permanent Press setting should be used.  Double lines indicate that the Delicate setting must be used.  Ironing Guidelines on Garment Labels  To make life easy, the ironing symbol is shaped like an old-fashioned iron.  \u00a0Ironing symbols also employ the same dot system for heat levels, which should be adjustable on your iron: three dots mean that the item can be ironed on high.  Two dots mean that it can be ironed on medium.  One dot means that it can be ironed on low.  \u00a0  Dry Cleaning Guidelines on Garment Labels  The dry cleaning symbol is a circle.  \u00a0For clothes that are dry clean only, the circle has a letter \u2018P\u2019 inside it.  The clothes that should be dry-cleaned under normal conditions will have a letter \u2018F\u2019 inside the circle.

{"input": "Question: In November 1935, which British prime minister returned to office after a general election? </s> Context: British Prime Ministers - 1922-1945 - GlobalSecurity.orgBritish Prime Ministers - 1922-1945  British Prime Ministers - 1922-1945  Conservative  Andrew Bonar Law, Conservative Prime Minister from 1922-3, offered the government the support of the Conservatives in the coalition government at the outbreak of the Great War. Their coalition was re-elected by a landslide following the Armistice.  Law persuaded the Conservatives to end the coalition, and work as an independent party. Conservative withdrawal forced Lloyd George to resign. The King then invited Law to form a new administration in 1922. Law's 'Tranquility Manifesto' was an attempt to allow Britain to recover from war damage. Though elected, he lasted just 209 days in office. He resigned in May 1923 due to ill health.  Stanley Baldwin, Conservative Prime Minister from 1923, 1924-9, 1935-7, played a leading part in a Conservative rebellion which overthrew the coalition government and the premiership of Lloyd George. In Bonar Law's Conservative government he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. When Bonar Law retired through illness in May 1923, Baldwin became prime minister. Determined to help reduce unemployment, in November he called a general election to seek support for a policy of trade protection. Failing to retain a majority, his government resigned in January 1924. Its replacement, the first Labour government also lacked an overall majority, and after it was defeated in another general election in October 1924, Baldwin returned as prime minister.  James Ramsay MacDonald, Labour Prime Minister from 1924 and 1929-35, became chairman of the parliamentary Labour group in 1911. As the Labour Party grew, however, he was criticised as being too moderate. His opposition to the Great War made him more unpopular still. In 1924 was asked by George V to form a government when Stanley Baldwin's small Conservative majority proved ungovernable. In his second minority government in 1929, the economic crises, including the doubling of unemployment levels, persuaded him to include the opposition leaders in a cross-party National Government.  During the 1931 financial and political crisis, Baldwin contributed to the formation of a 'National' coalition government, led by the former Labour prime minister, MacDonald. As Lord President of the Council, Baldwin at first sought to promote international disarmament, warning of the difficulty of defence against air attack: 'the bomber will always get through'. But as the threat from Nazi Germany became obvious, he accepted the need for rearmament and introduced new defence programmes each year from 1934 to 1937, against Labour and Liberal opposition.  Baldwin became prime minister of the National government in June 1935. In the autumn he won a general election, promising to continue to strengthen national defences. When seeking to avoid war with Mussolini's Italy over Abyssinia in order to focus effort against Hitler's Germany, his Cabinet was embarrassed by premature disclosure of a compromise settlement ('the Hore-Laval pact'). In retrospect the National Government's policy of combining armed deterrence with efforts to bind Hitler and Mussolini into a general European settlement seemed insufficient, and after the Second World War broke out in 1939 Baldwin became a leading target for those - especially Churchill - who thought more could have been done to accelerate rearmament and prevent war.  Neville Chamberlain, Conservative Prime Minister from 1937-40,  succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister in May 1937. War was brewing in Europe, and had already exploded in Spain. Chamberlain was unwilling to go down in history as responsible for an inevitably destructive war without doing everything possible to prevent it. Neville Chamberlain, as with many in Europe who had witnessed the horrors of the First World War and its aftermath, was committed to peace at almost any price. Chamberlain famously met German chancellor Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938 the result of which was an agreement that Britain and Germany would never again go to war. \"I believe,\" he declared on his return to the UK, \"it is peace for our time.\" However, the success of 'appeasement' was shortlived, as Hitler occupied Prague the following year.

Subscribe to Taste of Country on  Dolly Parton is as sweet as homemade apple pie, but she wound up mired in controversy over one of her film roles.  Parton launched her acting career in the 1980 mega-hit 9 to 5, in which she starred with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. She was poised for a very big screen career when she accepted a starring role in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, a 1982 film adaptation of the 1978 Broadway play of the same name.  Parton played Mona Stangley, who runs a brothel called the Chicken Ranch in a small Texas town and has had a long-term affair with the local sheriff, Ed Earl Dodd, played by Burt Reynolds. Dom DeLuise played Melvin P. Thorpe, a national TV personality who runs a segment on the small town and exposes the fact that a brothel operates there, which causes all manner of trouble for the main characters.  The musical comedy featured much of the same music from the Broadway production, but Parton contributed \u201cSneakin\u2019 Around,\u201d which she performed as a duet with Reynolds, and a shortened version of her signature hit, \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d also appears in the film. Released as a single from the film\u2019s soundtrack, the song reached No. 1 for the second time.  The movie\u2019s title proved controversial upon its release. \u201cWhorehouse\u201d was considered obscene in some parts of the country, where the title was either altered to The Best Little Cathouse in Texas for print ads or bleeped for TV ads. Parton herself even referred to the film as The Best Little Chicken House in Texas in some of her interviews to promote the project, but those difficulties didn\u2019t affect the film\u2019s reception. It opened at No. 1 at the box office and went on to earn nearly $70 million during its initial theatrical run, while Parton earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical).

Posted on Mar.12, 2009. Filed in 1 Samuel . Average rating: 4.4 / 10 ( Rate It ).  We are all familiar with the biblical account of David killing Goliath: David, the plucky underdog, went up against the enemy that no one else dared to face, Goliath, and prevailed. The Bible, however, is inconsistent concerning what weapon\u00a0David used to kill Goliath.  In the version of the story with which we are most familiar, David kills Goliath with a sling:  So David prevailed over the Philistine [Goliath] with a sling and a stone, striking down the Philistine and killing him; there was no sword in David\u2019s hand. [1 Samuel 17:50 (NRSV)]  This account not only gives us the weapon that David did use, \u201ca sling and a stone\u201d, but also gives us a weapon that David didn\u2019t use,\u00a0explicitly stating that David wasn\u2019t carrying a sword when he killed Goliath.  The very next verse, however, tells us that David killed Goliath with a sword:  Then David ran and stood over the Philistine; he grasped his sword, drew it out of its sheath, and killed him; then he cut off his head with it. [1 Samuel 17:51 (NRSV)]  David can\u2019t have killed Goliath twice, so which of these accounts is correct? Did David kill Goliath with a sling or a sword?  N.B. All posts are written in a style sympathetic to the claim of Biblical error, even in cases where the author (\"Errancy\") disagrees with the claim. See the About page for the site's philosophy.  Apologetics Press - How Did Goliath Die?Apologetics Press - How Did Goliath Die?  How Did Goliath Die?  Eric Lyons, M.Min.  Even individuals with only a nodding acquaintance of the Bible are aware of how Goliath died: \u201cDavid killed the giant with a sling and a stone, of course.\u201d Indeed, that is what 1 Samuel 17:48-50 indicates:  David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him.  Skeptics, however, are quick to point out that the above verses contradict what is stated in the very next verse: \u201cTherefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it\u201d (17:51). How could David have killed Goliath with a rock and then have killed him with a sword? According to atheist Rayan Zehn, the question of how David killed Goliath is a \u201cfavorite,\u201d because \u201cit contradicts itself in a single breath\u201d\u2014in back-to-back verses (\u201cBible Contradictions\u201d). \u201cSo Bible believer tell me, exactly how did Goliath die?\u201d  We first need to make the observation that few, if any, sane individuals are going to contradict themselves in the very next sentence of what they are speaking or writing. Even liars rarely contradict themselves in the very next breath. Are we really to believe that the ancient individual who was intelligent enough to pen the book of Samuel was so ignorant that he actually thought at one moment David literally killed Goliath with a rock and the very next moment that David killed the giant with a sword? Such an allegation seems suspect at best.  Second, we need to keep in mind that there are many specific questions that Bible students cannot answer about things mentioned in Scripture. For example, God created light without the Sun on day one of Creation, but we are uninformed about the nature", "truth": ["david"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7386", "mistake": "a sling or a sword", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

Unless you firmly believe in the theory \"What you don't                      know doesn't hurt you,\" you can stop reading now.  The housefly is a nuisance and its body is festered with                      bacteria that can be transmitted to our food. It seems they                      always know when we are eating, as they suddenly appear from                      nowhere, trying to taste whatever we are having. What's worst,                      these annoying pest have the audacity to lay their eggs on                      our food. That sweet piece of meat you were saving for last is a prime target for flies. All you have to do is leave your                      food unattended and uncovered for a short while and a fly                      is ready to add a few extra ingredients to your meal. The                      fly, a master at hiding its eggs, prefers to deposit them                      in the crevices of meat or whatever food it chooses to lay                      them on. You need a keen eye to find an egg deposit.  Life Cycle  A female housefly can lay a batch of 75 to 150 eggs at a time.                      A single female can lay several batches totalling up to 500                      eggs in about 3 to 4 days. Eggs are laid on any suitable food                      source such as decomposing food in garbage, animal excrement,                      carrion and other decomposing organic matter. Shown below                      is an egg deposit on a chunk of corn beef. Food is never pretty                      close up. The eggs are very tiny so the photo includes a pencil                      to give an idea of the eggs' relative size.  Eggs                      hatch into larvae or maggots within one day. Full-grown maggots                      are ready to pupate in a few days. Before transforming to                      the pupa stage, the maggots crawl from their food source to                      find a cool place to dry. This is the stage were we often                      see them crawling out of our garbage. In optimal conditions,                      adult flies emerge from the pupae completing the process of                      egg to adult in about 7 to 10 days.

They called the Island Wiht (weight) meaning raised or what rises over the sea. Then the Romans arrived in 43 AD and translated Wiht into the name Vectis from the Latin veho meaning lifting.  The Roman rule started under Vespasian and continued peacefully for over four hundred years. Then followed a period of strife starting with the Saxons under Cerdic and Cynric in 530 AD. Many of the natives were slaughtered and four years after Cerdic's death the government was divided between his two nephews Stuf and Wihtgar. In 544 Wihtgar died and was buried at Carisbrooke. In 661 AD, Wight changed hands again when it was taken  by Wulfhure, King of the Mercians, but it was in 686 AD that the West Saxon King, Caedwalla, conquered it and brought Christianity to the Island.  For two centuries the people of Wight then led a fairly peaceful life until the Danes arrived this far south. In 897 AD their visits for 'burning and killing' went on for over 100 years so the Islanders lived in constant fear.  The Middle Ages  At the time of the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror granted overlordship of the Isle of Wight to his relative William FitzOsbern who began the construction of a castle at Carisbrooke. The lordship of the Island passed to the De Redvers family in 1101, with the hereditary rights and privileges that accompanied it, until the Countess Isabella De Fortibus, the last survivor in the family, sold the Island to Edward 1 in 1293 for six thousand marks.  The acquisition of full control of the Island by the crown was important because the Island's vulnerability to invasion. The lordship of the Island was now a royal appointment. One of the lords of the Island - Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick - was actually given a title of King to the Isle of Wight in 1444 by Henry V1, who attended the ceremony and placed the crown on his head.  During the Hundred Years' War, the Island, like much of the south coast, became a target for marauding French. The Island's only fortification, the Norman Castle at Carisbrooke, assumed a defence role for which it was unsuited owing to its central position; The French could land on the coast and burn and plunder while ignoring the castle. Towns and villages like Yarmouth, Newtown and Newport were sometimes attacked and burned. It is said that in 1377 a party  of French fell into an ambush on the outskirts of Newport and were cut to pieces in Dead Man's Lane, now Trafalgar Road. They are supposed to be buried at 'Noddies Hill', now known as Nodehill or Upper St. James' Street. On the same occasion the French besieged the castle, but, according to the legend, retired on the death of their commander, shot from the castle's west wall. Concern about the French attacks is shown in the frequent modifications made to the Castle's defences in the 14th Century.  Tudor & Stuart Period  The strategic importance of the Island increased with the development of Portsmouth as a permanent naval base. Henry VIII accordingly built additional fortifications on the island at Yarmouth, East & West Cowes and Sandown, sometimes re-using stone from dissolved monasteries as building material. Sir Richard Worsley, Captain of the Island at this time, successfully commanded the resistance to the last of the French attacks in 1545, at the time of the loss of the Mary Rose.  During the reign of Elizabeth 1, the Island was again threatened by invasion, this time from Spain. Sir George Carey, cousin of the Queen and Captain of the Island, took up residence at Carisbrooke Castle in 1583 and undertook repairs to the defences. Although the Armada was defeated in 1588, the Spanish threat remained, and the outer fortifications of Carisbrooke Castle were built between 1597 and 1602 in response to the invasion scare.

A:  Quick Answer  Containing everything from the ocean basins to continents, the crust is the outermost layer of the Earth. Overall, the crust makes up very little of the Earth's mass, so the other layers, which are the mantle, outer core and inner core, are much thicker.  Full Answer  Metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rocks appear on the Earth's crust. At most, the crust's thickness is about 45 miles, and beneath that is a section of semi-solid rock, known as the mantle. Beneath the mantle is the Earth's outer core, which is a liquid layer of iron, and the inner core, which is a solid layer of iron and nickel under extreme pressure.  The Layers of the Earth - Planet EarthThe Layers of the Earth - Planet Earth  Planet Earth  HELP!  Layers of the Earth  Uh oh! I don't know anything about the \"Layers of the Earth\" and nothing about how many layers there are but luckily my website has as section of Earth Layers. Here are the most main information you should know about the \"layers\", there are 4 layers in the earth, the crust, the massive mantle, outer core and the solid inner core. The Crust is the thinnest layer in the earth. The Mantle is very massive (huge) if you don't get huge imagine it takes up 80% of the earth now that is huge. The outer core is made of iron and nickel. The inner core is the most inner layer it is very solid. I bet you need more information if you do just scroll down and you'll find non-confusing information.  Crust  The crust is the most outer layer of the Earth. The crust is very rigid (Hard). The crust is made of granite and basalt. The ocean basically takes up 70% of the crust. The thin rocky crust is made out of silicon, aluminum, calcium, sodium and\u00a0 potassium . The crust is divided into continental plates that drift slowly every year (about a few centimeters). Just a few kilometers below your feet, its molten rock, extending to for thousands of kilometers down to the planet's super heated iron core. The entire earth's crust occupies just 1% of the earth's volume. The Earth's crust thickness is 30 km thick. The temperature of the crust is 2oo degrees\u00a0Celsius\u00a0(392\u00a0Fahrenheit) to 400 degrees\u00a0Celsius\u00a0(752\u00a0Fahrenheit).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Mantle  The Mantle is the second layer of the earth, it takes up 80% of the Earth. The mantle has two sections (Lithosphere and the  Asthenosphere). The temperature of the\u00a0 lithosphere \u00a0and\u00a0 asthenosphere \u00a0is 300 to 500 degrees celsius. The mantles temperature 4500 degrees celsius and made of 100% magma. In the mantle, convection currents occur. The\u00a0 convection currents\u00a0 occurs in the lithosphere and the asthenosphere. The mantle is very deep it is 1800- 2900 kilometers deep. A very\u00a0interesting fact is that the mantle grows about a meter every year.\u00a0  Lithosphere  The lithosphere is the upper part of the mantle. The Lithospheres temperature is about 400 degrees celsius. The lithosphere (lower mantle) is rigid part of the mantle. The lithosphere is not only part of the mantle it is the crust and the upper part of the mantle together. The depth of the lithosphere is 50-100 km thick.  Asthenosphere  The asthenosphere is the lower part of the mantle. The asthenosphere temperature is 300-500 degrees\u00a0Celsius. The\u00a0asthenosphere\u00a0is ductile and can be pushed and deformed like silly putty in response to the warmth of the Earth. These rocks actually flow, moving in response to the stresses placed upon them by the motions of the deep interior of the Earth. The flowing asthenosphere carries the lithosphere of the Earth, including the continents, on its back.", "truth": ["crust", "cru\u017ft"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3852", "mistake": "The Crust", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Question: \"What was the name of the Jester in Shakespeare's \"\"As You Like It\"\"?\" ? </s> Context: The Jester's Mask - Literature - thenoodlebowl.comThe Jester's Mask - Literature  Books have been written on this topic! However, the most interesting facet of Shakespeare's jesters, in my opinion, is their ability to manipulate language; the Shakespearean fool speaks in nonsenses, misunderstandings and puns, yet often tells the truth where those who mean to be truthful cannot. The distorted world of the jester turns out to be reality; it is everyone else who lives in a distortion. Notable examples:  The Fool in King Lear. This character, with no name other than Fool, is probably Shakespeare's most famous jester; he accompanies his King as his only courtier, when Lear is driven out of court by his faithless daughters. As the King descends into madness, so he and his fool change places; it is Lear who has been a fool, while his jester has told him nothing but sense.  'Have more than thou showest,  Speak less than thou knowest,  Lend less than thou owest,  Ride more than thou goest,  Learn more than thou trowest,  Set less than thou throwest.  -The Fool, King Lear.  Touchstone in As You Like It. Touchstone performs the classic jester role. Interestingly, a touchstone was a stone used to test the purity of gold and silver. In the same way, Touchstone the jester tests the wits of his aristocratic masters.  The fool doth think himself wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.  -Touchstone, As You Like It.  Feste in Twelfth Night. Olivia's fool Feste is the only sane person in a kingdom ruled by chaos. He is the prime mover in the plot to fool Malvolio, and finally concludes the play. While playing the part of the classic jester, he also reveals a darker side in his manipulations of Malvolio.  And, of course, not to forget Puck, Bottom, Lavatch, Dogberry, Costard, Launcelot Gobbo, Pompey, Falstaff, Philip the Bastard, Hamlet, Montjoy, Trinculo, Yorick, and many others who perform the function of jester in some respects in various of Shakespeare's plays...  Jesters in Indian literature  The court jester has been a staple of Indian literature for centuries - see the Jesters in Reality: Asia page for accounts of some real Indian jesters. The jester character in Indian drama tends to be less physically impressive and rather older than the European jester stereotype, being rather a wise, sarcastic and witty adviser to the king. In Sanskrit drama the jester character, or vidusaka, often spoke his lines in an eastern province dialect, to set him apart from the other characters. Notable examples:  Madhavya in Kalidasa's Shakuntala. The king's jester is his loyal friend and adviser throughout this play, in which the king pursues the beautiful maiden Shakuntala, having espied her while out hunting. You can read a translation of Shakuntala here .  Jesters in Opera  Jesters show up in quite a few operas; they not only cut a fine figure onstage, but the grand scale and often melodramatic and elaborate settings of opera are ideal for the larger-than-life character of the jester. In addition, jesters are, of course, some of the most tragic figures anyone could possibly wish for... Notable examples:  Rigoletto, main character of the opera of the same name, is a tragic figure; the bitter, twisted hunchback who caters to the decadent and sadistic whims of his master the Duke. His machinations finally bring about his downfall, as his own innocent daughter falls victim to the Duke's evil.

{"input": "Question: In what modern-day country was the Norse settlement of Vinland? </s> Context: Vinland - Identifying the Viking Homeland in AmericaVinland - Identifying the Viking Homeland in America  Reconstructed buildings at L'anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, Canada.\u00a0 Rosa Cabecinhas and Alcino Cunha  Updated January 19, 2016.  In the 1960s, archaeologists Helge and Anne Stine Ingstad used the medieval Vinland Sagas to search for evidence of Viking landings on the North American continent. They eventually discovered the archaeological site of l'Anse aux Meadows , a Norse settlement on the coast of Newfoundland. But there was a problem\u2014while the site was clearly constructed by Vikings , some aspects of the site vicinity didn't match what the sagas described.  In particular, the Norse sagas refer to the Norse settlement as \"Vinland\", which translates to \"Wineland\" in old Norse. Historically, there were no grapes anywhere near l'Anse aux Meadows. To resolve this issue, the Ingstads argued that the word actually meant \"Pastureland\"\u2014but that is something that very few Norse philologists accept.  continue reading below our video  10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know  Archaeologist Birgitta Linderoth Wallace, among others, also believes that the word does indeed refer to grapes, and argues that Vinland included a larger slice of what is today Canada than just Newfoundland: a slice that did contain abundant grapes.  Read more about the Vinland Sagas  Background to Vinland  Despite conflicting accounts in the Vinland sagas, it is widely accepted these days that a small band of Norse adventurers landed on the North American continent about 1000 AD. Archaeological evidence of that was discovered in the 1960s, in the Canadian province of Newfoundland, at the site of L'Anse aux Meadows (Jellyfish Cove). Tying the archaeological site to a specific place name in the sagas has been somewhat tricky.  Viking Places in North America  Three place names are given in the Vinland sagas for the North American continent:  Straumfj\u00f6r\u00f0r (or Straumsfj\u00f6r\u00f0r), \"Fjord of Currents\" in Old Norse, mentioned in Eirik the Red's Saga as a base camp from which expeditions left in the summers  H\u00f3p, \"Tidal Lagoon\" or \"Tidal Estuary Lagoon\", mentioned in Eirik the Red's Saga as a camp far south of Straumfj\u00f6r\u00f0r where grapes were collected and lumber harvested  Leifsbu\u00f0ir, \"Leif's Camp\", mentioned in the Greenlander's Saga), which has elements of both sites  Straumfj\u00f6r\u00f0r was clearly the name of the Viking base camp: and there's no arguing that the archaeological ruins of L'Anse aux Meadows represent a substantial occupation. It's possible, perhaps likely, that Leifsbu\u00f0ir also refers to L'Anse aux Meadows. Since L'Anse aux Meadows is the only Norse archaeological site discovered in Canada to date, it is a little difficult to be certain of its designation as Straumfj\u00f6r\u00f0r: but, the Norse were only on the continent for a decade, and it doesn't seem likely that there would be two such substantial camps.  But, H\u00f3p? There are no grapes at L'anse aux Meadows.  Read more about L'Anse aux Meadows  Search for Vinland  Since the original excavations conducted by the Ingstad, archaeologist and historian Birgitta Linderoth Wallace has been conducting investigations of the first European attempt at establishing a trading base in North America, part of the Parks Canada team. One aspect that she has been investigating has been the term \"Vinland\" which was used in the Norse chronicles to describe the general location of Leif Eriksson's landing.  According to the Vinland sagas, which should (like most historical accounts) be taken with a grain of salt, Norsemen and a few women ventured out from their established colonies on Greenland about 1000 AD. The Norse said that they had landed in three separate places: Helluland, Markland and Vinland. Helluland, think scholars, was probably Baffin Island; Markland (or Tree Land), probably the heavily wooded coast of Labrador; and Vinland was almost certainly Newfoundland and points south.  The problem with identifying Vinland as Newfoundland is the name: Vinland means Wineland in Old Norse, and there aren't any grapes growing today or at any time in Newfoundland. The Ingstads, using the reports of the Swedish philologist Sven S\u00f6derberg, believed that the word \"Vinland\" didn't", "truth": ["canada"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3927", "mistake": "Canada", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

When her father was cast as the confidence trickster protagonist of Paper Moon (1973), O'Neal was awarded the part of Addie Loggins, the con man's \"ward\" and partner in crime. For this remarkable debut, O'Neal won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress -- which enabled her to demand profit percentage points on her next film, The Bad News Bears (1976). O'Neal played the only female member of a misfit junior-league baseball team (she was doubled by two young baseball champs); her highlight scene in Bears was the one in which she all but promised her body to a preteen punk to get him to join the ball club. Mid-'70s audiences were oddly attuned to films in which children swore and swilled beer, so The Bad News Bears was O'Neal 's second box-office hit in a row. Nickelodeon (1976) followed, wherein O'Neal played a 12-year-old silent-film scenarist, a character based on Anita Loos . This film, in which she was reunited with her Paper Moon co-star/father Ryan O'Neal and director Peter Bogdanovich , may have represented the actress' best work, but few filmgoers saw it. By 1980, O'Neal was old enough to appear as a summer-camp girl determined to lose her virginity in Little Darlings , but her acting skills paled beside those of her co-star, Kristy McNichol . As O'Neal got older, the roles became less interesting and fewer in number. Though she didn't act much in the '90s, O'Neal managed to keep her name in the public eye through her marriage to tennis star John McEnroe . The couple had three children together, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In the early 2000s, O'Neal found moderate success on the small screen, appearing on such shows as Sex and the City , Rescue Me , and Wicked Wicked Games , and even competed on the enormously popular ballroom-dancing competitive reality series Dancing with the Stars in 2006.

{"input": "Question: Whose 1960 recording \u201cThe Twist\u201d spawned a craze for the dance of that name? </s> Context: The History of Dance Craze \"The Twist\" - About.com EducationThe History of Dance Craze \"The Twist\"  By Jennifer Rosenberg  Updated January 03, 2016.  The Twist, a dance done by swiveling the hips, became a worldwide dance craze in the early 1960s . The Twist became extremely popular after Chubby Checker danced the Twist while singing the song of the same name on the Dick Clark Show on August 6, 1960.  Who Invented the Twist?  No one is quite sure who actually started swiveling their hips in this manner; some say it might have been part of an African dance brought to the United States during the slavery era. No matter where it started, it was musician Hank Ballard who first made the dance popular.  Hank Ballard (1927-2003) was an R&B singer who was part of the group called the Midnighters. Ballard wrote and recorded the song, \"The Twist,\" after seeing some people twisting their hips while dancing. The song, \"The Twist,\" was first released on the B-side of Ballard's single \"Teardrops on Your Letter\" album in 1958.  However, Hank Ballard and the Midnighters had a reputation for being a risque band (many of their songs featured explicit lyrics), so it was going to take another singer to take \"The Twist\" to number one on the charts.  continue reading below our video  Test Your General Science Knowledge  Chubby Checker's Twist  It was Dick Clark , famous for his show American Bandstand, who thought that a new singer could make the song and the dance even more popular. Thus, Clark contacted local Philadelphia recording label Cameo/Parkway in the hopes that they would record a new version of the song.  Cameo/Parkway found Chubby Checker. The youthful Chubby Checker created his own version of \"The Twist,\" which was released in the summer of 1960.  On August 6, 1960, Chubby Checker sang and danced his version of \"The Twist\" on Dick Clark's Saturday night program, The Dick Clark Show. The song quickly hit number one on the charts and the dance swept around the world.  In 1962, Chubby Checker's version of \"The Twist\" again hit number one on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, becoming the second song to ever be number one on two separate occasions (Bing Crosby's \"White Christmas\" was the first). In total, Checker's \"The Twist\" spent 25 weeks in the top ten.  How to Do the Twist  The Twist dance was easy to do, which helped make it so popular. It was usually done with a partner, although no touching was involved.  Basically it's a simple twisting of the hips. Some describe it as if you are pretending to stamp out a fallen cigarette or drying your back with a towel.  The dance was so popular that it inspired additional new dances such as the Mashed Potato, the Swim, and the Funky Chicken.

{"input": "Question: Which English cricket captain had a well-publicised row with Pakistani umpire Shakoor Rana in Faisalabad in 1987? </s> Context: Shakoor Rana | Pakistan Cricket | Cricket Players and ...Shakoor Rana | Pakistan Cricket | Cricket Players and Officials | ESPN Cricinfo  ODI statistics  Profile  Shakoor Rana's place in cricket history will be as the umpire who was involved in the infamous slanging match with Mike Gatting which stopped the Faisalabad Test in December, 1987.   The circumstances leading to the exchange are well documented, as are the consequences.  Rana was a genial and popular character who came from a famous sporting family. His brothers Shafqat Rana and Azmat Rana both represented Pakistan in Tests  and a third brother, Sultan Rana, became a cricket administrator and junior national selector. His two sons - Maqsood and Mansoor - also played  first-class cricket.  Rana himself played first-class cricket as a right-hand bat and right-arm medium-fast bowler, but his career was more stop than start and in 12 seasons he made only 11 appearances.   But it was as an umpire he made his name.  His debut was against the West Indies at his home town of Lahore in 1974-75 and his last Test was against New Zealand team on the same ground in 1996-97.  He was a competent umpire, upright and bold in his decision making, but prone to bouts of self-importance.  Before the Gatting incident, he had almost come to blows with Jeremy Coney, New Zealand's captain, over disputed decisions.  But those were rare blemishes against a decent man. It is just a shame that they are what he will generally be remembered for.  Martin Williamson  Shakoor Rana, who died on April 9 six days after his 65th birthday, was cricket's most infamous umpire and, with the exception of Dickie Bird, probably the best known official in the history of the game. His furious finger-wagging exchange with Mike Gatting is among the game's most reproduced images and was even used in countries not known for their cricket, such as Germany, to make of fun of Britain's post-colonial arrogance. Shakoor took great pride in his notoriety and painstakingly pasted into his cuttings book an article from an earlier series describing him as\"The World's Worst Umpire\" He was far from the worst. But he could be authoritarian, temperamental and occasionally overbearing.  England's 1987-88 tour of Pakistan is still best known for his confrontation with Gatting during the second Test at Faisalabad. In the first Test the tourists had copped some dreadful decisions by Shakeel Khan; Shakoor's decisions might not have been so obviously poor, but he dismayed the England players by wearing a Pakistan sweater. When Mudassar Nazar handed him his cap, he promptly put it on his head.  The incident that made him famous came on the second day when Gaffing signalled David Capel to come in no further from deep square-leg as Eddie Hemmings moved in to bowl. Shakoor put his hand up to stop play and then accused Gatting of cheating. The following day was dominated by diplomatic efforts to produce a face-saving apology from both protagonists.  It has always been thought that it was Shakoor, egged on by Javed Miandad, who refused to back down. But Raman Subba Row, chairman of the old TCCB, has a different angle. \"I did my best to broker a mutual apology,\" he remembers. \"Shakoor actually went along with this. But Michael did not.\" In the end Gatting was forced to scribble a note of apology -- which Shakoor treasured so much that he kept it under his pillow. The third day's play was lost, however, and with it England's chance of squaring the series.  There was a sense that Pakistan were nursing a grievance that tour, after their objections to David Constant and Dickie Bird the previous English summer had been ignored. Then there was the interesting case of their unofficial manager Haseeb Ahsan. He toured England as an offspinner in 1962 and took five wickets in the first innings Worcester. His action, however, was questioned in the limes, he did not bow, again because of a sprained ankle, and e. sent home amid some speculation.", "truth": ["mike gatting"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3247", "mistake": "Shakoor Rana", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

While perfecting his secret recipe with 11 herbs and spices, Sanders found that pan frying chicken was too slow, requiring 30 minutes per order. French frying the chicken in a wire basket immersed in deep fat required half the time, but produced dry, unevenly done chicken. In 1939 he found that using a pressure cooker produced tasty, moist chicken in eight or nine minutes. By July 1940 Sanders finalised what came to be known as his Original Recipe.  History and Reception  After Sanders began franchising the chicken in the 1950s as Kentucky Fried Chicken, the company shipped the spices already mixed to restaurants to preserve the recipe\u2019s secrecy. He admitted to the use of salt and pepper in the recipe, and claimed that the ingredients \u201cstand on everybody\u2019s shelf\u201d.  Sanders originally called for the use of vegetable oil for frying chicken. By 1993, for reasons of economy, many KFC outlets had switched to a blend of palm and soybean oil.In Japan, the oil used is mainly the more expensive cottonseed and corn oil, as KFC Japan believes that this offers superior taste quality.  Sanders\u2019 Original Recipe of \u201c11 herbs and spices\u201d is one of the most famous trade secrets in the catering industry. Franchisee Dave Thomas, better known as the founder of Wendy\u2019s, argued that the secret recipe concept was successful because \u201ceverybody wants in on a secret\u201d and former KFC owner John Y. Brown, Jr. called it \u201ca brilliant marketing ploy.\u201d The New York Times described the recipe as one of the company\u2019s most valuable assets. The recipe is not patented, because patents eventually expire, whereas trade secrets can remain the intellectual property of their holders in perpetuity.  KFC uses it as a means to differentiate its product from its competitors. Early franchisee Pete Harman credited the chain\u2019s popularity to the recipe and the product, and John Y. Brown cites the \u201cincredibly tasty, almost addictive\u201d product as the basis of KFC\u2019s staying power. On the other hand, Allen Adamson, managing director of brand consultancy Landor, remains unconvinced about the contribution of the secret formula aspect. He argues: \u201cThe story may still be part of these companies\u2019 folklore, but I\u2019d be surprised if more than 2 percent buy the brand because of it.\u201d  About The Recipe  A copy of the recipe, signed by Sanders, is held inside a safe inside a vault in KFC\u2019s Louisville headquarters, along with eleven vials containing the herbs and spices. To maintain the secrecy of the recipe, half of it is produced by Griffith Laboratories before it is given to McCormick, who add the second half.  In 1983, William Poundstone conducted laboratory research into the coating mix, as described in his book Big Secrets, and claimed that a sample he examined contained only flour, salt, monosodium glutamate and black pepper. KFC maintains that it still adheres to Sanders\u2019 original 1940 recipe. In Todd Wilbur\u2019s television program Top Secret Recipe, the Colonel\u2019s former secretary, Shirley Topmiller, revealed that Sanders learned from his mother that sage and savory are good seasonings for chicken. Also, Winston Shelton, a former friend of the Colonel\u2019s, revealed that the secret recipe contains Tellicherry black pepper.  It is well attested that Harland Sanders asked Bill Summers of Marion-Kay Spices in Brownstown, Indiana, US to recreate his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices. While alive, Sanders recommended the Marion-Kay seasoning to franchisees over the corporate version, as he believed the latter had been made inferior by its owners. In 1982, after Sanders\u2019 death, KFC brought a lawsuit against Marion-Kay", "truth": ["eleven", "11"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7551", "mistake": "11 herbs and spices", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.4}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: By area, what is the biggest country entirely in the Southern Hemisphere? </s> Context: Which countries are in the Southern Hemisphere ...Which countries are in the Southern Hemisphere? | Reference.com  Which countries are in the Southern Hemisphere?  A:  Quick Answer  The Southern Hemisphere contains all or parts of five continents, including all of Antarctica, Australia, almost all of South America, the southern third of Africa and some southern islands in Asia (parts of Indonesia). It also includes four oceans (Indian, South Atlantic, Southern and South Pacific) and a major part of Oceania.  Full Answer  The Southern Hemisphere refers to the southern portion or half of the Earth. It starts at the equator at 0 degrees and stretches south into higher latitudes until it reaches 90 degrees south, also known as the South Pole, which is in the middle of Antarctica. Compared to the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere has fewer land masses and more water.  The South Atlantic, the South Pacific, the Indian Ocean and several seas, including the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand and the Weddell Sea next to Antarctica, constitute approximately 80.9 percent of the Southern Hemisphere. Land constitutes about 19.1 percent. In the Northern Hemisphere, on the other hand, most of the area is comprised of land masses. The climate in the Southern Hemisphere tends to be slightly milder than in the Northern Hemisphere at the same latitudes, with the exception of the Antarctic, which is colder than the Arctic. The milder climate is due to the presence of more oceans and much less land.  Which continents are located entirely in the Northern ...Which continents are located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere? | Reference.com  Which continents are located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere?  A:  Quick Answer  The continents of North America and Europe are the only two continents that lie completely within the Northern Hemisphere. Also located in the Northern Hemisphere are about two-thirds of the African continent, most of Asia and the northern most section of South America.  Full Answer  Directly below 0 degrees latitude lies the Southern Hemisphere, which holds most of South America's land mass, a small amount of Asian islands, Australia, around one-third of Africa and the entire freezing continent of Antarctica. Climates vary between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the hotter summer months in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in June and ending in September. The Southern Hemisphere experiences its hot summers from December until the end of March.

A scene from To the Manor Born\u00a0  Nigel Farndale  12:01AM GMT 02 Dec 2007  Its snooty humour worked well in the 1980s. But on the eve of a Christmas special, Nigel Farndale asks whether To the Manor Born still cuts it  Christmas TV highlights | Michael Parkinson | Star Wars special | Noel Streatfeild's Ballet Shoes | Dr Who special  What intrigues most about To the Manor Born is not how dated it seems now, but how dated it seemed then - then being 1979, when the first episode was shown.  It seemed to represent a world of snobbery that belonged to a more complacent and twee era. Possibly the 1950s. Certainly not the radical, anarchic, politically charged decade that had just thrown up, in every sense, The Sex Pistols.  But I'm getting ahead of myself here. I should explain why I've spent the past two days watching old episodes of this sitcom, which ended in 1981 after three series, in order to analyse why it remains relevant.  The BBC has made an hour-long, one-off special of To the Manor Born to be shown this Christmas. Indeed, it is the highlight of the BBC's Christmas schedule. Surely I'm not alone in asking why.  Actually, it is obvious why, on one level. TTMB, as the To The Manor Born International Appreciation Society's website likes to call it, used to get seriously good ratings. One episode (not its last, contrary to popular myth) managed to draw in 23\u00b795 million viewers, enough to make it the fourth most watched programme in the 1970s.  There is a rumour that the last episode pulled in 27 million - one that is repeated in the 'extras' sections of the DVD boxset - but it's nothing more than a rumour. Not that it matters, because 23\u00b795 million is absurdly high anyway. To give that figure some kind of perspective, in these days of digital, multi-channel viewing, the highest-rated shows on television will average six million viewers.  The show was a phenomenon, then. It was even big in America, a land where stereotypes of Englishness always go down well. Marlon Brando had a collection of To the Manor Born videos at his home in Los Angeles. No really, he did.  But there are other less obvious reasons why this new episode might have been commissioned now, after so long. Before I hazard what they are it will be as well to remind ourselves of the plot.  Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, played by Penelope Keith, lives in Grantleigh Manor. She is an aristocrat. She is a snob. She has a cold heart. When her husband dies, she is delighted - 'My late, dear, dead loss' she calls him - until she finds out that he was bankrupt. She has to sell the Grantleigh estate and, with her faithful retainer, Brabinger, move out of the house and into the cottage at the end of the drive.  From this vantage point she is able to keep a close and disapproving eye on the estate's new owner, the nouveau-riche Richard DeVere, a wholesale foods magnate played by Peter Bowles. DeVere and fforbes-Hamilton have a love-hate relationship, which is eventually resolved in the 1981 finale, in which they marry.  Although, as I've said, Audrey fforbes-Hamilton seemed like an anachronism back in 1979, she was, actually, quite modern. It was the beginning of the era of Thatcherism, the age of the dominant female; of The Great She Elephant. The bossy, blonde Audrey was clearly a version of Thatcher. 'We've been here through floods, famines and Labour governments,' she says at one point.  On another occasion she laments: 'I'm not normally given to crying.

The Iraqi dictator took the world by surprise when he annexed his neighbor, which until recently had been his ally. \u00a0Iraq\u2019s tiny, oil-rich neighbor.

In 1990 Iraq had one of the biggest\u00a0armies in the world and had just emerged from a brutal war with Iran. Soon the Iraqi army was in control of the tiny country. The world condemned the invasion and saw it as an act of brutal aggression.  Why did Sadam Hussein the Iraqi leader, invade his neighbor. Firstly, Iraq had long regarded the country as part of its historic territory. During the Iran-Iraq war, Kuwait had helped to finance Iraq\u2019s war efforts. It had lent Baghdad billions of dollars. After the end of the war in 1988, Kuwait demanded its money back. This enraged the Iraqi dictator because he believed that he had been defending Sunni Arab nations from Shite and Persian Iran. Also, Iraq had no real access to the Persian Gulf and it wanted a significant port.  President George Bush visiting troops during Desert Shield.  By invading Kuwait, Iraq gained control of twenty percent \u00a0of the world\u2019s oil supplies. If Iraq was allowed to keep its conquest then it could dictate to the world the price of oil. This was not acceptable to America or Europe. \u00a0On the 2nd of August, the United Nations Security Council \u00a0demanded Iraq withdraw all its military forces from Kuwait. The country was immediately placed under a strict sanctions regime.  The small country was occupied by the Iraqi military and any opposition to the occupiers was brutally suppressed.  Iraq believed that the world would do nothing. It expected helped from the Soviet Union. They believed that Moscow would not let America expel them from Kuwait. However, this was a miscalculation. Moscow was in crisis and the Soviet Union was in crisis and it would eventually collapse the year later.  In response\u00a0to the invasion, the UN empowered the Americans to lead an international coalition against the Iraqis. Washington announced Operation\u00a0Desert Shield. Its immediate aim was to protect Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia, which was defenseless\u00a0before the might of the Iraqi army.  General Norman Schwarkorpff was made commander of the coalition of international military forces. In February 1991, the international coalition launched Operation Desert Storm.

Caption  Hasbro  2015: The 80th anniversary edition of Monopoly contains one iconic token from each of the 8 decades: bathtub, locomotive, money bag, cat, cannon, cavalry and Monopoly World Championships trophy.  Designed by Philadelphia native Charles Darrow and based on the streets of Atlantic City, New Jersey, Monopoly was a cultural phenomenon when it hit store shelves back in 1935.  Eighty years later, the fast-dealing property trading game is still gathering steam. We're talking B&O Railroad in its heyday steam.  \"Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200\" is so ubiquitous, that uttering it outside a game of Monopoly does not necessitate an explanation.  So let's start at the beginning, shall we? Pick a token (dibs on the Scottie dog!), decide who's going to be banker and grab your initial $1,500.  Darrow had made a prototype in 1933 using materials from around his home. The board was fashioned out of a piece of oilcloth that had been a table covering. Darrow cut the houses and hotels out of scraps of wooden molding by hand and typed up the deeds and cards himself. The very first tokens were actual charms from his niece\u2019s charm bracelet.  When Darrow first attempted to sell Monopoly to Parker Brothers, he was rejected for \u201c52 fundamental errors\u201d that included the game\u2019s length, theme and complexity. Undaunted, Darrow secured a copyright, manufactured the game himself and sold it through department stores in Philadelphia. When locals began raving about the game, Parker Brothers reconsidered.  Parker Brothers acquired the rights to Monopoly from Darrow in March 1935 and began selling. The price? A cool $2.  The original game included 10 metal tokens: iron, purse, lantern, racecar, thimble, shoe, top hat, battleship, cannon and rocking horse.  Within a year of Monopoly's release, 35,000 copies were being produced each week.  It didn\u2019t take long for Monopoly to go global. International licensing rights were first granted to Waddington\u2019s in London. For the first time, property names were changed to reflect well-known streets in London. The practice continues today whenever Monopoly is introduced to a new country.  In 2013, Parker Brothers\u2019 parent company, Hasbro rallied fans around the world to save their favorite game token from being replaced. Ultimately, fans voted out the iron token and welcomed the cat token as a permanent new addition to the classic game.  The current standard edition of Monopoly consists of eight tokens: battleship, top hat, Scottie dog, racecar, thimble, book, cat and wheelbarrow.  In its 80 years, Monopoly has racked up over 1 billion players in 114 countries. It\u2019s currently published in 47 languages and carried by more than 10,000 retail stores. The rules have remained virtually unchanged the entire time.  Hasbro is celebrating Monopoly\u2019s milestone with a special 80th anniversary edition. In France, Hasbro replaced paper Monopoly money with real euros in 80 sets scattered throughout 30,000 Monopoly boxes on French store shelves. One set\u2019s money consists entirely of real cash, totaling over $23,000.  Mr. Monopoly (birth name: Milburn Pennybags, aka Rich Uncle Pennybags) is the game\u2019s longstanding mascot. The real estate tycoon spoke to HLN about the game\u2019s longtime universal appeal.  \u201cCelebrating the Monopoly game\u2019s 80th anniversary is better than winning first prize in a beauty contest! I\u2019ve been witness to eight amazing decades of families and fans passing GO, choosing favorite tokens, and becoming real estate tycoons. The Monopoly game is still on a \u2018roll\u2019 in 2015.

CONTACT  Three Pieces for Clarinet  \u00a0  Russian-born Igor Stravinsky (1182-1971) is included among the Time 100, Time magazine's list of the most influential people of the 20th Century. Stravinsky shot to international fame with his early ballets, The Firebird (1910), and Petrushka (1911), and his revolutionary The Rite of Spring (1913) ushered in Modernism and forever changed the way composers regarded rhythmic structures.  Stravinsky moved his family to Switzerland soon after The Firebird premiered in Paris and he developed an artistic partnership with Swiss philanthropist Werner Reinhart (1884-1951), who provided Stravinsky with financial backing for another revolutionary work, The Soldier's Tale (1918). Reinhart was himself an amateur clarinetist, and in gratitude Stravinsky composed for him the Three Pieces for Clarinet (1918, published 1919). The first movement, \"always soft and very tranquil,\" is contemplative and exploits the instruments low register; the 2nd is written without barlines and is improvisatory in character; and the 3rd movement rather recalls the dance styles (i.e., Ragtime and Tango) used in The Soldier's Tale.  ................................................Introduction\u2014The Firebird and Its Dance\u2014The Firebird's Variation  ................................................The Princesses\u2019 Khorovod (Round Dance)  ................................................Infernal Dance of King Kashchei  ................................................Berceuse (Lullaby)  ................................................Finale  When Igor Stravinsky wakened on June 25, 1910, he was virtually unknown, but by the following morning he had become one of the most celebrated composers in Europe. His overnight success came with the premiere of\u00a0The Firebird, the first original score commissioned by Serge Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes.\u00a0  The dance company had dazzled Paris the previous year, but none of its first-season productions featured newly-composed music. For the second season, choreographer Michel Fokine and production designer Alexandre Benois devised an original scenario combining two characters from Slavic folklore. One is\u00a0Zhar-ptitsa, the shimmering Firebird whose magic can bring either good fortune or bad. The other is the ogre-demon Kashchei the Deathless, whose back-story hobbies include kidnapping princesses and turning would-be rescuer knights into stone.  Since no fairytale is complete without a prince in tights, the story begins with the\u00a0Introduction\u00a0of Ivan Tsarevich lurking through the shadows.\u00a0 We can tell he is a good guy because he gave his entourage the night off, but the spooky music suggests that that might not have been a good idea. He spiesThe Firebird and Its Dance\u00a0(with\u00a0The Firebird's Variation). The Firebird flutters about erratically, but nonetheless is very beautiful, and shiny. Being a prince, Ivan knows that shiny is good, so he sneaks up and captures her.\u00a0 But being a hero, he lets her go when she begs for mercy. Before disappearing the Firebird gives Ivan a magic feather that can summon her if needed.\u00a0 Into the orchard tiptoe thirteen princesses bandying golden apples. Though obviously not condemned to hard labor, they are prisoners of Kashchei.\u00a0 Ivan joins them in\u00a0The Princesses\u2019 Khorovod, a circle-dance on the Russian folk song,\u00a0In the Garden\u00a0(introduced by solo oboe). The romantic reverie is interrupted by Kashchei and his minions, who capture Ivan. Before Kashchei can add Ivan to his collection of stone guests, the prince whips out the magic feather and the Firebird reappears. She casts a spell over the inhospitable horde, compelling them to dance the\u00a0Infernal Dance of King Kashchei\u00a0to exhaustion; she then lulls them to sleep with a\u00a0Berceuse.\u00a0 While Kashchei snoozes, the Firebird reveals a giant egg that contains the demon's soul.

The statement came as the top UN human rights official issued a report saying the Rohingya had been deprived of nationality and undergone systematic discrimination and severe restrictions on movements.

The term is a divisive issue.  The UN human rights investigator, Yanghee Lee, met Aung San Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyitaw on her first trip to Myanmar since the Nobel Peace Prize winner took power in April.  \u201cAt their meeting here this morning, our foreign minister Daw Aung San Suu Kyi explained our stance on this issue that the controversial terms should be avoided,\u201d said Aung Lin, the permanent secretary at the ministry of foreign affairs.  Aung San Suu Kyi is banned from presidency by the military-drafted constitution because her children have British citizenship. She holds offices of the state counsellor and the minister for foreign affairs, but is the de facto leader of the administration.  Feted in the west for her role as champion of Myanmar\u2019s democratic opposition during long years of military rule and house arrest, Suu Kyi has been criticised overseas , and by some in Myanmar, for saying little about the abuses faced by the Rohingya.  Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, UN high commissioner for human rights said in the report the Rohingya were excluded from a number of professions and needed special paperwork to access hospitals, which has resulted in delays and deaths of babies and their mothers during childbirth.  It was the first time Zeid said these and other long-standing violations could add up to crimes against humanity, an international crime. Crimes against humanity are serious, widespread and systematic violations.  Some 120,000 Rohingya remain displaced in squalid camps since fighting erupted in Rakhine State between Buddhists and Muslims in 2012. Thousands have fled persecution and poverty.  \u201cThe new Government has inherited a situation where laws and policies are in place that are designed to deny fundamental rights to minorities, and where impunity for serious violations against such communities has encouraged further violence against them,\u201d Zeid said.

{"input": "Question: Which Australian cricketer in his very last innings in 1948 scored a duck (0)? </s> Context: Don Bradman scores a second-ball duck in his farewell Test ...Don Bradman scores a second-ball duck in his farewell Test innings | Zee News  Don Bradman scores a second-ball duck in his farewell Test innings  Last Updated: Wednesday, August 14, 2013 - 18:16  0  Follow @ZeeNews  Arunabha Sengupta  August 14, 1948. England were skittled out for 52 by a lethal Ray Lindwall, following which Don Bradman fell for the most infamous duck in the history of cricket. Arunabha Sengupta remembers the day when the great man played his last Test innings, stopping short of 7,000 Test runs and an average of 100 by four runs.  Arthur Morris ended the day on 77. After the sun had worked its magic on the rest day rendering it ideal for batting, the left handed Australian opener carried his score to 196.  On the first day, Eric Hollies bowled perhaps the best delivery of his life \u2014 a googly.  However, in spite of their commendable deeds, the applause of the match was reserved for the most famous duck of all time. And the best innings was played not by Morris but the man to whom Don Bradman passed his mantle of the best batsman of the world. Len Hutton was exceptional as he scored 30 in the paltry England total of 52.  As he went out to toss, Bradman averaged 101.39. His previous Test innings at The Oval fetched him 232, 244 and 77. In 1948, he had already batted twice on the ground against Surrey, and had scored 146 and 128. All he needed was four runs to complete 7000 Test runs and end with a career batting average of 100. Sadly, he finished four short. As Jack Fingleton later observed: \u201cThe game that had given him so much had denied him at the very last Test appearance.\u201d  The Lindwall spell  On that Saturday, Bradman lost the flip of the coin and Norman Yardley decided to bat. The wicket was saturated with overnight rain, but the England captain was not really left with an option. With more rain in the air and uncertainty surrounding the conditions, the decision was inevitable.  And on that sodden wicket, Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Bill Johnston maintained a stranglehold on the English batsmen for 42 overs and one ball before the pitiful innings ended for a miserable 52. It was England\u2019s lowest total since they had been routed for 45 by Charlie Turner and JJ Ferris at Sydney in 1887. England had ended up winning that Test by 13 runs. Nothing of that sort was about to happen in this one.  Lindwall varied his pace superbly, mixing it up with his occasional express delivery. The ball rose to different heights while seldom deviating from the line of the stumps. Norman Yardley, Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Jack Young were bowled, all gingerly hesitant to come forward. Allan Watkins was struck on the shoulder and his abilities as a bowler was taken out of the equation for the Test match. After lunch Lindwall\u2019s figures read 8.1-4-8-5.  And all through this tale of plight, Hutton demonstrated absolute mastery. With class written over each and every stroke, he proceeded untroubled to 30. And then, with the last man at the other end, he essayed a perfectly genuine leg-glance off an express Lindwall delivery down the leg side. Behind the wicket Don Tallon took off in a spectacular dive and took the ball at full stretch with his left glove. \u201cA great finish to Australia\u2019s splendid performance,\u201d wrote Wisden. Hutton scored just 30, but it must rank as one of the very best innings he ever played in his illustrious career.

{"input": "Question: The oak furniture maker Robert Thompson included a carving of which animal on almost every piece he made from the 1920s until his death in 1955? </s> Context: Robert Thompson (designer)Robert (Mouseman) Thompson (7 May 1876 \u2013 8 December 1955) was a British furniture maker. He lived in Kilburn, North Yorkshire, where he set up a business manufacturing oak furniture, which featured a carved mouse on almost every piece. It is claimed that the mouse motif came about accidentally in 1919 following a conversation about \"being as poor as a church mouse\", which took place between Thompson and one of his colleagues during the carving of a cornice for a screen. This chance remark led to him carving a mouse and this remained part of his work from this point onwards.  He was part of the 1920s revival of craftsmanship, inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement led by William Morris, John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle. More specific to furniture making in this genre and era include Stanley Webb Davies of Windermere.  The workshop, now being run by his descendants, includes a showroom and visitors' centre, and is located beside the Parish Church, which contains \"Mouseman\" pews, fittings and other furniture. The company is now known as \"Robert Thompson's Craftsmen Ltd - The Mouseman of Kilburn.\"  Fr Paul Nevill, a former Headmaster of Ampleforth College, asked Thompson to make the Ampleforth Abbey's furniture; they liked it so much that Ampleforth kept asking Thompson for more works, including the library and most of the main building. Fr Gabriel Everitt, current Headmaster, has recently asked the Mouseman company for more work. Most of Ampleforth College houses are decorated with Robert Thompson's furniture.  Others who continue in his style working in Yorkshire oak, have adopted similar identifying marks and nicknames, for example Thomas \"Gnomeman\" Whittaker (1910-1991), Colin \"Beaverman\" Almack, Wilf \"Squirrelman\" Hutchinson, Albert \"Eagleman\" Jeffray, Malcolm \"Foxman\" Pipes et al..

{"input": "Question: What is vellum parchment made from ? </s> Context: What Is Vellum Paper ? | eHowWhat Is Vellum Paper? | eHow  What Is Vellum Paper?  Nastco/iStock/Getty Images  Vellum is a type of parchment, which is an animal skin that was traditionally used as a writing material for important documents such as land records, religious texts and public laws. Parchment could be made from the hides of goats, calves or sheep. Vellum, however, referred specifically to a writing material made from calf skin.  Vegetable Vellum  Animal vellum is rarely used in the 21st century. During the late 1800s, a durable, translucent, slightly glossy paper was created that simulated the appearance of calf-skin vellum. This ivory-colored paper stock, which is made from cotton fibers and wood pulp, is available in two varieties. Bristol vellum, or vellum-surface bristol, is a thick variety that is commonly used for art media such as pastels, paint or ink. Drafting or design vellum is semi-transparent, which makes it useful for technical drawing.

Tweet  Vellum & Parchment \u2013 The Traditional (Animal) Version  Historically, parchment was made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame and processing it in preparation for writing. While parchment was a generic term for any animal skin treated in this manner, the term vellum referred specifically to calf skin. Parchment was made with longevity in mind and was therefore used for important documents such as laws, legal records and the United States Constitution.  Though animal-based parchment is still manufactured today, it is a very time consuming and expensive process, leaving modern parchment to be made with cellulose fibers (trees and plants) and machinery. While the traditional and modern versions share similar tactile properties, naturally, they look very different.  The Modern (Plant) Version  LCI offers both translucent vellum and parchment papers . Though the two are both lightweight, translucent sheets that can be used for the same applications, there are aesthetic differences.  Vellum \u2013 Offered in a Colorful Variety  Translucent vellum has the appearance of frosted or stained glass and has a smooth, almost plastic-like finish.  A more \u201ccrafty\u201d paper, so to speak, it is offered in a variety of colors, weights, textures and even envelopes. Vellum is a favorite of the scrapbooking world, but is also a great addition to invitations, programs, greeting cards, decor, and more.  Parchment \u2013 A Traditional Palette  European parchment has a cloudy appearance that offers less clarity than vellum. It is offered in one 24lb translucent weight and in just two colors \u2013 white and ivory.  Parchment is slightly softer and more porous than vellum as well. Combined with its classic color palette, these sheets are perfect for any design that requires a touch of tradition and elegance.  Differences between Parchment, Vellum and PaperDifferences between Parchment, Vellum and Paper | National Archives  Technical Information  Differences between Parchment, Vellum and Paper  The term parchment is a general term for an animal skin which has  been prepared for writing or printing. Parchment has been made for centuries,  and is usually calf, goat, or sheep skin. The term vellum from the  French veau refers  to a parchment made from calf skin. The manufacture  of parchment is quite involved. After the skin is removed from the animal and  any hair or flesh is cleaned away, it is stretched on a wooden frame. While it  is stretched, the parchment maker or parchminer scrapes the surface of  the skin with a special curved knife. In order to create tension in the skin,  scraping is alternated by wetting and drying the skin. The parchment is scraped,  wetted, and dried several times to bring it to the right thickness and tautness.  Sometimes a final finish is achieved using pumice as an abrasive followed by  chalk in order to prepare the surface of the skin to accept ink.

{"input": "Question: Which film sees Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and Donald Sutherland as retired astronauts? </s> Context: Space Cowboys by Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald ...Space Cowboys by Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James Garner | 883929078080 | DVD | Barnes & Noble\u00ae  Videos  Overview  In this adventure drama, four men passed over by the space program get one last chance to be heroes and live out their dreams. Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland), and Tank Sullivan (James Garner) were top pilots within an elite Air Force squadron and on the fast track to becoming the first Americans in space in the early 1950s. However, when NASA was established, the pilots were cut out of the loop; Corvin went on to become an aerospace engineer, Hawkins continued on as a freelance pilot, O'Neill became an astrophysicist with a sideline in designing roller coasters, and Sullivan took up preaching as a Baptist minister. Years later, a Russian satellite's guidance system has started to malfunction, and it is expected to crash into the Earth within a matter of weeks. The system is identical to the one Corvin designed for Skylab, so NASA head Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) asks Corvin to help him with the emergency mission to repair the satellite. Corvin agrees under one condition -- that he be sent up to do the repairs himself, with Hawkins, O'Neill, and Sullivan as his crew. Clint Eastwood directed Space Cowboys while also starring as Frank Corvin; his supporting cast includes Marcia Gay Harden, Courtney B. Vance, Loren Dean, and William Devane.  Advertising  Editorial Reviews  Barnes & Noble  - Ed Hulse  A quartet of aging but still popular stars strut their stuff in Space Cowboys, a rollicking adventure film that delivers a playful poke in the eye to youth-obsessed Hollywood. Clint Eastwood , Tommy Lee Jones , James Garner , and Donald Sutherland -- representing 150 combined years of experience in front of the camera -- play retired Air Force men who washed out of America\u2019s space program four decades earlier. Their collective expertise in now-obsolete computer technology suddenly makes these geriatric flyers invaluable: Repairs are desperately needed on a failing, missile-loaded Russian satellite, and the old-timers are launched into space to do what the younger astronauts can\u2019t. Eastwood, who also directs, depicts the space program\u2019s training regimen with a documentarian's fidelity and elicits laughs by showing himself and his costars huffing their ways through its rigors. The film\u2019s character-driven script provides each of the veteran stars with pithy dialogue and scene-stealing moments, and their spirited interplay is even more entertaining than the mission itself. There\u2019s no shortage of action, thrills, or suspense, but Space Cowboys is also warmly humorous, wistful, and elegiac, and thus ranks among Eastwood\u2019s best movies. DVD supplements include behind-the-scenes footage, documentaries (covering both the film\u2019s production and NASA\u2019s operations), theatrical trailers, special DVD-ROM content, and web access.  All Movie Guide  - Karl Williams  An unusually populist comedy for a director of such normally refined tastes, this geriatric space adventure from Clint Eastwood spoofs the aging of the Baby Boomer generation with broad appeal, but flags in its poorly structured third act. While Space Cowboys gets off to an interesting start in a flashback sequence that casts lookalike actors with their voices dubbed by the film's stars, the story's central conceit (four aging would-be astronauts getting one last chance to blast off) is exhaustively rehashed, making for a tiring set-up. Once the quartet of creaking seniors is in training for their mission, however, the film finds its legs and purpose, sending up the idea of vitamin-popping oldsters rediscovering their right stuff with zeal and relish. When its characters finally achieve orbit, the film loses its way again, stumbling with a subplot involving an egotistical young colleague who botches a job and the unexpected illness of a central figure. Nevertheless, Space Cowboys is about two-thirds of a fine and enjoyably risible comedy that is a bounce back for Eastwood after stumbling badly with his last directorial effort, True Crime", "truth": ["space cowboys"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-246", "mistake": "Space Cowboys", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

{"input": "Question: During World War II, Japan occupied which part of the USA? </s> Context: World War II: War Comes to the United States - InfopleaseWorld War II: War Comes to the United States  World War II  War Comes to the United States  Though determined to maintain its neutrality, the United States was gradually drawn closer to the war by the force of events. To save Britain from collapse the Congress voted lend-lease aid early in 1941. In Aug., 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met Churchill on the high seas, and together they formulated the Atlantic Charter as a general statement of democratic aims. To establish bases to protect its shipping from attacks by German submarines, the United States occupied (Apr., 1941) Greenland and later shared in the occupation of Iceland; despite repeated warnings, the attacks continued. Relations with Germany became increasingly strained, and the aggressive acts of Japan in China, Indochina, and Thailand provoked protests from the United States.  Efforts to reach a peaceful settlement were ended on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japan without warning attacked Pearl Harbor , the Philippines, and Malaya. War was declared (Dec. 8) on Japan by the United States, the Commonwealth of Nations (except Ireland), and the Netherlands. Within a few days Germany and Italy declared war on the United States.  The first phase of the war in the Pacific was disastrous for the Allies. Japan swiftly conquered the Philippines (where strong resistance ended at Corregidor), Malaya, Burma (Myanmar), Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia), and many Pacific islands; destroyed an Allied fleet in the Java Sea; and reached, by mid-1942, its furthest points of advance in the Aleutian Islands and New Guinea.  Australia became the chief Allied base for the countermoves against Japan, directed by Gen. Douglas MacArthur , Admiral Nimitz , and Admiral Halsey . The first Allied naval successes against Japan were scored in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, where U.S. bombers knocked out the major part of Japan's carrier fleet and forced Japan into retreat. Midway was the first decisive blow against the Axis by Allied forces. On land the Allies took the offensive in New Guinea and landed (Aug. 7, 1942) on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.  Sections in this article:  World War IIWorld War\u00a0II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations\u2014including all of the great powers\u2014eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki),  it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War\u00a0II the deadliest conflict in human history.  The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937, but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939  with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland, Finland, Romania and the Baltic states.

With the recent Trojan limited edition 7 inch of \u201cDouble Barrel Man\u201d and their reunion earlier this year it seems like a good time to highlight the original collection of tunes on Double Barrel.  An international sensation was born with the release of Dave and Ansell Collins\u2019 \u201cDouble Barrel\u201d in 1971 which hit #1 in the UK. Not only was it a international hit getting release in the US it even featured the first recording for a then 14 year old drumming maestro named Sly Dunbar! For the longest time it was thought by those not familiar with the pair that they were actually brothers since the album failed to include Barker\u2019s last name on the cover.  The single reached #1 on the UK singles charts in April of 1971 (then credited to Dave and Ansil Collins) and even reached the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the US peaking at #22.  \u201cDouble Barrel\u201d and it\u2019s follow up \u201cMonkey Spanner,\u201d were both released on the Techniques label produced by Winston Riley (formerly of the Techniques hence the name of the label). With the song a hit a collection of tracks featuring the duo was put together. The hits did not follow much after these initial gems though and the duo soon split.  The album has been reissued a number of times over the years of course befitting the hugely international hit. Just look at that cover! Why wouldn\u2019t it be a hit?

He was 74.  (credit: Evan Agostini/Getty Images)  NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Percy Sledge, who soared from part-time singer and hospital orderly to lasting fame with his aching, forlorn performance on the classic \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman,\u201d died Tuesday in Louisiana. He was 74.  Dr. William \u201cBeau\u201d Clark, coroner for East Baton Rouge Parish, confirmed to The Associated Press that Sledge died early Tuesday morning, about an hour after midnight, of natural causes in hospice care.  A No. 1 hit in 1966, \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was Sledge\u2019s debut single, an almost unbearably heartfelt ballad with a resonance he never approached again. Few singers could have. Its mood set by a mournful organ and dirge-like tempo, \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was for many the definitive soul ballad, a testament of blinding, all-consuming love haunted by fear and graced by overwhelming emotion.  \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was a personal triumph for Sledge , who seemed on the verge of sobbing throughout the production, and a breakthrough for Southern soul. It was the first No. 1 hit from Alabama\u2019s burgeoning Muscle Shoals music scene, where Aretha Franklin and the Rolling Stones among others would record, and the first gold record for Atlantic Records.  Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler later called the song \u201ca transcendent moment\u201d and \u201ca holy love hymn.\u201d Sledge\u2019s hit became a standard that sustained his long touring career in the U.S., Europe and South Africa, when he averaged 100 performances a year, and led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. It was a favorite at weddings \u2014 Sledge himself did the honors at a ceremony for musician and actor Steve Van Zandt \u2014 and often turned up in movies, including \u201cThe Big Chill,\u201d \u201dThe Crying Game\u201d and a 1994 Meg Ryan drama named for the song\u2019s title.  \u201cWhen a Man Loves a Woman\u201d was re-released after being featured in Oliver Stone\u2019s Vietnam War film \u201cPlatoon\u201d in 1987 and reached No. 2 in Britain. Michael Bolton topped the charts in the 1990s with a cover version and Rolling Stone magazine later ranked it No. 53 on its list of the greatest songs of all time.  Recognizable by his wide, gap-toothed smile, Sledge had a handful of other hits between 1966 and 1968, including \u201cWarm and Tender Love,\u201d \u201dIt Tears Me Up,\u201d \u201dOut of Left Field\u201d and \u201cTake Time to Know Her.\u201d He returned to the charts in 1974 with \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Everything.\u201d  Percy Sledge, who sang 'When a Man Loves a Woman,' diesPercy Sledge, who sang 'When a Man Loves a Woman,' dies  FacebookEmail Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Pinterest  Percy Sledge, who sang 'When a Man Loves a Woman,' dies  A No. 1 hit in 1966, \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" was Percy Sledge's debut single, a heartfelt ballad with a resonance that led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.

Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome circa 700 BC, added the two months Januarius (January), dedicated to Janus, the two-faced god of beginnings and endings, and Februarius (February), named after Februalia, a time of sacrifices to atone for sins.

The race is the most prestigious race for staying Flat horses in Europe and is traditionally held on the third day \u2013 known as Ladies\u2019 Day \u2013 at Royal Ascot. The Queen traditionally presents the Gold Cup. The trophy is made every year and presented to the winning owners to keep.  The 2010 race will be run on Thursday, June 17.  Follow the Racing Post's horse racing news coverage of the race to find out who this year's winner will be.  Ascot Gold Cup History  The Gold Cup was first run in 1807, when the race was run over two miles and was open to three-year-olds and above. In 1808 the race distance was changed to two miles four furlongs.  For many years the race was among the most prestigious races in the Flat calendar and was one of the main objectives of horses who had won the Derby. The last Derby winner to win the Gold Cup was Ocean Swell, while the last Derby winner to run in the Gold Cup was Blakeney, who finished second in 1970.  During the First World War the Gold Cup did not take place in 1915 and 1916 and was held at Newmarket in 1917 and 1918. The race was cancelled again in 1940 following the outbreak of the Second World War and took place at Newmarket from 1941 to 1944.  Ascot Racecourse  Ascot Racecourse  Ascot is one of the world's leading racecourses and is most famous as the home of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting held each June. Founded in 1711 by Queen Anne, Ascot continues to receive royal patronage and plays host to some of the biggest Flat races, including the Gold Cup, Queen Anne Stakes, Prince of Wales's Stakes, Golden Jubilee Stakes (all at the royal meeting), King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.  Ascot racecourse stages jump racing during the winter months, with the main events being the Long Walk Hurdle in December, the Victor Chandler Chase in January and the Ascot Chase in February (all Grade 1 races).  Gold Cup Facts  Bachelor\u2019s Button\u2019s defeat of Pretty Polly in the 1906 race ranks as one of the greatest upsets in the race. The five-year-old Pretty Polly, who had won 22 of her 23 starts including the 1,000 Guineas , Oaks and the St Leger at the age of three, started at odds of 4-11 but suffered from a wart on her belly and did not enjoy the sweltering heat. In the race the mare was outstayed by Bachelor\u2019s Button.  The 1964 race was abandoned due to waterlogging.  Rock Roi was first past the post in the 1971 and 1972 races, but was disqualified both times; for testing positive for bute in 1971 and for causing interference the following year.  Royal Gait was first past the post in 1988 but was controversially disqualified by the stewards for causing interference and placed last, with Sadeem promoted to first place. Royal Gait subsequently won the Champion Hurdle in 1992.  Indian Queen, the 1991 winner, was pregnant when she won the race, having been mated with the stallion Night Shift earlier in the year. She is the last filly or mare to win the race.  The 2005 race was held at York during redevelopment of the Ascot grandstand.

{"input": "Question: Which Olympic event covers the longest distance? </s> Context: Determining Your Long Training Run For Any Triathlon DistanceDetermining Your Long Training Run For Any Triathlon Distance | Triathlete.com  Determining Your Long Training Run For Any Triathlon Distance  Run By Mario Fraioli Updated On: Oct 24, 2012  Photo: Nils Nilsen/Xterra  How far is far enough? This is the question that troubles most triathletes when it comes time to plan the long run in their training program.  Regardless of your race distance, there\u2019s probably a long run penciled somewhere into your weekly training schedule. How long you should go depends largely on the distance of your primary race, as well as whom you ask.  At Ironman Lake Placid in July, 24-year-old Patrick Wheeler made a huge breakthrough at the 140.6-mile distance, winning his age group in just his second Ironman and finishing in 9:49:51. He capped off his stellar day with a solid 3:10:29 marathon, the 13th fastest among the field of 2,258 finishers. His longest single run in training before Lake Placid.  \u201cTwo-and-a-half hours,\u201d Wheeler admits. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my longest continuous run of the year.\u201d  As an athlete and coach for the Boston-based Quantitative Triathlon Training Systems, Wheeler and his colleagues employ a unique approach to run training, capping an athlete\u2019s single longest run for an Ironman at two-and-a-half hours, regardless of his or her ability level.  \u201cMost athletes we coach are between 2:10 and 2:15; some are only around two hours,\u201d Wheeler says. \u201cObviously, the more durable a person is and the longer they\u2019ve been doing it, the closer to the higher end of that range they\u2019ll be, but the main goal is to get someone to a point where we feel they\u2019re durable enough to finish the whole thing.\u201d  In an effort to keep the quality of the long-run days high and instances of injury to a minimum, the coaches of QT2 Systems de-emphasize a single weekly long run in favor of a non-traditional \u201csplit\u201d long run that is used throughout the training cycle. For more experienced, higher-volume athletes, that means two 90-minute runs in a given day, with the second run preceded by an easy 60-minute bike ride. Wheeler says that by splitting the long run into shorter segments with a few hours of recovery in between, athletes are better able to practice running with good form, as well as prime their bodies for the physical and nutritional demands of an all-day event.  \u201cIt\u2019s to hit that second run already beat up and to force yourself physically and mentally to focus and run with good form,\u201d Wheeler explains. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to feel as bad as the last 10K in the Ironman, but it\u2019s pretty close. It\u2019s also to help force your stomach to get used taking in food, digesting food and working out basically all day long.\u201d  There\u2019s more than one way to get to the finish line, however, as Will Kirousis and Jason Gootman of Tri-Hard Endurance Sports Coaching will tell you. For the Ironman, Kirousis caps the long run for his athletes at 20 miles. Beyond that, he says, the risks outweigh the rewards.  \u201cThat\u2019s where the break point is,\u201d Kirousis says. \u201cSomewhere in that 16- to 20-mile range for the vast majority of people is enough. Going over that, you\u2019re really just increasing the chances you\u2019re going to get hurt. Does another two miles really make you a better runner at that point?\u201d  Differing from the QT2 philosophy of run training based around a single long run of up to two-and-a-half hours or split runs totaling up to three hours, Kirousis and Gootman prefer to assign their athletes\u2019 long runs in mileage rather than minutes, citing the confidence of being able to complete a percentage of the marathon distance in training as a key factor in an athlete\u2019s success on race day.  \u201cThere are some people who would say don\u2019t go any longer than 2:45 or three hours, regardless of what", "truth": ["marathon", "marathoners"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3291", "mistake": "The main goal is to get someone to a point where we feel they\u2019re durable enough to finish the whole thing.", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

Now here\u2019s the number. In a press release dated July 17th, 2015, EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), and Sony Pictures Entertainment have announced that the World Premiere of the new James Bond film SPECTRE will take place in London on Monday, October 26th, 2015.  And, for the first time ever, the new 007 movie will open on the same night at cinemas across the UK and Ireland, providing audiences with the opportunity to be the first cinemagoers in the world to see the hugely-anticipated 24th film in the James Bond franchise, one of the longest-running and most successful movie\u00a0franchises in cinema history.  Following the World Premiere and the release of SPECTRE in the UK and Ireland, the new 007 adventure will then begin its rollout in territories across the rest of the globe. The movie will be released in the USA on November 6th, 2015.  The official confirmation of the premiere and general release dates will be welcomed by Bond fans, as there had been some mixed messages about the precise arrangements in earlier marketing material. The clarification will now enable 007 aficionados to plan ahead. Its become something of a tradition for some Bond fans from around the globe to head for London each time a new James Bond movie is premiered.  The venue for the premiere of SPECTRE is expected to be announced fairly soon. The previous James Bond adventure, Skyfall, was premiered in London at the Royal Albert\u00a0Hall, and went on to set a new all-time box office record in the UK. It also went on to earn over $1.1. billion worldwide.  Did You Know?  The very first James Bond film, Dr. No, opened on October 5th, 1962, at the London Pavilion cinema in Piccadilly Circus. The second Bond adventure, From Russia With Love, opened on October 10th, 1963, at the same location. The third movie in the franchise, Goldfinger, opened on September 17th, 1964, at the new location of the Odeon, Leicester Square. By this point, Bond was beginning to see enormous crowds gather for the premiere. Interestingly, for Thunderball, which in many ways saw Bond fever reach new heights, the UK hosted dual premieres in London on December 29th, 1965: at the Rialto Theatre and the Pavilion Theatre.

This was the only instance in the        20th century that this award was given to an African-American.  1963  Cleopatra (1963), the most expensive film        ever made (in terms of real costs adjusted for inflation) to date opened. It was one of        the biggest flops in film history (cost-overruns made the $2 million budget become $44 million). The epic starred        Elizabeth Taylor, Rex Harrison, and Richard Burton. Negative publicity was        generated by the off-screen extra-marital affair conducted between major        stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (as Marc Antony) (married to        Eddie Fisher and Sybil Burton respectively) - in the long run, it was beneficial        for the film's bottom line, since it became the most expensive film made-to-date, and took two and a half years of filming.        The stars' off-screen indiscretions helped (although they were criticized        on moral grounds), but it took many years for the film to recoup its enormous        costs.  1963  Elizabeth Taylor was the first female star (or       actress) to sign and be paid a record $1 million for a film, for her       lead role in the legendary epic film Cleopatra (1963) from       20th Century Fox.", "truth": ["from russia with love"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1099", "mistake": "The James Bond International Fan Club", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

He was the son of an upper-class burgeois family and attended the best schools, becoming a lawyer in 1651. After being a lawyer for some time, he was appointed chief clerk in the king's building, superintendent's office in 1664. While there, he induced Colbert to establish a fund called Liste des Bienfaits du Roi, to give pensions to writers and savants not only in France but in Europe. He took part in the creation of the Academy of Sciences as well as the restoration of the Academy of Painting. When the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres was founded by Colbert in 1663, Perrault was made secretary for life. Having written but a few popular poems, he was elected to the French Academy in 1671, and on the day of his inauguration he invited the public to be admitted to the meeting, a privilege that has ever since been continued. Perrault laid the foundations for a new literary genre, the fairy tale, with his works derived from pre-existing folk tales. The best known of his tales include Le Petit Chaperon rouge (Little Red Riding Hood), Cendrillon (Cinderella), Le Chat Bott\ufffd (Puss in Boots), La Belle au bois dormant (The Sleeping Beauty) and La Barbe bleue (Bluebeard). His stories continue to be printed and have been adapted to opera, ballet (for example, Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty), theatre, and film. He also wrote Parall\ufffdles des Anciens et des Modernes (the Parallels between the Ancients and the Moderns), from 1688 to 1697, which compared the authors of antiquity unfavorably to more modern writers, and caused a debate that lasted for years. Charles Perrault died on May 16, 1703.  Although now best known for his stained glass work, Harry Clarke (1889-1931) first found fame as a book illustrator. His edition of The Fairy Tales of Hans Christian Andersen was followed by illustrated editions of Edgar Allan Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination, The Years at the Spring, Charles Perrault's Fairy Tales of Perrault, and Goethe's Faust.

Let\u2019s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride \u2013 Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary\u2019s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James\u2019s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father\u2019s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII\u2019s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II\u2019s son, Fran\u00e7ois, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de\u2019 Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin Fran\u00e7ois at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that Fran\u00e7ois and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5\u2032 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary\u2019s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary\u2019s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary\u2019s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O\u2019Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567.

He takes Buzz's life savings, practices shooting with Buzz's BB gun, jumps on the bed, watches a gangster film, and eats a large amount of junk food. However, he finds himself scared by the appearance of the Chicago Police Department called by his parents to check on him, his next door neighbor \"Old Man\" Marley, who was rumored to have murdered his family many years earlier, and the appearance of the Wet Bandits, Harry Lyme and Marv Merchants, who are breaking into other vacant houses on the block.  On Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears Harry and Marv discussing plans for breaking into his house that night. After conversing with a Santa Claus impersonator and watching a local choir perform in a church, he comes across Marley. The two of them talk, and he learns that Marley is in fact a very nice man and the rumors about him are not true. He tells Kevin he is watching the choir because his granddaughter is in it, and he never gets to see her because he and his son have not spoken in years after a big argument they had. Kevin advises him to reconcile with his son.  His own spirits lifted by encouraging Marley, Kevin heads home and sets up various booby traps inside the house. Harry and Marv break in. After the two spring every trap in the house, Kevin flees to the second floor of the house and dials 911. They chase him out of the house, and he flees to the vacant neighboring home. The Wet Bandits catch him when he runs to the top of the stairs and hang him on a coat hook on the door. Marley sneaks up behind them and knocks them out with a snow shovel before taking Kevin home. Shortly after, Harry and Marv are arrested.  Kevin wakes up the next morning and is disappointed to see that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house, calling for him. He goes downstairs, and the two of them meet and reconcile. Immediately after, the rest of the McCallisters, having traveled directly from Paris to Chicago, arrive. Kevin and Buzz have a moment of reconciliation. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's missing gold tooth and wonders what it is. Kevin then goes over to the window and sees Marley greeting his son and his family. While Marley is hugging his granddaughter, he looks up to see Kevin, and waves to him (as a sign of thanking him). Kevin waves back, grinning also, and watches as Marley heads inside with his family. However, Buzz interrupts Kevin's musings by calling out, \"Kevin! What did you do to my room?\"  Kevin immediately runs off probably to Buzz's room or somewhere in the house, and the film ends.  Spoilers end here.

{"input": "Question: What country has the largest amount of rainforest? </s> Context: Rainforests: facts, figures, news, and picturesRainforests: facts, figures, news, and pictures  Tropical forests presently cover about 2.4 billion hectares or about 16 percent of Earth's land surface.  The world's largest rainforest is the Amazon rainforest  Brazil has the largest extent of rainforest cover  Rainforests also exist outside the tropics, including temperate North America, South America, Australia, and Russia.  An estimated 50 percent of terrestrial biodiversity is found in rainforests  Rainforests are thought to store at least 250 billion tons of carbon  Deforestation and degradation of tropical forests account for roughly 10 percent of global greenhouse emissions from human activities  Rainforests are forest ecosystems characterized by high levels of rainfall, an enclosed canopy and high species diversity. While tropical rainforests are the best-known type of rainforest and the focus of this section of the web site, rainforests are actually found widely around the world, including temperate regions in Canada, the United States, and the former Soviet Union.  Tropical rainforests typically occur in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, latitudes that have warm temperatures and relatively constant year-round sunlight. Tropical rainforests merge into other types of forest depending on the altitude, latitude, and various soil, flooding, and climate conditions. These forest types form a mosaic of vegetation types which contribute to the incredible diversity of the tropics.  The bulk of the world's tropical rainforest occurs in the Amazon Basin in South America. The Congo Basin and Southeast Asia, respectively, have the second and third largest areas of tropical rainforest. Rainforests also exist on some the Caribbean islands, in Central America, in India, on scattered islands in the South Pacific, in Madagascar, in West and East Africa outside the Congo Basin, in Central America and Mexico, and in parts of South America outside the Amazon. Brazil has the largest extent of rainforest of any country on Earth.  Global forest cover  Data from Saatchi et al 2011 .  Rainforests provide important ecological services, including storing hundreds of billions of tons of carbon, buffering against flood and drought, stabilizing soils, influencing rainfall patterns, and providing a home to wildlife and indigenous people. Rainforests are also the source of many useful products upon which local communities depend.  While rainforests are critically important to humanity, they are rapidly being destroyed by human activities. The biggest cause of deforestation is conversion of forest land for agriculture. In the past subsistence agriculture was the primary driver of rainforest conversion, but today industrial agriculture \u2014 especially monoculture and livestock production \u2014 is the dominant driver of rainforest loss worldwide. Logging is the biggest cause of forest degradation and usually proceeds deforestation for agriculture.

Location: rainforests lie in the tropics.  Rainfall: rainforests receive at least 80 inches (200 cm) of rain per year.  Canopy: rainforests have a canopy, which is the layer of branches and leaves formed by closely spaced rainforest trees some 30 meters (100 feet) off the ground. A large proportion of the plants and animals in the rainforest live in the canopy.  Biodiversity: rainforests have extraordinarily highs level of biological diversity or \u201cbiodiversity\u201d.

Twenty years ago this week, on September 19th, 1992, Filbert Fox made his first appearance ever as the Club\u2019s new mascot. He was introduced to the Filbert Street crowd in the Division One (now Championship) game against Brentford, when he appeared on the pitch with \u2018The Birch\u2019 and Gary Lineker who were presenting a cheque for \u00a35000 to the winner of the Club\u2019s lottery.  Filbert was one of the first modern football mascots. He followed a tradition of earlier Leicester mascots which variously included small boys in schoolcaps with labels hung around their neck naming a favourite player, wooden cut-out figures held aloft on a pole and an elderly gentleman who wore a long coat and a blue and white top hat and who carried a blue and white walking stick( both of which can still be seen in the Reception Area of the Stadium).\u00a0  The Matchday Programme for the Brentford game featured the new mascot as its leading story. The first published words ever written about Filbert were, \u201cHere\u2019s the newest addition to the Filbert Street family. The new Leicester City Fox. And in \u2018City Magazine\u2019 we\u2019re running a great competition to find a new name for our fox. All you have to do is come up with a winning name and you\u2019ll win a Leicester City playing kit of your choice\u201d. \u00a0In those pre-internet days, entries had to be dropped into the \u2018special fox box\u2019 in the Club Shop at Filbert Street.  The winning entry was announced in the programme for the game against Barnsley a couple of weeks later. Under the headline, \u2018It\u2019s Filbert the Fox\u2019, it was announced that, \u2018Our new Leicester City mascot has been christened Filbert the Fox..by popular demand.We received an overwhelming response to name the new Fox, and hundreds of you plumped for Filbert.We put all the entries for Filbert into a draw and the lucky winner was Mr T. Pearce\u2019.  A wide range of names had been suggested. These included Septimus \u00a0(after the famous pre-war Leicester City player Sep Smith), Englebert, Felix, Fearless Fred, and Bluey \u00a0the Brush. Two entries paid tribute to manager Brian Little who had guided Leicester City to the Wembley Play-Off final for a place in the Premier League four months earlier, and was to repeat the feat for the following two seasons. These were, bizarrely, B.L.U.E (Brian Little\u2019s Ultimate Exponent) and Brilliantte (an anagram of Brian Little).\u00a0  Filbert spent his first season resplendent in the Club\u2019s new all-blue strip with the new Fox-head logo on a white cinquefoil . This had replaced the Running Fox crest, was introduced in Filbert\u2019s first season and was the basis of the present day crest.  Over the next twenty years Filbert has been a constant presence on matchdays, cheering on the team from the sidelines and entertaining the crowd with his antics. He has never missed a home match. He has outlasted fourteen managers and hundreds of players. \u00a0He has also made numerous visits to schools and to a whole variety of organisations around the City and County.\u00a0  He has met a host of celebrities including Kasabian, John Barnes, Gary Lineker, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Ricky Hatton, two-time Olympic gold medallist rower Andrew Triggs-Hodge, Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini, Englebert Humperdinck, David Neilson (aka Coronation Street\u2019s \u00a0Roy Cropper) Rendall Munroe and Mark Selby.  On three occasions he won the Leicester Mercury \u2018Mascot of the Year\u2019 Award.\u00a0  One of Filbert\u2019s greatest honours was to help deliver the City of Leicester\u2019s bid for the 2018 English FIFA World Cup bid at Wembley.", "truth": ["leicester city", "filbert fox", "leicester city fc"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1308", "mistake": "Leicester City F.C.", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Question: In English what day of the week is the German dienstag? </s> Context: The Days of the Week in German language - Die WochentageLearn to say the Days of the Week (Die Wochentage) in German  By Hyde Flippo  Updated September 28, 2016.  The names for the seven days of the week originally came from the Babylonians (Babylonier) who named them for the sun, the moon and the five planetary gods. (Other cultures have had between five and ten days in a week.)  Most of the western Romance languages adopted these terms via Greek and Latin. But the Germanic languages (German and English among them) took on the Teutonic forms. For instance, the Babylonian Marduk, the god of war, was Ares in Greek and Mars in Latin. To the Germanic tribes the god of war was Ziu. So Latin\u00a0dies marti\u00a0(Tuesday, \"Mars Day\") became \"mardi\" in French, \"martes\" in Spanish, but\u00a0ziostag\u00a0in Old High German, or\u00a0Dienstag\u00a0in modern German. English adipted Saturn-Day (Saturday), but German used Germanic forms for the days.  Below are the seven days of the week in their Latin, Germanic and English forms. By the way, the European week begins on Monday, not Sunday, as in North America. (Also see our\u00a0 Date and Time Glossary , which includes the calendar.)  Tage der Woche  German for Beginners: Calendar, Days, Dates - Lesson 12Learn About Months, Dates, Seasons, and Days in German  By Hyde Flippo  Updated August 01, 2016.  After studying this lesson, you'll be able to: (1) say the days and months in German, (2) express calendar dates, (3) talk about the seasons and (4) talk about dates and deadlines (Termine) in German.  Luckily, because they are based on Latin, the English and German words for the months are almost identical. The days in many cases are also similar because of a common Germanic heritage. Most of the days bear the names of Teutonic gods in both languages. For example, the Germanic god of war and thunder, Thor, lends his name to both English\u00a0Thursday\u00a0and German\u00a0Donnerstag\u00a0(thunder =\u00a0Donner).  The German Days of the Week (Tage der Woche)  Let's start with the days of the week (Tage der Woche). Most of the days in German end in the word (der)\u00a0Tag, just as the English days end in \"day.\" The German week (and calendar) starts with Monday (Montag) rather than Sunday. Each day is shown with its common two-letter abbreviation.  Tage der Woche  \"sun day\"  \u00a0  The seven days of the week are masculine\u00a0(der) since they usually end in -tag (der Tag). The two exceptions, Mittwoch and Sonnabend, are also masculine. Note that there are two words for Saturday. Samstag is used in most of Germany, in Austria, and in German Switzerland. Sonnabend (\"Sunday eve\") is used in eastern Germany and roughly north of the city of M\u00fcnster in northern Germany. So, in Hamburg, Rostock, Leipzig or Berlin, it's Sonnabend; in Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich or Vienna \"Saturday\" is Samstag. Both words for \"Saturday\" are understood all over the German-speaking world, but you should try to use the one most common in the region you're in. Note the two-letter abbreviation for each of the days (Mo, Di, Mi, etc.). These are used on calendars, schedules and German/Swiss watches that indicate the day and date.  Using Prepositional Phrases With Days of the Week  To say \"on Monday\" or \"on Friday\" you use the prepositional phrase\u00a0am Montag\u00a0or\u00a0am Freitag. (The word\u00a0am\u00a0is actually a contraction of\u00a0an\u00a0and\u00a0dem, the dative form of\u00a0der. More about that below.)

Paul Hayes Tucker is the leading expert on Monet in the USA. This book locates the series paintings within the context of their time. Tucker looks at the development of his art before the 1890s and the cultural pressures of the 1880s that caused Monet to turn to serial painting.  He focuses on the major and minor series of paintings from the 1890s - including the paintings of Rouen Cathedral - and examines how they were painted and how they were received.  \u201cTo me the motif itself is an insignificant factor. What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me.\"  \u2014 Claude Monet  About Rouen Cathedral  Rouen Cathedral is a Gothic cathedral in Rouen, in northwestern France.  It's the seat of the Archbishop of Rouen and the building of Notre dame Cathedral started in 1200 and contains nearly the entire history of the Gothic style over a period of some 400 years. In the middle ages it's also where the kings of France were crowned.  Rouen is also situated some 60 kilometres from Giverny and is a city which Monet - and the French - knew well.  When looked at from the perspective of his paintings prior to 1892, the important thing to note is that he had never before before focused on one building or architectural element or even painted one motif as often as he did with Rouen Cathedral and its facades.  It's maybe important to note that Turner - the other great painter of atmosphere and light - had also created an engraving of Rouen Cathedral as part of his series on River Scenery in France.  The novelty of working with one motif meant that it became imbued with meaning. Hayes Tucker points to the religious revival in France in the 1890s and the fact that a Gothic Cathedral was a distinctly French symbol.

With his distinctive Mid-Atlantic accent, he was noted as perhaps the foremost exemplar of the debonair leading man, handsome, virile, charismatic and charming. He was named the second Greatest Male Star of All Time of American cinema, after Humphrey Bogart, by the American Film Institute. He was well known for starring in classic films such as The Philadelphia Story, North by Northwest, Notorious, His Girl Friday, To Catch A Thief, Bringing Up Baby and The Bishop's Wife.  Early life and career  Archibald Alec Leach was born in Horfield, Bristol, England in 1904 to Elsie Maria Kingdom and Elias Leach. An only child, he had a confused and unhappy childhood, attending Bishop Road Primary School. His father placed his mother in a mental institution when he was nine and his mother never overcame her depression after the death of a previous child. His father had told him that she had gone away on a \"long holiday\" and it was not until he was in his thirties that Leach discovered her still alive, living in an institutionalized care facility.  He was expelled from the Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol in 1918. He subsequently joined the \"Bob Pender stage troupe\" and travelled with the group to the United States as a stilt walker in 1920, on a two-year tour of the country. When the troupe returned to England, he decided to stay in the US and continue his stage career.  Still under his birth name, he performed on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri, in such shows as Irene (1931); Music in May (1931); Nina Rosa (1931); Rio Rita (1931); Street Singer (1931); The Three Musketeers (1931); and Wonderful Night (1931).  Hollywood stardom  After some success in light Broadway comedies, he went to Hollywood in 1931, where he acquired the name Cary Lockwood. He chose the name Lockwood after the surname of his character in a  recent play called Nikki. He signed with Paramount Pictures, but while studio bosses were impressed with him, they were less than impressed with his adopted stage name. They decided that the name Cary was OK, but Lockwood had to go due to a similarity with another actor's name. It was after browsing through a list of the studio's preferred surnames, that Cary Grant was born. Grant chose the name because the initials C and G had already proved lucky for Clark Gable and Gary Cooper, two of Hollywood's then-biggest movie stars.

The father of basketball was a high school dropout who eventually earned four college degrees. Dr. James A. Naismith was a modest man who neither sought publicity nor engaged in self-promotion. He was a remarkably versatile and humble man who in 1891 invented a game that is now played by more people than any game in the world.  It\u2019s doubtful that even Naismith\u2019s creative mind could have envisioned his game\u2019s vast global popularity little more than a century later, or a National Basketball Association consisting of 30 teams spanning North America. All he was seeking was an indoor activity that would provide an outlet for sometimes-unruly students during the long, cold New England winters.  In late 1891, Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick Jr., the superintendent of physical education at the International YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Mass., challenged Naismith to create a new indoor game \u201cthat would be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play in the winter and by artificial light.\u201d Naismith reflected on popular games of the day (baseball, football, lacrosse, rugby and soccer) and the games from his childhood (duck on a rock), and assembled the pieces that would become Basket Ball. It would be 30 years before it would be shortened to one word.  Naismith had the school janitor, Pop Stebbins, nail two peach baskets to the lower rail of the gymnasium balcony, one at each end, while the secretary, Mrs. Lyons, typed the original 13 rules.

On December 21, 1891 the students played the entire class period and finished the game with a 1-0 score. Within a few weeks, basketball quickly spread on campus by word of mouth and across the United States through the YMCA network.  Hoopedia: Herkimer YMCA  Herkimer YMCA, from Herkimer, New York, was an early pioneer in basketball and a catalyst for the development of basketball in the state. The team is of interest in terms of historiography based on a claim in a memoirs of an old time basketball player that it was at Herkimer where basketball was invented and where the first formal game was played.  The Herkimer YMCA basketball team was reputedly founded by Lambert Will in the fall of 1891, according to a Utica Daily Press story from February 19, 1998. The team\u2019s earliest photo supposedly dates from the 1891-92 season, and the story of the Herkimer team was presented by Frank J. Basloe in his 1952 book, I Grew Up with Basketball. In the book he makes the claim that basketball was invented at the Herkimer YMCA and the first formal game was played in February of 1891 between Herkimer YMCA and the Businessmen\u2019s Nine. The author claims that Will \u201cwrote down all the rules that he and boys had developed and sent them to James Naismith at Springfield.\u201d These claims have never been accepted by any historian of basketball.  Basloe is on no firmer ground in reporting that during the 1891-92 season other upstate New York teams took up the sport, notably Albany YMCA, Utica YMCA, and Ilion YMCA. In February 1892, Herkimer YMCA played Albany YMCA for the self-designated, \u201cBasketball Championship of New York State.\u201d Playing for the Herkimer team were", "truth": ["basketball team", "basketball player", "basketball", "basket ball"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7500", "mistake": "The Big Apple: Basketball", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.5}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

Its greatest breadth, on the mainland, is about 28 miles (45 km), and its total length, from the Kvarner (Quarnero) gulf to the narrows of Kotor (Cattaro), is about 233 miles (375 km). The major islands from north to south (with Italian names in parentheses) are Krk (Veglia), Cres (Cherso), Rab (Arba), Pag (Pago), Dugi Otok (Isola Lunga), Bra\u010d (Brazza), Hvar (Lesina), Vis (Lissa), Kor\u010dula (Curzola), Mljet (Meleda), and Lastovo (Lagosta). A rugged and barren range of mountains, the Dinaric Alps, divides Dalmatia from the interior. With peaks ranging from 1,500 feet (450 m) to more than 6,200 feet (1,900 m), the Dinaric Alps offer only two main passes: the Krka River canyon and the Neretva River valley. The Dalmatian coastline has numerous bays and harbours and is noted for its scenic beauty. The climate is mild, with dry summers, abundant rain in autumn and winter, and very little snow.  The coast of Dalmatia near Omis, Croatia.  Markus Bernet  Kor\u010dula city, Kor\u010dula island, Croatia.  \u00a9 swisshippo/Fotolia  The first recorded inhabitants of Dalmatia were Illyrians (the name Dalmatia probably comes from the name of an Illyrian tribe, the Delmata, an Indo-European people who overran the northwestern part of the Balkan Peninsula beginning about 1000 bce). The Greeks began to settle there from the 4th century, founding a number of colonies on the islands, the most famous of which were Issa (Vis), Pharos (Hvar), and Corcyra Melaina (Kor\u010dula), and a few towns on the mainland coast, one of which is Salona (Solin), near modern Split. The Greeks, opposed by the Illyrians, appealed to the Romans for help, and a long series of Roman-Illyrian wars began in 229. The fall of the Dalmatian capital, Delminium, in 155 brought Roman civilization to the country. On the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Dalmatia fell under the power of Odoacer in 481 ce and later under that of Theodoric, to become a battlefield during the wars between the Goths and the Byzantine emperor Justinian I .  Split, Croatia.  Palestine  By the time permanent Venetian rule had been established (1420), Dalmatia had passed through about 30 changes of sovereignty . Byzantines , Greeks, Magyars, Tatars, Croatian and Serbian princes, Venetians, Sicilians, and Normans were among its conquerors. The Croatian kings and the Venetian doges were the only rulers who held power long enough to leave a permanent mark on Dalmatian character and consciousness .  Venetian rule , established in 1420 when the king of Croatia, Ladislas of Naples, ceded the country to the Venetian republic, ended in 1797. This period was marked by Venetian warfare against the Turks. When the French gave Venice to Austria under the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797), Dalmatia became Austrian also; but in 1805, under the Treaty of Pressburg , Austria had to cede Dalmatia to Napoleon. It was returned to Austria after Napoleon\u2019s fall and remained an Austrian crownland until 1918.  During World War I , by the secret Treaty of London (1915), the Allies had promised large territories, including northern Dalmatia, to the Italians in return for their support. This treaty embittered negotiations for a peace settlement. Finally, the Treaty of Rapallo (November 12, 1920) between Italy and Yugoslavia gave all Dalmatia to the Yugoslavs except the mainland Zadar (Italian: Zara) enclave and the coastal islands of Cres, Lo\u0161inj (Lussino), and Lastovo.

Her devotion to Edward helped bring out his better qualities; after her death, his rule became somewhat arbitrary.

Eleanor of Castile, detail of an electrotype from an effigy in Westminster Abbey; in the National \u2026  Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery, London  In 1254 Eleanor was married to Lord Edward, son of England\u2019s King Henry III . In honour of the event, her half brother, Alfonso X of Castile, transferred to Edward his claims to Gascony. When Henry III\u2019s baronial opponents seized power in England in 1264, Eleanor was sent for safety to France; she returned in October 1265, after Edward had crushed the rebels.  Eleanor accompanied Edward on a crusade from 1270 to 1273. The story that she saved his life at Acre (now in Israel) by sucking poison from a dagger wound is evidently apocryphal . After Edward ascended the throne, Eleanor was criticized for allegedly mistreating the tenants on her lands.

He was born in Westminster on June 17, 1239, the eldest son of King Henry III, and at 15 married Eleanor of Castile. In the struggles of the barons against the crown for constitutional and ecclesiastical reforms, Edward took a vacillating course. When warfare broke out between the crown and the nobility, Edward fought on the side of the king, winning the decisive battle of Evesham in 1265. Five years later he left England to join the Seventh Crusade. Following his father's death in 1272, and while he was still abroad, Edward was recognized as king by the English barons; in 1273, on his return to England, he was crowned. The first years of Edward's reign were a period of the consolidation of his power. He suppressed corruption in the administration of justice, restricted the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to church affairs, and eliminated the papacy's overlordship over England. On the refusal of Llewelyn ab Gruffydd (died 1282), ruler of Wales, to submit to the English crown, Edward began the military conflict that resulted, in 1284, in the annexation of Llewelyn's principality to the English crown. In 1290 Edward expelled all Jews from England. War between England and France broke out in 1293 as a result of the efforts of France to curb Edward's power in Gascony. Edward lost Gascony in 1293 and did not again come into possession of the duchy until 1303. About the same year in which he lost Gascony, the Welsh rose in rebellion. Greater than either of these problems was the disaffection of the people of Scotland. In agreeing to arbitrate among the claimants to the Scottish throne, Edward, in 1291, had exacted as a prior condition the recognition by all concerned of his overlordship of Scotland. The Scots later repudiated him and made an alliance with France against England. To meet the critical situations in Wales and Scotland, Edward summoned a parliament, called the Model Parliament by historians because it was a representative body and in that respect was the forerunner of all future parliaments. Assured by Parliament of support at home, Edward took the field and suppressed the Welsh insurrection.

The ship, registered in Liberia, was carrying 128,000 tons of crude oil for Texaco.  The Sea Empress slammed into some underwater rocks and ran aground.

Thanks  Captain Birdseye  \"Captain Birds Eye actor dies, 86  Actor John Hewer, who was best known for playing Captain Birds Eye in the popular fish finger adverts, has died aged 86.  He played the role of the jovial naval captain, who was aimed at children, from 1967 until 1998.  The star, who was a resident of actors' retirement home Brinsworth House in Middlesex, passed away on Sunday.  He also appeared in the original Broadway production of Sandy Wilson's The Boy Friend. The Captain Birds Eye character has outlasted the likes of the Milky Bar Kid and McDonalds' Ronald McDonald. In 1971 an obituary for the Birds Eye character appeared in the Times newspaper after it was decided to retire him.  However, that was only temporary and he returned to TV screens three years later.  When he eventually did retire from the role, actor Thomas Pescod took over.

He was indeed .... he played the unfortunate taxi driver.  Actor best known for his advertising role as Captain Birdseye  by Simon Farquhar  The Guardian,  Thursday March 20 2008  The actor John Hewer, who has died aged 86, embodied Captain Birdseye, the face of fish fingers, in a series of television commercials from 1967 to 1998. He outlived brand-personalities such as the Milky Bar Kid and the Honey Monster, and came 65th in the Channel 4 poll of the 100 greatest TV adverts in 2000. Seventeen years earlier he had done rather better when he was voted \"the second most recognised captain in the world\", having been pipped to the post by Captain Cook.  Hewer was born in Leyton, east London, and for most of his life was a resident of Epping. His acting career began in the late 1940s, and for 20 years he appeared in many low-key British movies, especially thrillers such as The Dark Man (1951) and Strip Tease Murder (1961).  He was a particular favourite of producers Harry Lee and Eddie Danziger, in films such as Operation Stogie (?)  (1959), alongside Anton Rodgers and Susan Stephen, and the Danziger brothers frequently called on him to appear in small roles. They were renowned for economy and would travel around the major studios buying up old, redundant sets from big budget movies at cheap prices, and then give budding young scriptwriters challenges such as \"we need a thriller with a small cast, but it's got to be set in a ballroom, a submarine and the Old Bailey\". With usually 14 days to write the script and a similarly gruelling production schedule, such fascinating limitations honed the crafts of many fine actors and writers.  Hewer's television work included Colonel March of Scotland Yard (1956) and Tales from Dickens (1959). He also played Edwin Cherryble in the 1977 BBC dramatisation of Nicholas Nickleby, with Nigel Havers in the title role.  His most high-profile television role - after Captain Birdseye, with his observation to a group of happy children, \"only the best for the captain's table\" - came when he hosted the Pig and Whistle, Canada's longest running prime-time musical variety show, in the late 1960s.

I encourage everyone to comment and join in on an extended conversation about not only the films themselves, but cinematic trends, political and other external influences on the series\u2019 tone and direction.  Of [In]human #Bond_age_ #3: Subtext and the Rape of Pussy Galore  by James David Patrick  The following essay intends to discuss the cinematic subtext and potential cultural factors that may have influenced the creation of the \u201cbarn scene\u201d in Goldfinger. It is not meant to undermine the real horror that many women have had to overcome as a result of rape or sexual assault. I hope to treat the topic with sensitivity but still allow for a clinical but frank discussion about how or why the way we view this scene has changed in the nearly 50 years since its release.  James Bond confronts Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) in a barn. His aim, of course, is to have a figurative and literal roll in the hay. She is reluctant.\u00a0 She flips him. He flips her. It is aggressive yet supposedly playful courting, punctuated by a Mickey-Moused score (just in case you didn\u2019t grasp the supposed innocence of it all), the stubbornness of James Bond\u2019s womanizing and Pussy Galore\u2019s shield of chaste cynicism (a chastity we presume to be false), mano a femano. With both of them on the ground, he forces a kiss. She struggles beneath him before, inevitably, giving in and returning his embrace.  Taken outside of the context of the Bond oeuvre, particularly the 60\u2019s-era Connery films, the scene leaves the viewer discomforted. Red flags go up, sirens go off, many triggered by our modern sensitivities on the topic of rape and sexual assault.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a healthy number of years since I last wrote a paper concerning anything resembling feminism in cinema, but I\u2019ll do my best to avoid blundering over specific turns of phrase that might prove offensive. And since this is a blog format and not a thesis, pardon the shorthand that is required to keep this under 15,000 words.

History:  While attending Kings Park Secondary School in Glasgow, Bobby Gillespie met Robert 'Throb' Young and Alan McGee. Gillespie and McGee were heavily influenced by punk rock. In 1978, they joined a local punk band, The Drains , where Andrew Innes was the guitarist. After The Drains disbanded, McGee and Innes relocated to London, while Gillespie chose to remain in Glasgow.  In 1982, Bobby Gillespie and another school friend Jim Beattie recorded \"elemental noise tapes\", in which Gillespie would bang two dustbin lids together and Beattie played fuzz-guitar. They soon moved on to Velvet Underground and The Byrds cover songs before starting to write their own songs, based on Jah Wobble and Peter Hook basslines. They named themselves Primal Scream, a term used to describe a cry heard in primal therapy. Their first recording session, for McGee's independent label Essential Records, was a single track entitled \"The Orchard\". Beattie later claimed that they burned the master tape.  After the aborted recording, Gillespie joined The Jesus and Mary Chain as their drummer, and alternated between both bands. Soon Gillespie and Beattie expanded Primal Scream's lineup to include Robert Young on bass, rhythm guitarist Stuart May, drummer Tom McGurk, and tambourine player Martin St. John. This lineup was signed to Creation Records, an independent record label founded by Alan McGee, and recorded the group's debut single, \" All Fall Down \".  After the release of the single, Gillespie was told by The Jesus and the Mary Chain leaders William and Jim Reid that he was to either dissolve Primal Scream to join the Mary Chain full-time or resign and Gillespie chose to remain with Primal Scream. The B-side \" Velocity Girl \" of the single \" Crystal Crescent \", was released on the C86 compilation. The band switched to Alan McGee's Elevation Records.  After some lineup changes, Primal Scream's debut album Sonic Flower Groove was released in September 1987. The album reached number 62 on the British charts and received poor reviews. The backlash from the album caused internal strife within the band and another change in lineup.  The band's re-signed to Creation Records and released their first single in two years, \" Ivy, Ivy, Ivy \", followed in 4 September 1989 by their sophomore album, Primal Scream . The band's new indie rock sound was met with poor reviews. The album featured Felt keyboardist Martin Duffy guesting.  The band were first introduced to the acid house scene by McGee in 1988. The band met up with DJ Andrew Weatherall at a rave, and he was given a copy of \" I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have \", a track from Primal Scream album, to remix for one of his shows. Weatherall added a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell & The New Bohemians 's \" What I Am \", a sample of Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson's \"Terraplane Blues\" and the central introductory sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie The Wild Angels. The resulting track, \" Loaded \", became the band's first major hit, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by another single, \" Come Together \", which reached number 19.  The band entered the studio with Weatherall, Hugo Nicholson, The Orb, and Jimmy Miller producing, and Martin Duffy now full time on keyboards. They released two more singles, \" Higher Than the Sun \" and \" Don't Fight It, Feel It \", both of which were successful. Their third album, Screamadelica , was released in the October 1991 to ecstatic reviews. The album was also a massive commercial success, reaching number 8 on the UK charts.

The 62-miles from Berrygrove, near Watford (now junction 5) to Crick, near Rugby (now junction 18) \u2013 opened by then Transport Minister Ernest Marples \u2013 linked north and south and is still part of the UK's longest motorway.  Paul Watters, head of road and transport policy at the AA, says: \"The significance of the M1 can't be underestimated \u2013 it is the backbone of the UK. It revolutionised travel as Britain's first long-distance motorway \u2013 before it opened, you'd be lucky to get to the Scottish border within eight hours from London but now you can be halfway up Scotland in that time.\"  The AA was instrumental in the development of the M1 \u2013 it was a founder member of the Roads Campaign Council, which put pressure on government to build new roads to reduce congestion and road accidents \u2013 and laid on a big AA presence at the opening ceremony near Slip End (now junction 10), just south of Luton.  Pictures from the AA archive on our flickr photostream \u00bb  Leading the way  The AA led the way in modernising roadside assistance, moving from the days of saluting patrols on motorcycle-sidecars to the widespread use of patrol vans with modern equipment. It formed a special motorway patrol force, equipped with Ford Escort estates and Land Rovers, and an AA spotter plane \u2013 a de Havilland Dragon Rapide piloted by a former WWII Mosquito pilot \u2013 monitored traffic flow and reported breakdowns and accidents, which were then radioed to patrols from a mobile office located at Broughton flyover, near Newport Pagnell (now junction 14).  Early days  The traffic in the early years was much quieter than now and, with no speed limit, overheating and blown engines were the most common call-outs. Retired AA motorway patrol Stan Hallard recollects watching AC Cobra cars being driven at more than 150mph.  However, Stan says that most cars of the day were simply not designed for sustained high speed driving: \"We would often go out to cars where the engine had literally blown up \u2013 people would naively drive flat-out in cars that often only had a basic one-litre engine with no temperature gauge. One trip on the motorway could be the death knell of a car.\"  Safety equipment was limited and the hard shoulder relatively narrow and soft, so stricken cars were often just towed off the motorway \u2013 sometimes in convoy with a stricken vehicle on tow at the rear and another at the front, pushed down the hard shoulder using special rubber bumpers.  The future of the M1  The engineers who designed the M1 estimated traffic of 20,000 cars per day but it now carries up to 140,000. Without upgrades, it is estimated that traffic on the M1 will flow at between 50mph and 60mph in peak periods by 2025 and will be stop-start on many sections.  The current solution is to improve capacity largely through limited widening, such as the recently completed scheme from junction 6A to 10. The AA says that by 2030, it is likely that most of the M1 will be 'widened' through 'active traffic management' using variable speed limits, traffic control and hard shoulder running.

Graveyard of St. Oswald's Church  \u00a0  In 1799 Wordsworth settled at Dove Cottage in Grasmere with his sister    Dorothy. In 1802 he married Mary Hutchinson with whom he had attended    infants' school. (Wordsworth had previously had an affair with Annette    Vallon, while he was in France, and by whom he had a daughter.)  Wordsworth had a deep love of nature that was inspired by his rural    childhood. (He had been born at Cockermouth on the coast of the Lake    District. ) In his long poem The Prelude - published in the year    of his death - Wordsworth dealt with many of his magical early    experiences.  In 1813 Wordsworth was appointed Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland.    Then, in 1843, after       the death of Robert Southey Wordsworth became Poet Laureate. \u00a0He originally refused the post\u00a0 due to his       advanced age but the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, assured him that no duties would be       expected.  In 1845 Robert Browning wrote The Lost Leader about Wordsworth - accusing him of abandoning his radical political    views in exchange for a 'handful of silver'.  Also buried in St. Oswald's churchyard are:-  Dorothy       Wordsworth ( his sister),       Mary Wordsworth (his wife),       Catherine, Thomas and Dora Wordsworth ( his children),       Sara Hutchinson (Mary's sister) and       Hartley Coleridge (son of S.T.

{"input": "Question: The board game Pachisi originated in which country? </s> Context: Pachisi & Ludo - The Online Guide to Traditional GamesPachisi & Ludo - Online guide  About  \u00a0  Pachisi          (also spelt Parcheesi, Pachisi, Parchisi, Parchesi; also known as Twenty-Five)          is the National Game of India. The name comes from the Indian word \"pacis\" which means twenty five, the highest score that could be thrown with the          cowry shells.\u00a0 Pachisi is, in fact, the younger sister of Chaupar (or Chausar or Chaupad, also known as Pat in Sanskrit), a more venerable,          complex and skilful game that is still played in India.  The Indian Emperor Akbar I of the 16th century Mogul Empire, apparently          played Chaupar on great courts constructed of inlaid marble. He would          sit on a Dias four feet high in the centre of the court and throw the          cowry shells. On the red and white squares around him, 16 beautiful women          from the harem, appropriately coloured, would move around according to          his directions. Remains of these boards can be seen today in Agra and          Allahabad.  The image of the board to the right is courtesy of Mihrab Antiques          and shows colourful cloth board with the distinctive beehive-shaped Chaupar          pieces.  There          is apparently a mention of Chaupar being played between two sets of princes          - cousin brothers of the Bharata family (Pandavas and Kauravas) in the          epic, Mahabharata. During this game the righteous Padavas lost the game          and their entire fortune to the devious Kauravas, which put his family          through a lot of hardship and suffering. This was ended by a great war          among them which led to destruction of the Kauravas. It is since that          time that the play of this intelligent game has dwindled due to a superstition          that it leads to pain and suffering... [Thanks to Mayuresh Kathe for this          note].  The board shown right is a modern interpretation sold by Masters Traditional          Games. On the left, a modern traditional material board from India by          kind permission of Raghu .  The          origins of Pachisi and Chaupar are lost in time but uncertain evidence          indicates that forms of the game were in existence in the Indian region          from at least the 4th century AD. Both have hardly changed since Emperor          Akbar played although the game is not as widely played in India as it          once was. Pachisi boards are typically constructed of cloth, 6 cowry shells          are thrown to determine the moves and the counters are made of wood in          a beehive shape.  Pachisi is a 'Cross and Circle' game, variations of which appear all          over the world e.g. Nyout from Korea which probably dates back at least          as far as 300AD, Pancha Keliya from Ceylon and the elaborate 'Edris A          Jin' from Syria. The Americas are supposed to have been colonised from          North East Asia and this evidence is supported by the fact that Cross          and Circle games have been found across North and South America. Mayan          games have been found from around 800 AD cut into ruins in Mexico and          when Europeans conquered the Aztecs in 1521 they discovered a game similar          to Pachisi being played by Montezuma's subjects. American Indians still          play Cross and Circle race games today.  \u00a0  Ludo & other Modern Western variants  In          1896, a westernised version of Pachisi was published in England under          the name Ludo (Latin for \"I play\"), a game which has been popular          in that country ever since. The game however, is a highly simplistic version          of Pachisi for children.\u00a0 The author has evidence that shows that          a game called \"Puchese\" was published at the much earlier date          of 11 April 1862 in England.  There is another less well-known descendent of Ludo called Uckers. The          OED's earliest reference to this game sums it up well: \"1946 J. Irving          Royal Navalese 180 Uckers. A game very similar to Ludo, and played on          a large board by teams of three or four men. \" In fact, Uckers is          a grown-up version of Ludo", "truth": ["india"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1248", "mistake": "India", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

It may have come from the Latin pix meaning \u201cpitch\u201d or Greek pitta, but others say that it originated in a Langobardic \u00a0word bizzo meaning \u201cbite.\u201d  Where did the dish itself emerge? The common belief is that Italians invented pizza, but a baked bread with toppings has many other precursors in other cuisines. Italy\u2019s version of the dish, especially from Naples, is the one we are most familiar with, though pissaladi\u00e8re from Provence, coca from Catalan, and lahma bi ajeen from the Middle East all bear a remarkable resemblance to pizza.  Supposedly, this archetypal pizza, an open-faced pie slathered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, was ushered in by the baker Raffaele Esposito in Naples. In 1889, he made a patriotic pie topped with mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes, ingredients the colors of the Italian flag, in honor of King Umberto and Queen Margherita\u2019s visit. It is rumored the Queen enjoyed the pie, and thus, it became known as a Margherita.  In the US, Italian immigrants sold pizza in their stores, and the first pizzeria was opened in 1905 by Gennaro Lombardi at 53 1/3 Spring Street in New York City, but pizza did not truly not catch on stateside until World War II.

The history of pizza has been, and is contentious, for we can never know which nation invented pizza, but pizza history is no less colorful for that fact. As we cannot know the date when the first pizza was invented ,we can only speculate who invented pizza.  Pizza, as we know it today, is a bread crust covered with a tomato base and then flavored with other toppings. Yet tomatoes did not appear on European menus until the Sixteenth Century, when they were brought over from the New World by the Spanish conquistadors. Pizza as we know it today, with a crust, tomato and other toppings, was even later in history; it did not originate until the eighteenth Century in Naples .  Italian folklore claims that the first pizza was Italian, and it is certain that in ancient times the ancient Greeks and Romans had a type of unleavened bread, topped with a flavor before being baked. We know from historical writings that the Greek pizza was merely vegetables, but the origin of the pizza in Italy was more sophisticated. It was topped with pork scraps, olives and the sweet desserts with honey, raisins and pine nuts. Some of those sweet dessert pizza recipes have been enshrined in pizza history and are still used in Italy today.  Italian pizza history  The precise history of the pizza and its origin will never be known, but here is what we know about the Italian pizza history:  The history of pizza goes back to the time of Virgil, who died in the first Century BC, but not before writing down a pizza recipe for posterity.

We will take you through the varied theories that are associated with the same.  Advertisement  Did You Know?  The earliest reference of the sword of Arthur comes from the mid-11th century Welsh prose tale Culhwch ac Olwen, which states the king's sword as Caledfwlch\u2015a Welsh word derived from Caladbolg meaning \"Hard Lightning\".  According to medieval British history, King Arthur was a king in the late 5th and early 6th century. Arthur is said to have led Britain against the Saxon invaders (somewhere in the early 6th century) and has become a legend over the centuries.  However, most of these stories are based on folklore and literary invention, and many historians debate and dispute his very existence.  Even though the very existence of King Arthur is shrouded in mystery, there are several stories about his life and many adventures that have become famous, and are popular even today.  Of these Arthurian legends (as they are popularly called), one of the most mysterious and popular is the legend of his Excalibur sword. In this Buzzle article, we will draw your attention to the theories that this famous sword is steeped in.  The Excalibur Sword  The Excalibur sword, also referred to as the Caliburn, was said to be made of gold and inlaid with gems. It is said that the sword was made on the Isle of Avalon. The Excalibur was extremely powerful, and legend has it that it could cut through the toughest of materials\u2015like wood and iron, alike. In describing its powers, therefore, it is also referred to as 'cut steel', which implies that it could even cut through steel.  The scabbard that the sword came in was also made of gold and lined with gems; it was believed to have mystical powers. It was said that it protected its owner from harm\u2015so much so, that whoever carried the scabbard could never be harmed. Legend says that when Merlin\u2015King Uther's counselor and Arthur's tutor\u2015asked Arthur what he would choose\u2015the sword or the scabbard, Arthur chose the sword, to which Merlin is said to have reprimanded him for making an unwise choice and asked him to care for the scabbard as well, because it would protect him on the battlefield\u2015such was the scabbard's powers.

{"input": "Question: What controversial phenomenon is measured by Zener cards? </s> Context: Zener ESP cards - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.comZener ESP cards - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com  \u00a0  \u00a0  Zener ESP cards were designed in the early 1930s by Karl Zener (1903-1963), an associate of J. B. Rhine , for use in ESP experiments ( Randi 1995 ).  There are five kinds of cards: one continuous curve        that makes a circle, two straight lines that cross in the middle at the perpendicular, three        wavy parallel vertical        lines, four straight lines that form a square, and a five-pointed star. Because of their distinctness,        there should be no ambiguity regarding any symbol. A deck of Zener cards consists of five of each symbol. The cards       would be shuffled and a receiver would then try to guess the cards that a        sender would try to telepathically communicate. Or a subject might try to guess which card from the deck        would be turned up next. Rhine recognized that this test couldn't        distinguish telepathy from clairvoyance . That        is, there would be no way to tell whether a receiver was receiving        messages from the mind of the sender or was receiving information        independently of the sender's mind. Of course, Rhine had no way of knowing        whether the information was coming from the guesser's own subconscious        mind, from the Pleiadians , the Akashic record , or even from Zeus or the        local baker's mind. But he was sure he had a way to rule out chance as an        explanation for any apparent information transfer in his experiments.  Since there are twenty-five cards in the deck and five kinds of cards,       there is a one in five or 20% chance that any given card is on       top of the deck or being viewed by a sender. Of course, these odds change        as soon as a card is removed from the deck. The odds for each selection        can remain identical only if each card is put back in the deck and the        cards are thoroughly reshuffled after each selection. From the point of        view of the guesser, however, as long as no feedback is given while going        through the deck with a sender, each card has a one in five chance of        being the card on top at any given time. A correct \"guess\" is called a \"hit\". Anything significantly       higher than 20% hits in the long run would indicate that something other than       chance is at work. In the short run, higher percentages are expected, on        occasion, by       chance. Thus, if a guesser got nine out of twenty-five correct (36%) going        through the deck once, that would not        necessarily be  indicative of anything important. If the guesser got 36% correct over 100        runs       through a deck of 25 cards (i.e., 2,500 guesses),       that would indicate that something       else besides chance is going on. Maybe you're psychic ,        maybe there is sensory leakage , or maybe you're cheating.\u00a0 (We know, for example, that some of the decks of Zener cards that were printed for        Rhine's lab were very thin and translucent, allowing receivers to see        through the card to identify which icon the        sender was looking at.)  Rhine would become ecstatic when anyone was found who could do        significantly better that 20% in guessing. Some were so phenomenal (e.g.,        Adam J. Linzmayer, George Zirkle, Sara Ownbey, and Hubert E. Pearce, Jr.)        that skeptics assume there must have been cheating. Rhine denied it. He        didn't think he could be deceived and thought his testing methods were        adequate. Nevertheless, charges of cheating plagued Rhine. Nobody thought Rhine was cheating but many thought he had been duped by his subjects        several times. According to Milbourne Christopher \u201cthere are at least a        dozen ways a subject who wished to cheat under the conditions Rhine        described could deceive the investigator\" (Christopher 1970: 24-25).

It had been in development, through talks and building the circuit itself, for several years, but the reception to the first Indian Grand Prix was muted.  The first sector of the Buddh circuit sees the home straight lead into a very tight and slow first corner, through several more turns, before heading onto a huge, long straight that leads to turn 4. After another straight, the corners become more frequent, with the sweeping right hander of turns 10 and 11 providing a real challenge. That area is also surrounded by grandstands, providing an excellent opportunity for fans to get some excellent views as the race unfolds.

Resorts at a variety of islands feature white-sand beaches, plenty of sunshine and balmy breezes. There's a resort to match a traveler's desires, whether they're looking for a quiet moment watching the sun dip below the horizon, hand in hand au naturel; or bending backwards on the dance floor during a stark-naked limbo contest. One thing about a clothing-optional vacation on the beach \u2013 it sure makes it easy to pack.  There's an important distinction to keep in mind if a traveler is considering vacationing at a clothing optional resort in the Caribbean: there's a difference between a naturist tourist and a lifestyle tourist. A naturist will be content to enjoy the sea and sand in the nude, while a lifestyle tourist will also be interested in sexual adventures, which might include swinging. Some resorts host special lifestyle weeks, which could end up being awkward if that's not what a traveler is looking for.  Here's a selection of top nude resorts in the Caribbean.  Club Orient, St. Martin  Club Orient, a resort on the French side of the island of St. Maarten , is on one of the most famous nude beaches in the Caribbean \u2013 which isn't always a good thing. A person doesn't have to be nude to gain access to Orient Beach, and the occasional tour group from a cruise ship is known to amble by, doing their best to get an eyeful.  There are a couple of things that make the 137-room Club Orient different from many other resorts in the Caribbean. First, it's not an all-inclusive resort, which means guests pay as they go (drinks, meals, activities, etc.) The other aspect that sets it apart is that it's a kid-friendly au naturel resort; multi-generational families can be seen taking a sun bath sans clothing. The hotel is also nude-friendly throughout the property, not just in restricted areas. Seeing a nude dude dishing up a plate of meatballs in the resort's main restaurant could take some getting used to.  Guests have a choice of booking rooms in one of the chalets or upgrading to a villa, which affords an extra measure of space and privacy. Club Orient also has a spa, lots of sports and water activities, as well as the option for enjoying a massage on the beach.  Hedonism II, Jamaica  Hedonism II in Jamaica is the big daddy of nude and naughty holidays in the Caribbean. While many au naturel resorts stress the health benefits of the naturist lifestyle, it's pretty clear where Hedonism II stands on the subject: run the sexual fantasy flag up the flagpole and see who salutes.  This adults-only all-inclusive resort in Negril has a loyal crowd that returns again and again for the kind of spicy holiday Hedonism II offers. This includes two private beaches (only one is nude); unisex saunas and steam rooms; three pools, including a nude pool; five bars; dancing at Club Hurricane; live entertainment (which leans towards the raunchy side) and theme nights, which vary from Reggae Nights to a Fetish Fantasy theme.  There are 280 rooms, and suites have sexy touches like mirrored ceilings and five-head Jacuzzi showers. Guests have the option of choosing rooms in either a nude section or a clothed wing. In addition to all the provocative fun, guests can indulge in all sorts of activities, including tennis, miniature golf, snorkeling, kayaking and water skiing; there's even a rock-climbing wall.  It's safe to say that Hedonism II is a lifestyle resort that is not for the easily embarrassed.  Caliente Caribe, Dominican Republic  Caliente Caribe is the only au naturel resort in the Dominican Republic .

{"input": "Question: Electric Christmas tree lights were first used in what year? </s> Context: History of Christmas Lights and Trees - About.com MoneyHistory of Christmas Lights and Trees  By Mary Bellis  Updated August 11, 2016.  The tradition of using small candles to light up the Christmas tree dates back to at least the middle of the XVIIth century. However, it took two centuries for the tradition to become widely established first in Germany and soon spreading to Eastern Europe.  Candles for the tree were glued with melted wax to a tree branch or attached by pins. Around 1890, candleholders were first used for Christmas candles. Between 1902 and 1914, small lanterns and glass balls to hold the candles started to be used.  Electricity  In 1882, the first Christmas tree was lit by the use of electricity. Edward Johnson lighted up a Christmas tree in New York City with eighty small electric light bulb. It should be noted that Edward Johnson created the first string of electric Christmas lights that were then mass produced around 1890. By 1900, department stores started using the new Christmas lights for their Christmas displays.  Edward Johnson was one of Thomas Edison's muckers, an inventor who worked under the direction of Edison.  continue reading below our video  How to Make a Monthly Budget That Works  Johnson became vice-president of Edison's electric company.  Safe Christmas Lights  Albert Sadacca was fifteen in 1917, when he first got the idea to make safety Christmas lights for Christmas trees. A tragic fire in New York City involving Christmas tree candles inspired Albert to invent electric Christmas lights. The Sadacca family sold ornamental novelty items including novelty lights. Albert adapted some of the products into safe electric lights for Christmas trees. The first year only one hundred strings of white lights sold. The second year Sadacca used brightly colored bulbs and a multi-million dollar business took-off. Later, a company started by Albert Sadacca (and his two brothers Henri and Leon) called NOMA Electric Company became the largest Christmas lighting company in the world.  \u00a0  Who invented electric Christmas lights? Everyday Mysteries ...Who invented electric Christmas lights? Everyday Mysteries: Fun Science Facts from  the Library of Congress  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who               invented electric Christmas lights?  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas             Edison and Edward Johnson (1880 &1882) and Albert Sadacca (1917).  Thomas Edison, the inventor of the first successful practical               light bulb, created the very first strand of electric lights. During               the Christmas season of 1880, these strands were strung around               the outside of his Menlo Park Laboratory. Railroad passengers traveling               by the laboratory got their first look at an electrical light display.               But it would take almost forty years for electric Christmas lights             to become the tradition that we all know and love.  Before electric Christmas lights, families would use candles to               light up their Christmas trees. This practice was often dangerous               and led to many home fires. Edward H. Johnson put the very first               string of electric Christmas tree lights together in 1882. Johnson,               Edison\u2019s friend and partner in the Edison\u2019s Illumination               Company, hand-wired 80 red, white and blue light bulbs and wound               them around his Christmas tree. Not only was the tree illuminated               with electricity, it also revolved.  However, the world was not quite ready for electrical illumination.               There was a great mistrust of electricity and it would take many               more years for society to decorate its Christmas trees and homes               with electric lights. Some credit President Grover Cleveland with               spurring the acceptance of indoor electric Christmas lights. In               1895, President                Cleveland requested that the White House family Christmas               tree be illuminated by hundreds of multi-colored electric light               bulbs.  On Christmas Eve 1923, President Calvin Coolidge began                 the country\u2019s celebration of Christmas by lighting the             National Christmas Tree with 3,000 electric lights on the Ellipse                 located south of the White House.  Until 1903, when General Electric began to offer pre-assembled               kits of Christmas lights, stringed lights were reserved for the               wealthy and electrically savvy. The wiring of electric lights was               very expensive and required the hiring of", "truth": ["1882"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3587", "mistake": "Thomas Edison", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

He earned the first D.V.M. degree awarded in the United States, and spent his career studying animal diseases for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He gave his name to the Salmonella genus of bacteria, which was discovered by an assistant, and named in his honor.  Biography  Early life and education  Salmon was born in Mount Olive Township, New Jersey.  Dr. Salmon's father, Daniel L. Salmon, died in 1851 and his mother, Eleanor Flock Salmon, died in 1859, leaving him an orphan at the age of 8.  He was then raised by his second cousin, Aaron Howell Salmon and spent time working both on Aaron's farm and as a clerk in a country store.  His early education was at the Mount Olive District School, Chester Institute, and Eastman Business College.  He then attended Cornell University and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine in 1872. After an additional four years of study, in veterinary health and science, he was awarded the professional degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Cornell in 1876, the first D.V.M. degree granted in the United States.[http://www.vet.cornell.edu/about/history.htm History and Archives of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine]  Toward the end of his career at Cornell, he studied at the Alfort Veterinary School in Paris, France.   Career  Dr. Salmon opened a veterinary practice in Newark, New Jersey in 1872 and subsequently moved to Asheville, North Carolina in 1875 due to his health.  In 1877 he gave a series of lectures at the University of Georgia on the topic of veterinary science. He worked for the State of New York, studying diseases in swine and for the United States Department of Agriculture studying animal diseases in the southern states. In 1883 he was asked to establish a veterinary division within the Department of Agriculture.  It became the Bureau of Animal Industry and he served as its chief from 1884 to December 1, 1905.  Under his leadership, the Bureau eradicated contagious pleural-pneumonia of cattle in the United States, studied and controlled Texas fever (Babesia), put in place the federal meat inspection program, began inspecting exported livestock and the ships carrying them, began inspecting and quarantining imported livestock, and studied the effect of animal diseases on public health.  In 1906 he established the veterinary department at the University of Montevideo, Uruguay and was its head for five years.  He returned to the United States in 1911 and concentrated on veterinary work in the western region of the country.  Salmonella is a genus of microorganisms named after him in Modern Latin in 1900 by J. Ligni\u00e8res, although the man who actually discovered and named the first strain, Salmonella cholerae suis, was Theobald Smith, Dr. Salmon's research assistant, who isolated the bacterium in 1885.  Since that time, more than 2,000 subtypes have been identified.  Death  He died of pneumonia August 30, 1914, in Butte, Montana and is buried in Washington, D.C.

{"input": "Question: What sort of game would you be playing if you played 'Spoil five'? </s> Context: Spoil Five : definition of Spoil Five and synonyms of ...Spoil Five : definition of Spoil Five and synonyms of Spoil Five (English)  7 External links  \u00a0 Object  Edmund Hoyle in his The Complete Gamester describes it as Five-cards. In the game of Five Cards, for example, when played by only two persons, Five and Ten, the card second in value is stated to be the ace of hearts, instead of the knave of trumps. [3]  Spoil Five is a respected member of one of the most prolific families of card games based on this pattern: each player receives five cards, or six or nine, and another is turned up to fix the trump suit. The object of the play is to win one trick, or at least three or five.  The game is played by 2\u20138 persons, five being the best number. When three play at this game, it is still necessary that one of them should win the three tricks in order to make a Five, as the stakes must remain for the next game if two of the players get two tricks each, and the other one. If the party consists of four, they play in two partnerships, which are determined by cutting the cards, the two lowest playing against the two highest, or by agreement among the parties. When six play, it is usual to play in three partnerships, and when eight play, in four. When five or six play it makes a very interesting game.  \u00a0 Preliminaries  A full pack of 52 cards is used and each player receives five cards, dealt in pairs and triplets, being the next card on the top of the pack turned up for trumps. Each player starts with a pre-arranged amount, which may be of 20 chips or counters, and puts up one chip upon the table to form a pool. The pool is usually limited to a certain maximum, which once reached there is no further subscription, though each dealer is required to \"tit-up\" the pool [4] .  The turn to deal and play always passes to the left, and after the first hand, each player deals in rotation. Where the game is strictly played, the person who misdeals, or who departs from the order with which the game began, of dealing either the three or the two cards first, forfeits his stake. Stack the rest face down, turning the topmost card for trumps.  \u00a0 Robbing  If the turn-up is an Ace, the dealer may \"rob\" the trump, i.e. put out, face downwards, any card from his hand and take in the Ace, but the trump suit remains unaltered. Similarly, a player who holds the Ace of trumps may himself rob the trump at any time before playing to the first trick, putting out any card and taking in the turn-up, but need not disclose the fact until it is his turn to play. If the holder of the trump Ace does not wish to rob, and does not announce the fact that he holds it before playing to the first trick, then, whenever he does play it, it counts as the lowest trump. A player who fails to rob cannot go out that hand. The card put out may not be seen. Robbing must take place before the first player on the dealer's left leads. Some players make \"robbing\" optional. [5]  \u00a0 The cards  Rank and order of cards in red suits when not trumps  * K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 A  Rank and order of cards in black suits when not trumps  * K Q J A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Rank and order of cards in red suits when trumps  * 5 J \u2665A A of trumps K Q 10 9 8 7 6 4 3 2  Rank and order of cards in black suits when trumps  * 5 J \u2665A A of trumps K Q 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 10  So it will be seen that when the suit is not trump", "truth": ["cards"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6611", "mistake": "Spoil Five", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

{"input": "Question: Ardbeg is whisky distillery on which Scottish island? </s> Context: Ardbeg Distilleries, Scotland | By Scotland ChannelArdbeg Distilleries, Scotland | By Scotland Channel  City finder  Ardbeg Distillery  Smugglers were distilling whisky here way back in 1794, though officially the Ardbeg Distillery was started in 1815. Located about four miles out of Port Ellen, Ardbeg distillery nestles in a rocky cove on the Island of Islay 's southern tip. The island lies off the west coast of Scotland.  This distillery flourished in the nineteenth century, the production rising from 500 gallons in 1835 to 250,000 gallons in 1886. The whisky produced here was an extremely smoky and briny Islay malt. The distillery was owned by the MacDougall family until 1977 after which there were several changes in ownership and functioning.  Unfortunately for the lovers of Ardbeg, who had acquired a taste for this distinctive whisky, the distillery worked only spasmodically between 1981 and 1997. In 1997, the well known Glenmorangie plc gallantly came to the rescue of Ardbeg. They dedicated their efforts to repairing and reviving the distillery and whitewashing it so it was once again a noticeable landmark on Islay\u2019s south coast.  Ardbeg gets its waters from a near by loch named Uigeadail and its peat from a hill that is two miles away. This peat is purely vegetable deposit, not highly decomposed and is devoid of sulfur or any other offensive mineral. The granaries which consist of five barley lofts, capable of storing nearly 3,000 quarters of grain are above the malting department which had four malting floors. Each possesses a brick and cement steep. The spacious kilns attached to the maltings, use only peat.  Ardbeg\u2019s main product is their Single Islay Malt Scotch Whisky, the most peaty malt whisky among the Islay malts. It is beautifully balanced, complex and deep. Ardbeg 1965 - The Envy of Islay is a rare Scotch with very few bottles available anywhere. Ardbeg Ten Years Old is the first non-chill filtered whisky in the Ardbeg range.  Very Young Ardbeg was first sold in 2003 as a 6 year old and was the first whisky produced since the reopening of the distillery in 1997. The distillery releases an older version every year till the new stocks are 10 years old. This gives die-hard Ardbeg lovers something to look forward to. A subsequent whisky of this range is Ardbeg Still Young, a zesty but creamier whisky that has rounded from extra aging.  Uigeadail is bottled at cask strength from a bourbon barrel and sherry butt which gives a sweet and smoky finish to this malt. Ardbeg Lord of the Isles is a 25 years old whisky embodies the richness, depth and sweetness of this special whisky.  A unique concept associated with Ardbeg is The Committee which was established in 1945. Anyone who enjoys the whisky can join this group, the general idea being to promote the advancement of general knowledge and enjoyment of Ardbeg. This group will ensure that with their support the distillery will never close again.

{"input": "Question: \"\"\"Cassata Siciliana\"\" is a type of what?\" ? </s> Context: Making Cassata alla Siciliana, in Sicily - David LebovitzMaking Cassata alla Siciliana, in Sicily - David Lebovitz  Making Cassata alla Siciliana, in Sicily  51 comments -  06.23.2014  I didn\u2019t want to cause a ruckus by sharing pictures of such a spectacular cake without a recipe. But on the other hand, it\u2019s quite a chore to make a Cassata alla Siciliana and although Fabrizia Lanza sailed through it without breaking a sweat, between using the right pan, mixing up your own almond paste, finding ricotta as good as the ricotta in Sicily, and getting the candied fruit (including the squash, which is the translucent white brick on the platter), it might be classified as one of those things that\u2019s better left to the Sicilians.  (Nevertheless, if you want to give it a go, Saveur printed her Cassata recipe, and it\u2019s also in her book, Coming Home to Sicily . I linked to additional recipes at the end of the post.)  According to Italian food specialist Clifford A. Wright , the word Cassata is derived from the Arabic word quas\u2019at, or qas\u2019at, which refers to a wide bowl. There is actually a special pan to make the cake; it\u2019s a mold with sloped sides and a groove around the bottom so that when Cassata mold is lined with strips of almond paste, and overturned, there\u2019s a rim to create a neat guard against the icing from running down the sides.  I found out what the pan was for when I was making some pine nut praline for an ice cream I was going to churn up for her, made by caramelizing 1 part sugar then stirring in 1 part lightly toasted pine nuts, which get spread on a flat, greased surface, and left to cool. In my haste to find a flat pan in an unfamiliar kitchen, I grabbed one Fabrizia\u2019s nice Cassata pans, as I was eyeing its flat, wide surface, perfect for spreading the praline.  I wasn\u2019t able to find where, globally, you can get one online . But I did find some dynamite metal popsicle molds during my search.  Speaking of kitchen tools, I was wowed by this amazing, single-purpose Italian tool. When I asked Fabrizia where she got it, she replied, \u201cIn America.\u201d  So somehow, people in the U.S. are able to roll the almond paste to fit snugly into the pan, but not actually find the right pan.  The first thing Fabrizia did was to make her own almond paste using finely ground almonds. Because I am a crunchy-granola California type, I asked if you could make the cake without the green food coloring.  Fabrizia laughed, but being Sicilian, she explained that Cassata is a cake for fun, festive occasions, and the vibrant green is part of the riot of colors that make the cake what it is meant to be. Although, perhaps bowing to overseas sensibilities, her mother, Anna Tasca Lanza said in one of her books that if you leave the green coloring out, you should pour the icing over the entire cake so that it hides the almond paste.  After cutting spongecake into strips to make a top layer for the cake, she whipped up a seriously good ricotta cream with the fresh sheeps\u2019 milk ricotta we\u2019d watched being made just the day before. Since she had a little extra, she tossed the bowl toward me with a spoon, and I dug right in.  Ladies and gentlemen, or signore e signori, no matter how far you are, if you are not booking a ticket to Sicily to taste sweetened sheeps\u2019 milk ricotta cream, may the rest of your life be filled with neutral-colored almond paste. (ie: No fun at all.)  Because she knows that I love bergamots as much as she does, she doused the spongecake with homemade bergamot syrup, which gave me the idea to return in the winter, when the bergamot and citron trees are bearing fruit, and do some serious candying and syrup-making with her. Although I felt kind of bad because when I tasted the bitter-citrus syrup,", "truth": ["cake"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3387", "mistake": "a special pan to make the cake; it\u2019s a mold with sloped sides and a groove around the bottom", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.13333333333333333}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

There had never been anything like it before.  It took James Bond from being a successful series of books to an unprecedented worldwide phenomenon, hitting its peak in the mid-1960s.  The actor may change. The style of each\u00c2\u00a0film reflects the time in which it was\u00c2\u00a0made. But more than 50 years later we still eagerly await each new instalment in the series. While not every Bond film is great, that is still a huge achievement.  And so below we take a look at every James Bond film produced by EON Productions.  If you\u2019re looking to buy the James Bond movies on DVD or Blu-Ray you can get some great deals on Amazon. Check out the Bond films at Amazon UK here or Amazon.com here .  Dr No (1962)  Screenplay  Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood & Berkely Mather  When in 1961 Albert R \u00e2\u0080\u009cCubby\u00e2\u0080\u009d Broccoli found that Harry Saltzman had a six-month option to film the James Bond novels he initially tried to buy him out. When Saltzman refused they teamed up to create Eon Productions and put 007 on the big screen.  Their first Bond film was originally going to be Thunderball, but when Kevin McClory sued Ian Fleming for plagiarism the producers decided to film Dr No instead. While it remains a fairly faithful adaptation the screenwriters added a number of scenes, such as Bond visiting Miss Taro, and the addition of Felix Leiter, who did not appear in the book.  Sean Connery makes a memorable opening at the casino and many of the elements we now associate with 007 were introduced in Dr No; the gunbarrel sequence, the James Bond Theme arranged by John Barry, the exotic locations, the car chase, the women and the vodka martinis.  However, it lacks the John Barry score and the music is, with the exception of the James Bond Theme and the use of Three Blind Mice, largely unmemorable.  From Russia With Love (1963)  Sean Connery  Screenplay  Richard Maibaum & Johanna Harwood  When Dr No proved to be a hit Eon Productions quickly followed it up with From Russia With Love, considered by Fleming to be his best work.  However, rather than the Cold War plot pitting the Russians and SMERSH against 007 the screenplay features SPECTRE play the Russians against MI6 in order to assassinate 007 and get hold of the Lektor code machine.  The second Bond film makes great use of the location work in Istanbul, as well as the scenes on board the Orient Express as Bond, Tania and Kerim flee with the Lektor. Bond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claustrophobic fight with Red Grant, highlighted by Peter Hunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groundbreaking editing, has rarely been equalled in the series.  Screenplay  Richard Maibaum & Paul Dehn  In many ways the quintessential James Bond movie, in introducing the gadget-packed Aston Martin DB5 Goldfinger simultaneously began to shift the series away from Ian Fleming\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision of James Bond and onto a trajectory of its own while turning the generations of boys that followed into avid collectors.  While broadly faithful to the novel, the film improves on the book substantially by making a small but important change to the villain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scheme. Rather than stealing the US gold reserves at Fort Knox, Auric Goldfinger plans on rendering them worthless by irradiating them, playing on the Cold War paranoia of the 1960s and the ever-present threat posed by nuclear weapons.  It also features one of the most memorable Bond girls in the shape of Pussy Galore and a pre-title sequence to which few of the films that followed have even come close in equalling. Whether or not Goldfinger is the best film in the series is a moot point. Without a doubt though, it is the most iconic Bond film.  Screenplay  Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins  Where Goldfinger went big, Thunderball went bigger. Back came the DB5 for the pre-title sequence as well as a Bell-Textron jet pack in this story of SPECTRE holding the West to ransom", "truth": ["love"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3497", "mistake": "From Russia With Love", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.4}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: Which is the only cactus fruit that is widely eaten? </s> Context: Edible Desert Plants \u2013 Barrel Cactus Fruit | wryheatEdible Desert Plants \u2013 Barrel Cactus Fruit | wryheat  Search for:  Edible Desert Plants \u2013 Barrel Cactus\u00a0Fruit  The Arizona-Sonoran Desert region has more wild edible plants than anywhere else on the planet according to ethnobotanists. We have cactus fruit, beans from mesquites and palo verde trees, yuccas, agaves, and nut trees, to name just a few edible plants.  Today, I will focus on the barrel cactus. Most cacti bloom in the spring. The barrel cacti bloom and set fruit in the summer. All cactus fruit is edible, none are poisonous, but not all are palatable. The best cactus tasting fruit comes from the saguaro, prickly pear, and barrel cactus.  There are six species of barrel cactus in the region. The most common in the Tucson area are Ferocactus wislizeni, the Fishhook barrel, and Ferocactus emoryi, Coville barrel. The Fishhook commonly grows 2- to 4 feet high, but some can reach 10 feet. Coville is generally 1- to 4 feet. The flower color of Coville is bright red; the Fishhook flower is usually orange, but can also be yellow or red.  The spines of the Fishhook are strongly-hooked and surrounded by several radial spines. The main central spine of the Coville is usually red, flattened and hooked. The few radial spines are relatively wide.  The fruit starts out green, but gradually ripens to yellow. Together with the withered flower, the fruit looks like a miniature pineapple. Because the fruit is relatively dry, it does not rot away like the fruits of saguaros and prickly pears. It is common to have the fruit remain on the plant for a year \u2013 until something picks it off.  I especially like barrel cactus fruit because it is the only one without spines; it can be picked and eaten raw right off the plant; both the flesh and the seeds inside can be eaten raw or cooked. The flesh is slightly mucilaginous (slimy like okra). The taste is tart; somewhere between lemon and kiwi fruit. The seeds may be separated and ground to a mush. If you pick a fruit that has been on the cactus for sometime, check for insects unless you don\u2019t mind the extra protein. The flower buds can be eaten also. The buds were often boiled and used like cabbage by native tribes.  Cactus fruit in general is rich in vitamin A and vitamin C. There is clinical evidence that the juice of the fruit of prickly pears lowers blood cholesterol. This may be a characteristic of most cactus fruit, but only prickly pears have been tested so far. If you have a barrel cactus in the yard, and the fruit is yellow, try taking a bite, they are good.  You may notice that barrel cacti frequently lean in one direction \u2013 toward the south. This is a reliable indicator of direction in the desert. They lean south so the top can get the most sunlight.  It is reported that Seri Indians sometimes used the Fishhook barrel for emergency water. However, drinking the juice on an empty stomach often causes diarrhea, and some Seri report pain in their bones if they walk a long distance after drinking the juice. The Seri called the Coville, \u201cbarrel that kills\u201d because eating the flesh of the cactus (not the fruit) causes nausea, diarrhea, and temporary paralysis, but the pulp can be used as an external analgesic.

{"input": "Question: What nation put the first manmade satellite in orbit, the 3 first man in space and the first woman in space? </s> Context: First man in space - Apr 12, 1961 - HISTORY.comFirst man in space - Apr 12, 1961 - HISTORY.com  First man in space  Publisher  A+E Networks  On April 12, 1961, aboard the spacecraft Vostok 1, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin becomes the first human being to travel into space. During the flight, the 27-year-old test pilot and industrial technician also became the first man to orbit the planet, a feat accomplished by his space capsule in 89 minutes. Vostok 1 orbited Earth at a maximum altitude of 187 miles and was guided entirely by an automatic control system. The only statement attributed to Gagarin during his one hour and 48 minutes in space was, \u201cFlight is proceeding normally; I am well.\u201d  After his historic feat was announced, the attractive and unassuming Gagarin became an instant worldwide celebrity. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and given the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Monuments were raised to him across the Soviet Union and streets renamed in his honor.  The triumph of the Soviet space program in putting the first man into space was a great blow to the United States, which had scheduled its first space flight for May 1961. Moreover, Gagarin had orbited Earth, a feat that eluded the U.S. space program until February 1962, when astronaut John Glenn made three orbits in Friendship 7. By that time, the Soviet Union had already made another leap ahead in the \u201cspace race\u201d with the August 1961 flight of cosmonaut Gherman Titov in Vostok 2. Titov made 17 orbits and spent more than 25 hours in space.  To Soviet propagandists, the Soviet conquest of space was evidence of the supremacy of communism over capitalism. However, to those who worked on the Vostok program and earlier on Sputnik (which launched the first satellite into space in 1957), the successes were attributable chiefly to the brilliance of one man: Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Because of his controversial past, Chief Designer Korolev was unknown in the West and to all but insiders in the USSR until his death in 1966.  Born in the Ukraine in 1906, Korolev was part of a scientific team that launched the first Soviet liquid-fueled rocket in 1933. In 1938, his military sponsor fell prey to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges, and Korolev and his colleagues were also put on trial. Convicted of treason and sabotage, Korolev was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. The Soviet authorities came to fear German rocket advances, however, and after only a year Korolev was put in charge of a prison design bureau and ordered to continue his rocketry work.  In 1945, Korolev was sent to Germany to learn about the V-2 rocket, which had been used to devastating effect by the Nazis against the British. The Americans had captured the rocket\u2019s designer, Wernher von Braun, who later became head of the U.S. space program, but the Soviets acquired a fair amount of V-2 resources, including rockets, launch facilities, blueprints, and a few German V-2 technicians. By employing this technology and his own considerable engineering talents, by 1954 Korolev had built a rocket that could carry a five-ton nuclear warhead and in 1957 launched the first intercontinental ballistic missile.  That year, Korolev\u2019s plan to launch a satellite into space was approved, and on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 was fired into Earth\u2019s orbit. It was the first Soviet victory of the space race, and Korolev, still technically a prisoner, was officially rehabilitated. The Soviet space program under Korolev would go on to numerous space firsts in the late 1950s and early \u201960s: first animal in orbit, first large scientific satellite, first man, first woman, first three men, first space walk, first spacecraft to impact the moon, first to orbit the moon, first to impact Venus, and first craft to soft-land on the moon.

The text on this page, has been taken from \u201cWalton \u2013 A Celebration \u2013 2002\u201d, published by William Walton Trust, March 2000. A comprehensive guide to Walton at the Centenary of his birth: the man, his music and the development of his legacy.  William Walton is one of the three indisputable leaders of the first generation of 20th century British composers, together with Michael Tippett (three years younger) and Benjamin Britten (eleven years younger). Their immediate musical forbears were Vaughan Williams (b 1872) and Holst (b 1874) and all were contemporary with Edward Elgar (b 1857) who lived until 1934. Of these illustrious names, Walton was the closest in style and temperament to Elgar and his personal background was remarkably similar. Both were born in provincial towns to lower middle class parents and both had no formal musical education at a college or academy. But Walton achieved fame earlier in his life.  William Turner Walton was born on 29 March 1902 at 93, Werneth Hall Road, Oldham, Lancashire. His father Charles Walton had been one of the first intake in 1893 at the new Royal Manchester College of Music, where he was a bass-baritone pupil of Andrew Black, who, five years later, was to create the title-part in Elgar\u2019s Caractacus. Charles became organist and choirmaster at St John\u2019s Church, Werneth, for 21 years and also taught singing and the organ elsewhere. His wife, Louisa Maria Turner, was a good amateur contralto. William and his elder brother sang in the St John\u2019s Choir. William also learned to play the piano and (for a brief time) the violin. His musical talent was obvious and when he was ten he was entered for a voice trial for probationer choristers at Christ Church Cathedral School, Oxford. Although he arrived late because of a missed train, his mother pleaded for him to be heard and the organist, Dr H.G.Ley, accepted him after he sang Marcello\u2019s \u2018O Lord Our Governor\u2019. So William exchanged the \u2018nightmare\u2019 of a board school in Oldham for an Oxford boarding-school where his first term was made \u2018odious\u2019 for him because of his Lancashire accent, which he later learned to conceal (although never entirely).  Walton was at the choir school from 1912 to 1918. When war was declared in 1914, Charles Walton\u2019s singing pupils declined in number and William would have been brought home to become an office-boy or to work as a clerk in a cotton-mill if Dr Thomas Strong, Dean of Christ Church, had not himself paid the balance of the school fees not met by the scholarship. Dr. Strong was a firm believer in the boy\u2019s talent. Walton was by then composing anthems and songs, some of which Strong showed to Sir Hubert Parry who remarked: \u2018There\u2019s a lot in this chap, you must keep an eye on him!\u2019 Walton\u2019s version of why he started composing was \u2018I must make myself interesting somehow or when my voice breaks, I\u2019ll be sent home to Oldham\u2019. His musical education at Oxford was supervised by Hugh Allen, then organist of New College and later professor of music at Oxford University and Director of the Royal College of Music. Through Allen and Strong he was introduced to the music of Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Ravel, Debussy and Prokofiev, the avant-garde of the time. He passed the first half of his Bachelor of Music exam in June 1918, but failed the exam called Responsions at three attempts in 1919. He passed the second part of his B. Mus. in June 1920 (and received the honorary degree of Doctor of Music in 1941). His musical education had continued in the holidays at Oldham: his father took him to Hall\u00e9 concerts in Manchester and he attended performances of Sir Thomas Beecham\u2019s famous opera seasons in Manchester in 1916 and 1917.

During the 1970s, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Italy formed the Group of Six (G6) as an informal grouping of advanced industrialized economies that would meet annually to discuss matters of political and economic significance. Canada was added in 1976 to form the Group of 7 (G7). In 1997, Russia joined, creating the Group of 8 (G8).  The European Union also participates in the G8 and is represented by the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission.  History  During the early 1970s, the United States held a series of informal meetings with financial officials from the United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, and France to discuss economic challenges facing advanced industrial economies. In 1975, French President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing invited the heads of state and government from these countries and Italy to Rambouillet, France for a summit to discuss the oil crisis and economic recovery.

The following year, Canada was invited to join the group for a summit in Puerto Rico under the presidency of the United States, forming the Group of Seven (G7) in 1976.  In 1977, the President of the European Commission was invited to attend the meeting. The President of the European Council now regularly attends as well.  Russia began to engage in separate meetings with G7 leaders in 1994 and formally joined the group in 1997 at the invitation of U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Delays had occurred as a result of the Olympics collision with the HMS   Hawke in September 1911 and in February the Olypmic also lost a propeller. The   owners wanted to see the Olympic operational before the Titanic.  Also that year there was a coal strike. A severe problem for   any transatlantic liner because ships like the Titanic would consume over 600   tons of coal a day. To partially solve the problem, coal was taken from other   ships like the Adriatic and Oceanic to stock up the coal bunkers for the   Titanic's voyage.  \u00a0  At noon on the 10 April 1912 the Titanic set sail from Southampton. Immediately,   there was a potential disaster. There was a near collision with the steamer New   York. The New York being much smaller than the Titanic was sucked in to her wake   as the Titanic giant triple screw propellers rotated. The New York's mooring   snapped and was dragged towards the port side of her. This is exactly what   happened to her sister ship when she collided with the HMS Hawke.  The Titanic sailed to Cherbourg in France and later to Queenstown in Ireland to pick up additional passengers. There were 1320   passengers and 907 crew.  The first few days of the voyage were uneventful. Captain Smith   steadily increased speed day by day. The ship covered 386 miles on the first   day, 519 the second and 546 miles the third. It was reported that Smith would   have increased the mileage day by day.  The passengers were unaware that one of the coalbunkers had   been on fire since departure. Situations like this were common because coal dust   which is very flammable, got everywhere, not just in the air but in machinery.   As the slightest spark could ignite the whole bunker, coal had to be kept   sufficiently damp to prevent fires from starting.  The fire on board the Titanic took until Sunday night to be put   out.

Asgard: Mythology and HistoryAsgard: Mythology and History  Beowulf  Beowulf is a hero of an old English poem of the same name.  Beowulf, the son of Ecgtheow and nephew of Hygelac, King of the Geats, whose kingdom was what is now Southern Sweden, was a warrior and king from Geatland. Quoting Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable, Beowulf :  In his boyhood Beowulf gave evidence of the great feats of strength and courage which in manhood made him the deliverer of Hrothgar, King of Denmark, from the monster, Grendel, and later in his own kingdom from the fiery dragon which dealt Beowulf a mortal blow.  Asgard  The name Asgard stems from the Scandinavian mythology.  Asgard is the abode of the celestials, Utgard is the abode of the giants. Midgard is between the two -- better than Utgard, but inferior to Asgard. Midgard is the abode of the first pair, from whom sprang the human race. It was made of the eyebrows of Ymer, and was joined to Asgard by the rainbow bridge called Bifrost.  From the Dictionary of Phrase and Fable , describing Asgard:  The fortress of the Asir or the Northern gods, the Olympos of Scandinavian mythology. It is said to be situated in the centre of the universe, and accessible only by the rainbow-bridge (Bifrost). The word As means a \"god,\" and gard an \"enclosure,\" our \"yard.\" Odin was priest of Asgard before he migrated to the Lake Logur or Moelar Sea  The kingdom of Asgard is the land surrounding and encompassing the city of Asgard, nestled within the Asgard Mountains and the Sea of Marmora.  Except for the densely-populated city of Asgard, the kingdom is a rolling green meadow dotted with small farms ( map of Asgard , more explanations ).  Quoting Norse Myths :  Thor is the mightiest of the Norse gods. Odin is his father; his mother is Earth. He drives a chariot pulled by two goats, and he has three great treasures: a belt that, when he wears it, doubles his strength; the terrible hammer Miollnir, with which he smites his enemies; and a pair of iron gloves, which he must wear to wield the hammer. Thor, red-bearded god of sky, is the guardian of Asgard, home of the gods, and of the homes and farmsteads of his worshipers.

{"input": "Question: Carried out by a military man it\u2019s called Seppuku. What other name is it known by? </s> Context: Seppuku - Psychology Wiki - WikiaSeppuku | Psychology Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Edit  Seppuku was a key part of bushido , the code of the samurai warriors; it was used by warriors to avoid falling into enemy hands, and to attenuate shame. Samurai could also be ordered by their daimyo (feudal lords) to commit seppuku.  Later disgraced warriors were sometimes allowed to commit seppuku rather than be executed in the normal manner. Since the main point of the act was to restore or protect one's honor as a warrior, those who did not belong to the samurai caste were never ordered or expected to commit seppuku. Samurai women could only commit the act with permission.  In his book The Samurai Way of Death, Samurai: The World of the Warrior (ch.4), Dr. Stephen Turnbull states:  Seppuku was commonly performed using a tant\u014d . It could take place with preparation and ritual in the privacy of one's home, or speedily in a quiet corner of a battlefield while one\u2019s comrades kept the enemy at bay.  In the world of the warrior, seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated, disgraced, or mortally wounded. It meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced. The cutting of the abdomen released the samurai\u2019s spirit in the most dramatic fashion, but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die, and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony.  Sometimes a daimyo was called upon to perform seppuku as the basis of a peace agreement. This would weaken the defeated clan so that resistance would effectively cease. Toyotomi Hideyoshi used an enemy's suicide in this way on several occasions, the most dramatic of which effectively ended a dynasty of daimyo forever, when the Hojo were defeated at Odawara in 1590. Hideyoshi insisted on the suicide of the retired daimyo Hojo Ujimasa , and the exile of his son Ujinao . With one sweep of a sword the most powerful daimyo family in eastern Japan disappeared from history.  Ritual  Edit  A tant\u014d prepared for seppuku  Women have their own ritual suicide, jigai . Here, the wife of Onodera Junai, one of the Forty-seven Ronin , prepares for her suicide; note the legs tied together, a female feature of seppuku to ensure a \"decent\" posture in death  In time, committing seppuku came to involve a detailed ritual. A Samurai was bathed, dressed in white robes, fed his favorite meal, and when he was finished, a Tanto or Wakazashi was placed on his plate.  Dressed ceremonially, with his sword placed in front of him and sometimes seated on special cloths, the warrior would prepare for death by writing a death poem .  With his selected attendant ( kaishakunin ,  his second) standing by, he would open his kimono (clothing), take up his wakizashi (short sword) or a tant\u014d (knife) and plunge it into his abdomen, making first a left-to-right cut and then a second slightly upward stroke to spill out the intestines .  On the second stroke, the kaishakunin would perform daki-kubi, a cut in which the warrior is all but decapitated (a slight band of flesh is left attaching the head to the body).  Because of the precision necessary for such a maneuver, the second was often a skilled swordsman.  The principal agrees in advance when the kaishaku makes his cut, usually as soon as the dagger is plunged into the abdomen.  This elaborate ritual evolved after seppuku had ceased being mainly a battlefield or wartime practice and become a para judicial institution (see next section).  The second was usually, but not always, a friend. If a defeated warrior had fought honorably and well, an opponent who wanted to salute his bravery would volunteer to act as his second.  In the Hagakure , Yamamoto Tsunetomo wrote:  From ages past it has been considered ill-omened by samurai to be requested as kaishaku.

The checkpoint on the Brunei side is called Puni and operates out of a wooden building located 500m from the ferry landing point.  Disputed territory  The dispute over Limbang district arose from the annexation of the district by Sarawak's Rajah Charles Brooke in 1890. The \"involuntary cession\" resulted in Brunei being split into two - the main part with three districts ( Brunei-Muara  ) to the west of Limbang, and the Temburong  district to the east of Limbang.  The de facto boundary ran along the watershed between the Brunei River and Limbang River basins on the western side of the district, and along the length of the Pandaruan River on the eastern side. Boundary agreements have delineated a stretch of the western border and the Pandaruan River while the other stretches have yet to be delineated.  The two countries agreed, via the signing of Exchange of Letters on 16 March, 2009, to settle their boundary issues and demarcate their common border according to the five historical agreements, of which the two directly concern Limbang, and to use the watershed principle to fill in the gaps. This essentially reaffirms the current de facto boundary without major deviation and has led Malaysia to declare that the Limbang Question has been settled with Malaysia having unequivocal ownership over Limbang. Brunei however immediately denied Malaysian press reports, saying the Limbang Question was never discussed during negotiations for the Letters of Exchange. Malaysia subsequently said the Limbang Question will be settled when the survey and demarcation of the boundary between the two countries is completed.  Notable places  Limbang Regional Museum  The Limbang Regional Museum is located in a fort built by Rajah Charles Brooke in 1897.

U.S.-BULGARIA RELATIONS  The United States established diplomatic relations with Bulgaria in 1903. A Consular Agency was established in Sofia on January 12, 1912. It reported to the Consulate General in Bucharest. The first American Consular Agent in Bulgaria was actually a Bulgarian national, Asen Kermekchiev (later Ace Kermek), a businessman, physician, and journalist. Kermekchiev served the United States Government even while working as a field doctor for Bulgaria in the First Balkan War, and was praised for protecting American lives and property while at the front. He also founded the first American Chamber of Commerce in Sofia. Bulgaria was allied with Germany in World War II, and became a satellite of the Soviet Union at the war's end. As Bulgaria emerged from communism in the 1990s, the United States moved to encourage development of multi-party democracy and a market economy.  Bulgaria is a reliable ally in an area of strategic importance to the United States. The U.S.-Bulgarian Defense Cooperation Agreement gives the United States military access to and shared use of several Bulgarian military facilities. The access facilitates joint training between the U.S. military and the Bulgarian and Romanian militaries. Bulgaria has participated in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), European Union (EU), and coalition operations, including in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Bosnia.  We work closely with the government of Bulgaria in strengthening the rule of law and have strong cooperation in law enforcement.  On any given day, there are approximately 7,000 Americans in Bulgaria.

HILLMAN (Great Britain) 1907-1976  William Hillman, a cycle manufacturer of 10 years' standing, commissioned Louis Coatalen to design his first car for the 1907 Tourist Trophy.  The 24 hp four-cylinder model was eliminated following a crash. Coatalen left to work wonders at Sunbeam, and Hillman settled down to producing modest and unspectacular models: these included a 9.7 litre six-cylinder car and a 6.4 litre four, though at the other extreme a 9 hp 1357cc car was more successful, spanning the war years and finally being discontinued in 1925, by which time it had grown to 1.6 litres.  A 14 hp model came out in 1926, and two years later the company was taken over by the Rootes brothers: a 2.6 litre straight-eight was an uncharacteristic offering for the marque. A landmark for Hillman came in 1932 with the appearance of the 1185cc Minx, while the sporting market was not neglected with the 1933 Aero Minx. There were some six-cylinder models, but by 1939 production was rationalized and only the four-cylinder Minx and 14hp models were offered.  The Minx soldiered on after the war and for 1949 received full-width bodywork and the following year a 1265cc engine. Overhead valves came late to the Minx, 1955 seeing their adoption with a 1390cc engine. The faithful Minx remained in production until 1970, by which time it was powered by a 1725cc engine.  The company's entry into the small-car market came with the Imp of 1963, which had a rear-mounted 875cc all-aluminium overhead camshaft engine and all-independent suspension, though it never achieved the hoped-for sales.  The American Chrysler Corporation attained a majority interest in Rootes in 1964 and one outcome of this take-over was the 1294cc Avenger of 1970. It was no surprise when the Hillman name ceased to appear in 1976, being replaced by the Chrysler trade mark.  In 1978 Chrysler's British operations were acquired by the French Peugeot-Citro\ufffdn group as part of their take-over of Chrysler-Europe.

Business so good that they separated and created separate bicycle companies with Hillman's operation being called Auto Machinery. In 1907 Hillman started making cars, launching a 24HP Hillman-Coatalen designed by Louis Coatalen before the Breton went on to join Sunbeam in 1909.  The first Hillmans were huge cars with engines up to 9-litres, but volume sales came with the introduction of the 9hp in 1913.  After the First World War engine sizes again grew with the Hillman 14hp being the big seller.  Hillman was now managed by John Black (later of Standard-Triumph) and Spencer Wilks (later of Rover). In 1928 Hillman was bought out by Humber and both were taken over by the Rootes brothers in 1931.  The Hillman Wizard was intended to relaunch Hillman, but that was only achieved with the 1932 Hillman Minx which was continuously produced in different forms until 1970.  After WW2 the Rootes Group shared more and more components amongst its brands so that the Hillman Minx ended up wearing 3 badges (4 if you count the export models badged as 'Humber'), and the engines were used in Sunbeam sports cars and Commer lorries too. In spite of some motorsport success and innovative engineering such as the Hillman Imp the Rootes Group was too weak to continue alone and from 1964 Chrysler bought into the Group and by January 1967 owned it all.", "truth": ["hillman"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6559", "mistake": "Hillman Motor Company", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.5}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

Mankiewicz, and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck. It was based on the 1946 short story \"The Wisdom of Eve\" by Mary Orr, although screen credit was not given for it.  The film stars Bette Davis as Margo Channing, a highly regarded but aging Broadway star. Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington, an ambitious young fan who insinuates herself into Channing's life, ultimately threatening Channing's career and her personal relationships. George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Barbara Bates, Gary Merrill, and Thelma Ritter also appear, and the film provided one of Marilyn Monroe's earliest important roles.  Praised by critics at the time of its release, All About Eve received 14 Academy Awards nominations (a feat unmatched until the 1997 film Titanic) and won six, including Best Picture. All About Eve is the only film in Oscar history to receive four female acting nominations (Davis and Baxter as Best Actress, Holm and Ritter as Best Supporting Actress).  All About Eve was selected in 1990 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry and was among the first 50 films to be registered. All About Eve appeared at #16 on AFI's 1998 list of the 100 best American films.   Plot  At an awards dinner, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter)\u2014the newest and brightest star on Broadway\u2014is being presented the Sarah Siddons Award for her breakout performance as Cora in Footsteps on the Ceiling. Theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) observes the proceedings and, in a sardonic voiceover, recalls how Eve's star rose as quickly as it did.  The film flashes back a year. Margo Channing (Bette Davis) is one of the biggest stars on Broadway, but despite her success she is bemoaning her age, having just turned forty and knowing what that will mean for her career. After a performance one night, Margo's close friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm), wife of the play's author Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), meets besotted fan Eve Harrington in the cold alley outside the stage door. Recognizing her from having passed her many times in the alley (as Eve claims to have seen every performance of Margo's current play, Aged in Wood), Karen takes her backstage to meet Margo. Eve tells the group gathered in Margo's dressing room\u2014Karen and Lloyd, Margo's boyfriend Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill), a director who is eight years her junior, and Margo's maid Birdie (Thelma Ritter)\u2014that she followed Margo's last theatrical tour to New York after seeing her in a play in San Francisco. She tells a moving story of growing up poor and losing her young husband in the recent war. Moved, Margo quickly befriends Eve, takes her into her home, and hires her as her assistant, leaving Birdie, who instinctively dislikes Eve, feeling put out.  Eve is gradually shown to be working to supplant Margo, scheming to become her understudy behind her back, driving wedges between her and Lloyd and Bill, and conspiring with an unsuspecting Karen to cause Margo to miss a performance. Eve, knowing in advance that she will be the one appearing that night, invites the city's theatre critics to attend that evening's performance, which is a triumph for her. Eve tries to seduce Bill, but he rejects her. Following a scathing newspaper column by Addison, Margo and Bill reconcile, dine with the Richardses, and decide to marry. That same night at the restaurant, Eve blackmails Karen into telling Lloyd to give her the part of Cora, by threatening to tell Margo of Karen's role in Margo's missed performance. Before Karen can talk with Lloyd, Margo announces to everyone's surprise that she does not wish to play Cora and would prefer to continue in Aged in Wood.

Gillian Gibbons was facing a second day of interrogation after being grilled for five hours yesterday.  She has now been moved from a local police station in Khartoum to the headquarters of the country's criminal investigation department for questioning by English-speaking officers.  Scroll down for more ...  The 54-year-old, who has been detained on suspicion of insulting the prophet, faces up to 40 lashes or six months in jail.  But there was specualtion today that the British woman could be charged with sedition, a far more serious charge than insulting Muslims, which carries a more severe sentence.  When the mother-of-two was arrested on Sunday an angry mob, chanting death threats, gathered outside her lodgings at Unity High School as she was led away by police.  But teachers at the fee-paying school, about a mile from the river Nile, have defended their colleague saying she made an innocent mistake.  Mrs Gibbons's arrest follows an exercise begun in September in which she requested a girl bring a bear to school and then asked the class to name it.  Twenty out of 23 children, aged six and seven, voted to call the bear Mohammed, from a shortlist of eight names including Abdullah and Hassan.  Each child was allowed to take the teddy home at weekends and write a diary about what each did with it.  One of the seven-year-old pupils in her class said he had chosen to call the teddy bear Mohammad because it was his own name.  Scroll down for more ...  The children wrote entries in a book with a picture of the teddy on the front and captioned \"My name is Mohammed\".  The child said: \"Some people took the teddy home and took it places with them like the swimming pool.\"  The book has now been seized by Sudanese police.  Mrs Gibbons is facing charges under sharia law for \"insulting ideology and religion\".  The incident risks sparking a major diplomatic row similar to that triggered when cartoons of the prophet appeared in Danish newspapers last year.  Mrs Gibbons, from the Aigburth suburb of Liverpool, moved to Sudan this summer, leaving her post as a deputy headteacher at Dovecot Primary School.  She left following the break-up of her marriage after more than 20 years to Peter Gibbons, a headmaster in Liverpool. The couple have two children, John and Jessica.  Former colleagues and neighbours spoke of their shock and described Ms Gibbons as somebody who \"wouldn't harm a fly\".  A source close to the school in Sudan, which has been closed until January for fear of reprisals, said one teacher was angered by the naming of the bear and complained to the head. Another report suggested several parents had made complaints.  Scroll down for more...  Unity is an independent school for Christian and Muslim children and is governed by a board representing major Christian denominations.  Mrs Gibbons has been visited in her cell by British consular staff and colleagues bringing food and water. Robert Boulos, the school's director, said: \"She is in very high spirits and is being treated well.\"  However, he added: \"This is a sensitive issue. We are very worried about her safety. This was an innocent mistake. Mrs Gibbons would have never wanted to insult Islam.\"  Sudan has been heavily criticised by Gordon Brown for its role in the mass killings of refugees in its Darfur region and there will be speculation that Khartoum is hitting back.

{"input": "Question: The chemical element antimony is found in nature mainly as which sulphite mineral? </s> Context: antimony element symbol,antimony electron configuration ...Description  \u00a0  Antimony is a toxic chemical element. It is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite. Although the use of antimony is limited by its toxicity, its compounds have been of fundamental value in chemistry. Antimony compounds are prominent fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. Certain alloys are valuable for use in solders and ball bearings. An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics. Few biological or medical applications exist for antimony. Treatments principally containing antimony are known as antimonials and are used as emetics. Antimony compounds are used as antiprotozoan drugs.  Chemical Properties  Antimony - Elements Wiki - WikiaAntimony | Elements Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia  Share  Antimony is a chemical element with symbol\u00a0Sb (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number\u00a051. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3).  Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were used  for cosmetics; metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously  identified as lead upon its discovery. It was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540.  For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan.  The industrial methods to produce antimony are roasting and subsequent  carbothermal reduction or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.  The largest applications for metallic antimony are as alloying material for lead and tin and for lead antimony plates in lead\u2013acid batteries. Alloying lead and tin with antimony improves the properties of the alloys which are used in solders, bullets and plain bearings. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics.  Antimony (Sb) - Chemical properties, Health and ...Antimony (Sb) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects  The ancients  Antimony  Antimony is a semimetallic chemical element which can exist in two forms: the metallic form is bright, silvery, hard and brittle; the non metallic form is a grey powder. Antimony is a poor conductor of heat and electricity, it is stable in dry air and is not attacked by dilute acids or alkalis. Antimony and some of its alloys expand on cooling.  Antimony has been known since ancient times. It is sometimes found free in nature, but is usually obtained from the ores stibnite (Sb2S3) and valentinite (Sb2O3). Nicolas L\u00e9mery, a French chemist, was the first person to scientifically study antimony and its compounds. He published his findings in 1707. Antimony makes up about 0.00002% of the earth's crust.  Applications  Very pure antimony is used to make certain types of semiconductor devices, such as diodes and infrared detectors. Antimony is alloyed with lead to increase lead's durability. Antimony alloys are also used in batteries, low friction metals, type metal and cable sheathing, among other products. Antimony compounds are used to make flame-proofing materials, paints, ceramic enamels, glass and pottery. The ancient Egyptians used antimony, in the form of stibnite, for black eye make-up.  Antimony in the environment  Antimony occurs naturally in the environment. But it also enters the environment through several applications by humans. Antimony is an important metal in the world economy. Annual production is about 50.000 tonnes per year, with virgin materials coming mainly from china, Russia, Bolivia and South Africa. World reserves exceed 5 million tonnes. In Finland there is a deposit of elemental antimony.  Health effects of antimony  Especially people that work with antimony can suffer the effects of exposure by breathing in antimony dusts. Human exposure to antimony can take place by breathing air, drinking water and eating foods that contain it, but also by skin contact with soil, water and other substances that contain it. Breathing in antimony that is bond to hydrogen in the gaseous phase, is what mainly causes the health effects.

ThesaurusAntonymsRelated WordsSynonymsLegend:  What separates Europe from Asia? | Reference.comWhat separates Europe from Asia? | Reference.com  What separates Europe from Asia?  A:  Quick Answer  The four geographical boundaries that divide Europe from Asia are the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles, the Caucasus and the Ural Mountains. Together, these four boundaries create a geographical line that stretches extends north to south through the western quarter of Russia, goes around the western boarder of Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea, and runs east to west along the northern border of Turkey and Azerbaijan.  Full Answer  The Bosphorus is a narrow straight that connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles is another narrow strait on the south side of the Sea of Mamara that connects it to the Aegean Sea. The Caucasus is a narrow bridge of land between the Caspian and Black Seas that includes many small republics with close ties to Russia, including Azerbaijan and Georgia. Finally, the Ural Mountains are a long mountain range in Russia that stretch from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Ural River in the south.  Russia lies on both sides of the Europe/Asia line. Siberia and the majority of the country's land is in Asia, while the largest cities in Russia are located in the western part of the country and therefore considered to be geographically in Europe.

He started his TV career as a presenter on the National Lottery show and Wheel of Fortune.  He is best known for playing the ruthless factory boss Danny Baldwin in Coronation Street, a role which won him a British Soap Award for Best Dramatic Performance in 2006.  In August 2008, Bradley appeared in the reality talent show television series Maestro on BBC Two.  While filming Law & Order UK Bradley wrote, directed and starred as Wishee Washee in his first pantomime alongside his former Coronation Street co-star, Eric Potts.  Danny BaldwinDanny Baldwin is a fictional character in the UK television ITV soap opera Coronation Street, portrayed by actor and TV presenter Bradley Walsh, who went on to portray the main character in Law & Order: UK. The character first appeared onscreen during the episode airing on 31 May 2004 and remained until his departure on 31 December 2006.  Storylines  Danny moved to Weatherfield to help his uncle Mike (Johnny Briggs) with his business. Not long after his wife Frankie (Debra Stephenson), who had previously cheated on him, arrives as she wants to give their marriage another chance. They are soon joined by Danny's sons, Warren (Danny Young) and Jamie (Rupert Hill). Unaware of Frankie's intentions, Danny has a brief fling with Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati) shortly after his arrival but Sunita does not know he is married and is very hurt when Frankie arrives. The Baldwins then rent Number 7 from Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones).   Danny's father, Harry dies, and his mother, Viv, (Patricia Brake), comes to stay and reveals to Mike and Danny a secret she had kept since his birth. Mike is Danny's biological father, the product of an affair she had with Mike. Danny's Uncle Harry had brought him up believing him to be his own son. Danny embarks on a passionate affair with Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), his son Jamie's girlfriend. When this is finally revealed, Jamie is heartbroken. Frankie throws Danny out and he moves in with Leanne.  Mike becomes ill with Alzheimer's disease. Danny is initially determined to use Mike's illness to gain control of the factory and Mike's other assets and manages to get power of attorney but as his condition deteriorates, Danny's emotions get the better of him and he is genuinely upset at the decline of his father. Mike's death in April 2006, hits Danny hard. Leanne, now engaged to Danny, finds a more recent will amongst Mike's belongings in which he leaves everything to his youngest son, Adam (Sam Robertson). Leanne uses the will to blackmail Danny, demanding \u00a3100,000 and leaves Weatherfield after Danny throws her out. Danny continues to try to reconcile with Frankie and nearly succeeds but is shocked and appalled to discover that Frankie is having an affair with Jamie. Danny goes on a downard spiral, sells his share of the factory to Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) who had already bought Adam's share, and leaves Weatherfield. He is last seen with a beautiful woman on his arm, ringing Jamie to wish him Happy New Year.  Creation and development  In an interview with Chris Evans on OFI Sunday on 11 December 2005, Bradley Walsh revealed that the character was originally to have been called Vic Baldwin, but that he asked the producers if the name could be changed to that of his own father, who had recently died.  In September 2010, Bradley Walsh revealed that he may reprise his role as Danny Baldwin on Coronation Street in the future. Walsh told Holy Soap: \"If the time was right for them and Danny Baldwin needs to go back, and the time is right for me where I've actually got some time to do it.

At the 1924 Summer Olympics he entered five events out of six and earned a gold or silver medal in each of them, winning individual medals in all three competitive fencing disciplines: \u00e9p\u00e9e, foil and sabre. Only one fencer in history did better \u2013 Nedo Nadi won five gold medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics.   During World War I Ducret was a prisoner of war.

Gaston AlibertGaston Alibert (February 22, 1878 in Paris \u2013 December 26, 1917) was a French fencer and olympic champion in \u00e9p\u00e9e competition.  He received a gold medal in \u00e9p\u00e9e individual and a gold medal in \u00e9p\u00e9e team at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.[http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g  5&sp=FEN \"1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 London, United Kingdom \u2013 Fencing\"] databaseOlympics.com (Retrieved on June 26, 2008) Eight years before, Alibert already participated in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris placing seventh in the \u00e9p\u00e9e individual event.  He contacted tuberculosis while at the front in World War I.  Olympic sportsOlympic sports are sports contested in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. The 2012 Summer Olympics included 26 sports, with two additional sports due to be added to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 2014 Winter Olympics included seven sports.  The number and kinds of events may change slightly from one Olympiad to another. Each Olympic sport is represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation (IF).  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) establishes a hierarchy of sports, disciplines, and events. According to this hierarchy, the Olympic sports can be subdivided into multiple disciplines, which are often assumed to be distinct sports. Examples include swimming and water polo (disciplines of Aquatics, represented by the International Swimming Federation),  or figure skating and speed skating (disciplines of Skating, represented by the International Skating Union).  In their turn, disciplines can be subdivided into events, for which medals are actually awarded. A sport or discipline is included in the Olympic program if the IOC determines it is widely practiced around the world, that is, the number of countries that compete in a given sport is the indicator of the sport's prevalence. The IOC's requirements reflect participation in the Olympic Games as well\u2014more stringent toward men (as they are represented in higher numbers) and Summer sports (as more nations compete in the Summer Olympics).  Previous Olympic Games included sports which are no longer present on the current program, like polo and tug of war.  These sports, known as \"discontinued sports\", were later removed either because of lack of interest or absence of an appropriate governing body. Archery and tennis are examples of sports that were competed at the early Games and were later dropped by the IOC, but managed to return to the Olympic program (in 1972 and 1988, respectively). Demonstration sports have often been included in the Olympic Games, usually to promote a local sport from the host country or to gauge interest and support for the sport.  Some such sports, like baseball and curling, were added to the official Olympic program (in 1992 and 1998, respectively). Baseball, however, was discontinued after the 2008 Summer Olympics.  Olympic sports definitions  The term \"sport\" in Olympic terminology refers to all the events that are sanctioned by one international sport federation, a definition that may be different from the common meaning of the word sport. One sport, by Olympic definition, may be divided into several disciplines, which are often regarded as separate sports in common language.  For example: Aquatics is a summer Olympic sport that includes six disciplines: Swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and high diving (the last of which is a non-Olympic discipline), since all these disciplines are governed at international level by the International Swimming Federation.

The story is set at Rugby School, a public school for boys, in the 1830s. Hughes attended Rugby School from 1834 to 1842.  The novel was originally published as being \"by an Old Boy of Rugby\", and much of it is based on the author's experiences. Tom Brown is largely based on the author's brother, George Hughes; and George Arthur, another of the book's main characters, is based on Arthur Penrhyn Stanley. The fictional Tom's life also resembles the author's in that the culminating event of his school career was a cricket match.  Tom Brown was tremendously influential on the genre of British school novels, which began in the 19th century, and is one of the few still in print. A sequel, Tom Brown at Oxford, was published in 1861 but is not as well known.

This classic tale of a boy's schooldays under the benevolent eye of the renowned Dr Arnold still retains the appeal for which it was acclaimed on its first publication in 1857.

Plot summary  Receiving a tip from his dentist Jack Shorter, Inspector Peter Pascoe takes a closer look at the Calliope Kinema Club, a film club notorious for showing adult entertainment movies. Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood, but when Pascoe starts investigating, he soon comes across the actress in question, Linda Abbott, who obviously didn't suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter's concerns are unnecessary. Meanwhile, the \"Calli\" has been vandalised and its proprietor Gilbert Haggard has been assaulted so badly that he succumbs to a heart attack. The only existing copy of \"Droit de Seigneur\" - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed, and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her (yet unborn) child, it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the \"Calli\".

It was shown on the ITV network in three parts over consecutive Saturdays beginning on 9 April. However, Reginald Hill is said to have been unhappy with the series and it subsequently remains the only one to star Hale and Pace in the leading roles. Dalziel and Pascoe was later picked up by the BBC where it enjoyed greater success. Since 1996, 11 series of Dalziel and Pascoe starring Warren Clarke and Colin Buchanan have been made up to 2007.

It is located in the narrow strait between the islands of Jura and Scarba. The names comes from the Gaelic, Coirebhreacain meaning \u201ccauldron of the speckled seas. Continue reading The Corryvreckan whirlpool \u2192  Corryvreckan Whirlpool: Overview of Corryvreckan WhirlpoolCorryvreckan Whirlpool: Overview of Corryvreckan Whirlpool  Corryvreckan Whirlpool  (Corrievrechan Whirlpool)  The world's third largest whirlpool, located in the Gulf of Corryvreckan between the islands of Scarba and Jura in the Inner Hebrides, is powered by the exceptional tidal races flowing around a rocky pinnacle which rises up 91m (298 feet) from the sea-bed to within 29m (95 feet) of the surface. This treacherous phenomenon varies in intensity both with the time of day and through the year, from flat-calm to a turbulent vortex.  Ancients believed that this was where The Cailleach (or the Hag of Winter - an old woman-goddess who spread the harsh weather of winter) washed her plaid. The name Corryvreckan (also Corrievrechan) means 'Breakan's Cauldron'. Legend states that a Norse Prince called Breakan, determined to prove he was fit to marry a local Princess, promised her father he would anchor himself over the whirlpool in a boat for three nights, entrusting his fate to the Cailleach. He had three ropes made; one each of hemp, wool and maidens' hair. It was believed that if the others failed, the purity and innocence of the maidens would give the final rope the necessary strength. On the first day the hemp rope parted, but they survived. On the second day, the wool rope parted but, again, they survived. However, on the third day the rope of hair broke too - a sign the maiden's who had supplied the hair were not as pure as all had believed - and Breakan's boat was sucked down into the whirlpool, drowning him along with most of his crew. Breakan's dog dragged his body ashore and he was buried in Breakan's Cave (Uamh Bhreacain) on the north coast of Jura .  The whirlpool features in the Powell and Pressburger film I Know Where I'm Going (1945), while in 1947, author George Orwell and his son were almost killed here in a small boat having miscalculated the tides while living nearby at Barnhill on Jura .  Remarkably, the pinnacle is popular with divers, who have to take extreme care to dive only in the narrow window in time when the whirlpool is inactive. Tourists can visit the whirlpool in boats from Ardfern , Balvicar , Craobh Haven and Easdale .

A:  Quick Answer  Peter Parker, a character from Marvel Comics, works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle newspaper. Parker is secretly the superhero Spider-Man. However, he has held other jobs throughout his run, including working as a research scientist, assistant high school coach, and president and CEO of Parker Industries.  Full Answer  One of Parker's earliest jobs was professional wrestler, after he acquired his superpowers but before he became interested in fighting crime. He also made paid appearances on television in the comics universe. After becoming a superhero, Parker needed to come up with another way of making money. He started working for the Bugle, taking photos of criminals and of himself as Spider-Man while on his adventures and selling them for the paper to print.  Peter Parker (Earth-616) - Marvel Database - WikiaPeter Parker (Earth-616) | Marvel Database | Fandom powered by Wikia  Main article: Peter Parker (Earth-616)/Expanded History  Early Life  Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens to CIA agents Richard and Mary Parker . While Peter was still an infant, his parents were assigned to infiltrate the Algerian based spy ring controlled by the communist agent, the Red Skull (Albert Malik) . The moment the Red Skull learned that Richard and Mary were double agents, he had them killed by one of his agents, the Finisher , in an airplane crash overseas and then framed them for treason. [32] Peter went to live with his uncle and aunt, Ben and May Parker , in Forest Hills , New York ; they became Peter\u2019s surrogate parents and raised him as if he were their own son. Over the next nine years, Parker grew to be extremely bright in science and became a high honors student at Midtown High School . Parker's shyness and scholastic interest often made him a social outcast and a target for bullies, primarily football star Flash Thompson .  Becoming Spider-Man  While attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear laboratory waste materials, sponsored by the General Techtronics Corporation , the 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten on the hand by a spider that had been irradiated by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration. Unbeknownst to him, after the spider fell from his hand, it bit a girl, Cindy Moon on the ankle before it died from the radiation. [33] Making his way home afterwards, Peter was almost hit by a car; when Peter jumped out of the way, Peter discovered he had somehow gained incredible strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls, spider-like traits that he immediately associated with the spider bite. [1]  Introducing: Spider-Man!  Encountering an ad offering a cash prize for staying in the ring for three minutes with professional wrestler Joseph \"Crusher\" Hogan , Peter decided this would be a good way to test his powers. Wearing a mask to avoid potential embarrassment in case he lost the match, Peter easily defeated his opponent. TV producer Maxwell Shiffman observed his performance and convinced him to go on television with his 'act.' Designing a full costume and fabricating a fluid similar to a spider's web and wrist-mounted web-shooters , Peter called himself Spider-Man , becoming an immediate sensation.  Following his first TV appearance, Peter failed to act to stop an escaping thief , claiming that it was not his responsibility to do so. Peter forgot the incident as his fame rose, but days later he returned home at night to find his Uncle Ben had been murdered. Learning the police had the burglar responsible holed up in a warehouse, Peter changed to Spider-Man and easily captured him only to discover he was the same thief he had allowed to escape earlier. Filled with remorse, he realized that when someone has power, he has an obligation to use it responsibly, so he decided to become a superhero.

{"input": "Question: On a standard dartboard, which number lies between 4 and 6? </s> Context: Public Management Statistics Class 13 Notes - udel.eduPublic Management Statistics Class 13 Notes  Agresti and Finlay, Statistical Methods, Chapter 4, pages 86-99.  QUESTION:  Based on Agresti and Finlay's problem 4-19 (page 113).  \"The Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development is a standardized measure used in longitudinal follow-up of high risk infants. It has approximately a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 16.\"  What proportion of children have MDI scores of at least 120?  AREAS UNDER THE NORMAL CURVE:  Before answering this question lets review briefly areas under the normal distribution.  Area between one and minus one standard deviation.  As we saw several times before, the area between  1.0 standard deviation is about 67%. Since the total area equals 1.0, the area above and below 1 standard deviation is 100% - 67%  34% (or in proportions 1.0 - .67  .34.)  See the figure in previous notes  Area between  2 standard deviations is about 95%, again as seen before.  Area between  1.96 standard deviations.  As seen in Figure 1 below the area between -1.96 and +1.96 standard deviations is 47.5% + 47.5%  95 percent.  That means that about 5% of the area lies below -1.96 and +1.96 standard deviations.  Finally, the proportion of the area under the curve between  2.56 standard deviations of the mean is .99, as we have seen before and below in Figure 2.  It's natural to ask how one \"finds\" the area under a normal curve.  Note that although there a curve for every choice of and , they share common properties such as shape.  Hence, if one knows the areas for one normal distributions, it's easy to find the corresponding areas in another.  All that is necessary is to convert from one scale to another.  The standard normal distribution.  The areas under the curve of a normal distribution having mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1 has been extensively tabulated.  Instead of calling the variable scale Y it is labeled z. So the standard normal distribution shows how values of z are related to f(z) and one can determine the area between any two points along the z scale by referring to a table.  Computer programs (e.g., SPSS and MINITAB) compute the values directly, but we will use the table for most of our work.  Moreover we can convert any Y score to a z score, which means that we can find areas between any two points Y1 and Y2 by converting them to z1 and z2 and looking in the table of the standard normal.  STANDARDIZED OR Z SCORES:  To use the standard normal distribution we have to change raw data to \"standardized\" data.  Remember the standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.0, but we usually deal with different measurement scales where, for example, the mean might be 500 and the standard deviation 25. Thus, we wouldn't know from the table how much of the area is in the interval from, say, 463 to 589.  But we can find out by changing raw data to \"standardized\" or z scores.  To convert the data follow these steps:  Find the mean,  of Y, the variable of interest.  To convert a particular raw score to a standard or z-score use the formula:  z is called a standard value, a standardized value or a z score. They are all the same. z is obtained from the original data by subtracting the mean of the original data and dividing by the standard deviation.  Examples:  Suppose we have a batch of data with a mean of 90 and a standard deviation of 10. What is the z score corresponding to a raw score of 100?  Suppose now the data are such that the mean is 1053.72 and  is 105.69.

So swift is the onslaught of violently painful symptoms that many more victims probably sink and drown without a trace.  \"Very likely, a lot of people who go missing at sea are victims of sea wasps, and not shark attacks,\" said Thomas Helm, author of Dangerous Sea Creatures. \"That's because the violent sting of the sea wasp (Chironex fleckeri) has been known to cause death in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds, depending upon the victim's susceptibility to the creature's venom.\"  Laboratory experiments have shown the sea wasp's venom to be 700 times more powerful than that of the better-known Portuguese man-of-war. Scientists say the venom is similar to that of a cobra's, only deadlier.  \"Even a mild brush can cause intense pain,\" writes James B. Sweeney in Sea Monsters and Other Dangerous Marine Life. \"The only recourse is to get the victim to a hospital in the shortest possible time.\"  Only one person is known to have survived an encounter with a sea wasp, a 12-year-old boy who was stung while swimming in shallow waters off North Queensland in the early 1970s.  Unlike most jellyfish, the sea wasp is a fast swimmer, able to propel itself in a darting fashion. While it is unlikely that sea wasps deliberately attack people, their speed and haphazard maneuvering sometime make encounters unavoidable.  Although sea wasps have relatives as far away from Australia as the Atlantic coast of South America, most deaths have been reported from the southwest Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Attacks usually occur when a swimmer or diver bumps into a sea wasp's long, trailing tentacles.  At one beach in Brisbane, Australia, records show that sea wasps kill five times as many people as sharks.  The sea wasp belongs to the phylum of creatures called coelenterates - or cnidarians, as they are commonly known, a group that includes corals, jellyfish, sea anemones and their kin. All these animals are venomous, usually snaring prey with their long, threadlike tentacles armed with tiny, poisonous harpoons called nematocysts.  Once the venom from a sea wasp enters the human bloodstream, it can paralyze the heart in 30 seconds. The pain caused by the venom has been described as the most excruciating in the world.  The best thing to do, according to most experts, is to avoid waters that sea wasps are known to inhabit.  \"Stay out of those waters at all costs,\" advised Jeanne Hanson, author of The Beastly Book: 100 of the World's Most Dangerous Creatures. \"Although they can propel themselves through the water at about 6 yards a minute hoping to come upon food, they don't actually come after humans to attack.\"  Syndicated writer Randall Floyd lives in Augusta.

Another key influence was an amateur viticulturalist, James Busby, who arrived in the colony of New South Wales with around 500 vine cuttings from collections and private plantings in Europe and South Africa.

The eagerly awaited new series of the BBC\u2019s globally popular car show\u00a0 Top Gear\u00a0(BBC Two) roared off the starting grid on Sunday night and, really, the only surprise was how little things have changed under its new \u00a0presenters.  For months we\u2019d been bombarded with reports of the Herculean labours the new team \u2013 especially \u00a0co-hosts Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc \u2013 were engaged in shoring up the show following the departure of Clarkson and Co last year, to bring it, kicking and screaming into the 21st\u00a0century.  Chris Evans taking the Jaguar E-Type 4.2 for a spin Credit: Rod Fountain/BBC  But, honestly, what were they doing all that time? Practising doing donuts and honing their scripts? On the evidence of this slickly entertaining relaunch the effort went not into reinvention but into ensuring the mechanics of the existing show were preserved in aspic. If proof were ever needed that format is stronger than presenter here it was.  Watch | Chris Evans' career - in 60 seconds  01:02  Thus we got Evans hooting, chortling and churning out scripted one-liners like a ginger Jeremy replica as he squealed around a US air base in the Nevada desert, taking on racing driver (and new regular contributor) Sabine Schmitz in a muscle car face-off of Dodge Viper ACR v Corvette ZO6. At least she produced an unscripted moment when the fighter pilot \u201cwing man\u201d in her passenger seat threw up.

Still, few fans would bemoan the return of the Stig, (Evans, hilariously: \u201cWe got custody!\u201d) back doing lap times.  Watch | LeBlanc on Ariel Nomad: \"the most fun you can have with your clothes on\"  00:20  Indoors, the studio sequences were lively, if also slavish to the old style. There was no sign of the reported lack of chemistry between Evans and LeBlanc, and while the former worked the crowd like the polished media pro he is, the\u00a0Friends\u00a0star added some much needed sardonic grunt, instantly justifying his choice as co-host.

{"input": "Question: Which late English singer released albums entitled \u2018Frank\u2019 and \u2018Back to Black\u2019? </s> Context: Back to BlackBack to Black is the second and final studio album by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse, released on 27 October 2006 by Island Records. The album spawned five singles: \"Rehab\", \"You Know I'm No Good\", \"Back to Black\", \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" and \"Love Is a Losing Game\". Back to Black was acclaimed by music critics, who praised Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson's production, as well as Winehouse's songwriting and emotive singing style.  At the 50th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Back to Black won Best Pop Vocal Album and was also nominated for Album of the Year. At the same ceremony, Winehouse won four additional awards meaning that she ties with five other artists as the second-most awarded female in a single ceremony. The album was also nominated at the 2007 Brit Awards for MasterCard British Album and was shortlisted for the 2007 Mercury Prize. Back to Black sold 3.58 million copies in the UK alone, becoming the UK's second best-selling album of the 21st century. By 2013, the album had sold over 12 million copies worldwide.  A deluxe edition of Back to Black was released in November 2007, containing a bonus disc of B-sides, rare, and live tracks. Winehouse's debut DVD I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London, released that same month, includes a live set recorded at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London and a 50-minute documentary detailing the singer's career over the previous four years.  Background  Winehouse released her debut album, Frank, on 20 October 2003. Produced mainly by Salaam Remi, many songs were influenced by jazz, and apart from two covers, every song was co-written by Winehouse. The album received positive reviews   with compliments over the \"cool, critical gaze\" in its lyrics  and brought comparisons of her voice to Sarah Vaughan,  Macy Gray and others.  The album reached number 13 on the UK Albums Chart at the time of its release, and was eventually certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).  In 2004, Winehouse was nominated for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act at the Brit Awards,  while Frank made the shortlist for the Mercury Prize.  That same year, the album's first single, \"Stronger Than Me\", earned Winehouse and Remi an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song.   Recording  In contrast to her jazz-influenced debut album Frank, Winehouse's focus shifted to the girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up in the studio and on tour.  Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music.  In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as \"You Know I'm No Good\" and \"Rehab\" appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of \"Pumps\" and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work.  She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard.   Tom Elmhirst, who remixed the single \"You Know I'm No Good\", was enlisted to help with the mixing of the album. He first received Ronson's original mix, which he described as being \"radical in terms of planning, kind of Beatlesque.\" Elmhirst panned the song's drums to one side.

{"input": "Question: Which 590 mile long river rises on France's 'Langres Plateau', enters Belgium at Givet, then flows across that country to Holland and thence to the North Sea? </s> Context: GivetGivet is a commune in the Ardennes department in northern France very close to the Belgian border. It lies on the river Meuse where Emperor Charles V built the fortress of Charlemont. It borders the French municipalities of Fromelennes to the east and Rancennes to the south and Foisches to the southeast.   Later on, another building was added to the fort, the Caserne Roug\u00e9, the longest barracks of France at that time, named after Pierre Fran\u00e7ois, Marquis de Roug\u00e9, general of the French armies k.a. 1761.  History  The town's history claims that Saint Hubert lived there in 720 and performed a miracle. The town has changed hands several times since the Roman era before becoming part of France in 1678, and was later invaded by Russians and Germans.  In World War II, Givet was occupied by the Germans on May 12, 1940. The city was liberated September 7, 1944. By December 1944, 11,000 American soldiers were billeted in the ancient Charlemont fortress. The German Ardennes Offensive targeted Givet and its crossing of the Meuse.  The British, under Montgomery, organized a last-ditch defense, and on 24 December, the German drive was stopped about 10 kilometers from Givet.  Population  FranceFrance (French:), officially the French Republic (), is a sovereign state comprising territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. France spans 643801 km2 and has a total population of 66.7 million. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. During the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people. The area was annexed in 51 BC by Rome, which held Gaul until 486, when the Germanic Franks conquered the region and formed the Kingdom of France.   France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages, with its victory in the Hundred Years' War (1337 to 1453) strengthening state-building and political centralization. During the Renaissance, French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would be the second largest in the world.  The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). France became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power under Louis XIV.  In the late 18th century, the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy, established one of modern history's earliest republics, and saw the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day.   In the 19th century Napoleon took power and established the First French Empire, whose subsequent Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of continental Europe. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870. France was a major participant in the First World War, from which it emerged victorious, and was one of the Allied Powers in the Second World War, but came under occupation by the Axis Powers in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Algeria and the colonies in Indochina became independent in the 1950s after long, bloody wars. Nearly all the other colonies became independent in the 1960s with minimal controversy and typically retained close economic and military connections with France.   France has long been a global center of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts Europe's third-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites (after Italy and Spain) and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually, the most of any country in the world.  France is a developed country with the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP  and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity.

{"input": "Question: In which English city would you find Winson Green Prison? </s> Context: BBC - Birmingham - Places - Behind BarsBBC - Birmingham - Places - Behind Bars  You are in: Birmingham > Places > BBC Birmingham > Behind Bars  Behind Bars  By Reena Jaisiah, contributor and Arshia Riaz, BBC  What is it really like inside a UK prison? Well this Birmingham woman spent a day inside Winson Green \u2013to try and find out what life was like for offenders!  Reena behind bars (taken by Naveen Kataria)  On Tuesday 2 June 2009, 29-year-old Reena Jaisiah decided to take part in a ten week course run by Birmingham based organisation Prison Link. The idea of the scheme is to give people an insight into the workings of prison life and to give them a real taster of what it feels like to be behind bars.  Here is Reena's story:  By day I work as a teacher and shop owner and I am also the co-founder of a theatre company called Caste Away Arts. The company's ethos is to uncover taboo issues that society often brushes under the carpet.  Reena at her workplace (taken by Naveen Kataria)  I love investigating issues and bringing them to life through theatre. One of my passions was to find out what it would be like to work inside prison and what it would be like to work with young offenders. So when I heard about this opportunity I jumped at the chance.  The day I got sent down  It was a scorching hot summer's day and before entering the prison I would have assumed that it would be cooler once I was inside. But I was wrong - it wasn't.\u00a0 How silly was I to expect a privilege like air conditioning in a prison.  I was searched, but not as rigorously as I expected; it was very swift and there was a huge queue of people going in. It was a busy place and I remember hearing the clanging of gates and bars. It seemed to be one thud after the other as people were coming in and out by the tens and twenties. It was quite exciting in a bizarre kind of way until the main gate shut hard behind me. I was inside and this is where the real journey started.  Winson Green Prison  As I was escorted to the cell block through an outdoor yard, I caught sight of a gloomy gothic building with hundreds of rows of tiny translucent murky glass columns in the wall. They were densely packed, almost like stain glass windows but without fancy colours and just the stains of thick dirt. Those tiny oblong rows were not there for decoration but were in fact, windows to the cells. This was daunting and a shiver went through my spine.\u00a0  I finally reached the cell block and was allowed to see a single cell which wasn\u2019t so bad. It was roughly the same size as the box room I had as a young girl. There was a small TV (no LCD screens or anything above 15 inch) with a single size bed. With a bit of personal touch it could be reasonable. Then I went into a communal cell. This was completely a different story.  There was barely any space for just me, let alone another person. There was a toilet in the corner of the room with no seclusion. The smell was revolting. I wanted to scream \u2018get me out of here'\u00a0 but thankfully this prison visit was not permanent and was part of the course.  The day I met a murderer  (I have protected the identity of the ex-offender by giving him an alias name)  The Prison Link course outline stated that there would be a session with an ex-offender- little did I know I would be in the same room as a convicted murderer.  When David walked in I saw a very ordinary looking man. I just thought he was a latecomer onto the course, no different to you and me, but as his story unfolded I was compelled. He revealed he was a convicted murderer.  He didn't look like a murderer but then what was a murderer supposed to look like? David\u2019s story was chilling.

(with Pictures)How Many Dominoes are in a Set? | Our Pastimes  How Many Dominoes are in a Set?  By Kristen May  Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media  Dominoes have a long history as playing pieces for a variety of games, and they come in sets of many sizes. The size of the domino set depends on the largest number of dots, or pips, appearing on one side of the domino. A set of dominoes will have anywhere from 28 to 190 pieces.  History  Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media  Most evidence points to dominoes having been created by the Chinese, some time before A.D. 1120, when the official invention is credited to a statesman who presented a set of dominoes to Emperor Hui Tsung.  European dominoes, which are the variety most commonly found today, were probably introduced around or before the early 18th century. They moved from Italy to France, Great Britain and beyond.  Double Six  Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media  A set of double-six dominoes, the most common set available, contains 28 dominoes with every possible combination of halves containing from zero to six dots on each side. The pieces in a double-six set are 0-0, 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 0-5, 0-6, 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 4-4, 4-5, 4-6, 5-5, 5-6, 6-6.  Formula  Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media  A faster way of figuring out how many dominoes are in a set is by using a formula. When looking at the above list of dominoes, you notice that there are seven dominoes in the first set starting with 0, six starting with 1, five starting with 2, and so on to just one domino starting with 6. The total number of dominoes in the set is then 7+6+5+4+3+2+1=28.  The formula to find the number of dominoes in a set is (n+1)(n+2)/2, when n is the biggest number of dots that appears on one side of a domino.  Larger Sets  Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media  Dominoes also come in larger-sized sets. Double-nine dominoes are the next biggest set, and they contain 55 dominoes. There are 91 dominoes in a set of double 12s, and 136 in a set of double-15s. The largest commercially available set of dominoes is double18s, which consists of 190 dominoes.  Games  Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez de la Pe\u00f1a/Demand Media  A number of games can be played with a set of dominoes. The most common is one in which players each draw a certain number of dominoes from which to play, and lay each new domino so it touches another domino with an end of the same number. Scoring depends on the game variation, but usually the hand ends when one player has played all his pieces.

{"input": "Question: What is the generic title of a series of French comic strips that were written originally by Ren Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo? </s> Context: Albert UderzoAlberto Aleandro Uderzo (;; born 25 April 1927), known as Albert Uderzo, is a French comic book artist and scriptwriter. He is best known for his work on the Ast\u00e9rix series and also drew other comics such as Oumpah-pah, also in collaboration with Ren\u00e9 Goscinny.  Uderzo retired from drawing in September 2011.   Early life  Uderzo was born in Fismes (Marne, France), to parents, Silvio (of Venetian descent) and Iria Crestini (of Tuscan descent), who had recently immigrated from La Spezia, Italy.  His childhood ambitions were to become an aircraft mechanic, despite his talents in art becoming apparent at an early age.     Uderzo obtained French citizenship in 1934, and during World War II, the teenaged Uderzo left Paris and spent a year in Brittany, where he worked on a farm and helped with his father's furniture business. He loved Brittany, both for its scenery and its people. In fact, many years later, when the time came to choose a location for Asterix's village, Goscinny left the decision entirely to Uderzo, only stipulating that it should be near the sea in case the characters needed to travel by boat. Uderzo had no hesitation in choosing Brittany.  Uderzo began a successful career as an artist in Paris after the war in 1945, with creations such as Flamberge and also Clopinard, a small one-legged old man who triumphs against the odds. From 1947 to 1948 he created some other comics, such as Belloy and Arys Buck.  Working with Goscinny  Throughout some more creations and travelling for the next few years, he eventually met Ren\u00e9 Goscinny in 1951. The two men quickly became good friends, and decided to work together in 1952 at the newly opened Paris office of the Belgian company, World Press. Their first creations were the characters Oumpah-pah, Jehan Pistolet and Luc Junior.   In 1958 they adapted Oumpah-pah for serial publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin, though it ran only until 1962.  In 1959 Goscinny and Uderzo became editor and artistic director (respectively) of Pilote magazine, a new venture aimed at older children. The magazine's first issue introduced Ast\u00e9rix to the French world, and it was an instant hit.  During this period Uderzo also collaborated with Jean-Michel Charlier on the realistic series Michel Tanguy, later named Les Aventures de Tanguy et Laverdure.  Ast\u00e9rix was serialised in Pilote, but in 1961 the first album Ast\u00e9rix le gaulois (Asterix the Gaul) was published as an individual album. By 1967, the comic had become so popular that both decided to completely dedicate their time to the series. After Goscinny's death in 1977, Uderzo continued to write and illustrate the books on his own, though at a significantly slower pace (averaging one album every three to five years compared to two albums a year when working with Goscinny). The cover credits still read \"Goscinny and Uderzo\".  Family  Uderzo married Ada Milani in 1953 and has one daughter Sylvie Uderzo (b. 1956).  According to The Book of Asterix the Gaul, it was speculated that Uderzo had based the characters Panacea and Zaza on Ada and Sylvie respectively, though this has been denied by Uderzo. When Uderzo sold his share of Editions Albert Ren\u00e9 to Hachette Livre, Sylvie accused him in a column in Le Monde, that with this action it was \"as if the gates of the Gaulish village had been thrown open to the Roman Empire\".

How many bones are in your body?  What keeps bones healthy?  Can you learn the names of your major bones?  Tags:  Listen  How does that old song go again? The knee bone's connected to the\u2026? Shin bone? Thigh bone? Both? Aarrgghh! We can't remember.  Anyway, we were WONDERing about bones the other day and wanted to know how many we had. We tried to count them, but then we realized they're all under our skin ! It would be much easier if we had see-through skin or a best friend who was just a skeleton .  Do you have any idea how many bones you have? Did you realize that the number of bones you have changes from when you're a baby to when you're grown up? It's true!  Babies start out with over 300 bones. Since babies have a lot of growing to do, some of the bones they'll have as adults start out in multiple pieces. Over time, these bones grow together to form one larger bone.  By the time you're an adult, you'll have exactly 206 bones. Over half of those bones can be found in your hands and feet! Your bones can be divided into two skeletal systems.  The axial skeleton contains all the bones in the trunk of your body (that's the middle part of your body that includes your spine ). The appendicular skeleton contains all the bones in your limbs (that includes your arms, hands, legs and feet).  Bones can be further classified into four categories. Short bones are, of course, short, and they help strengthen your skeleton . Long bones are \u2014 surprise! \u2014 long, and found in your limbs. Flat bones protect your organs and provide a spot for muscles to attach. Irregular bones are oddly-shaped bones that don't fit into any of the other categories.  You would look really funny without bones. Can you imagine being just a big blob of skin and muscles? It would be hard to do anything! Your skeleton gives your body shape, helps you move, protects your body, stores minerals, and helps to produce new blood cells.  It's important to take care of your bones and keep them healthy. Obviously , you can't take them out to inspect or clean, so how should you take care of them? Your bones are alive and, like all other living things, they need proper nourishment .  For example, you can help keep your bones healthy by making sure you get enough calcium . Calcium is a mineral that helps bones harden and become strong. Foods with calcium include dairy products, such as milk , cheese , and yogurt, and dark green vegetables like kale, broccoli, and spinach.  You can also keep your bones healthy by exercising . If you play sports, though, make sure that you protect your bones by wearing the proper safety equipment, including helmets and pads!

{"input": "Question: In Roman mythology, what was the name of the brother slain by Romulus? </s> Context: ROMULUS - the Roman legendary mortal (Roman mythology)ROMULUS - the Roman legendary mortal (Roman mythology)  ROMULUS  Founding father and patron God of Rome  ROMULUS and REMUS are twin sons of MARS and RHEA-SILVIA .  Being illicit and also next in line to the throne of Alba Longa, they were stuffed into a basket by their jealous great uncle Amalius and pitched it into the turbulent river Tiber.  The twins were washed ashore where they were rescued and suckled by a female wolf who had recently lost her cubs.  They thrived and were discovered by a Royal Gamekeeper, Faustulus before they had time to develop any werewolf tendencies. They were taught table manners and turned out to be bright lads who did well and decided to go into the building trade in a big way. Starting by planning a new city.  Sadly they could not agree on the exact location and ROMULUS drew the first ever picket line denying his brother to cross it. This cause a bad strike as REMUS immediately crossed the line which had only been drawn in the dust. So ROMULUS struck him. It was a very bad strike because REMUS fell fatally injured.  Undeterred, ROMULUS carried on. When completed he decided to call it Rome after himself. Having no established inhabitants this New Town seemed to attract dropouts, scoundrels and runaway slaves with a marked shortage of women.  ROMULUS came up with the idea of holding some Games \u2014 always a good way to draw crowds from afar. This was to be used as cover to abduct some ladies. The Sabines accepted the invitation, and didn\u2019t care for these Games at all as they were losing from the start. This led to an all out war, but ROMULUS promised JUPITER a temple to gain a sneaky victory.  Eventually there was peace and coalition between the Romans and Sabines, and Rome grew. ROMULUS made himself king and ruled for 33 years until he was carried off to Heaven by MARS during a solar eclipse to become a deity called QUIRINUS .  Or did he? Another version said he was nothing but a self-seeking scumbag and he was torn to bits in secret by senators and the remains and stains carefully obliterated. \u2018Romulus?

The FedExCup is a season-long competition that originated in 2007 to determine a champion of each season on the PGA TOUR. Players vie throughout the PGA TOUR Season to accumulate enough FedExCup points to earn spots in the FedExCup Playoffs, then battle for golf's richest prize during the four-week Playoffs.  Tiger Woods won the inaugural FedExCup and the $10 million top prize in 2007. He won for a second time in 2009. Others to hoist the FedExCup trophy include Vijay Singh (2008), Jim Furyk (2010), Bill Haas (2011), Brandt Snedeker (2012), Henrik Stenson (2013) and Billy Horschel (2014).

More  On Sunday, an envelope will be opened, and the winner of the 2016 Academy Award for Best Picture will be announced. One of eight films \u2014 just kidding: one of three films \u2014 will become a part of cinema record, never to be forgotten, and its cast and crew will forever be able to say that they helped to create a piece of history.  But even if The Revenant\u2019s late-breaking move into pole position doesn\u2019t translate into an Oscar, it will still have something no other movie can claim: a scene in which Leonardo DiCaprio is mauled by a bear. Aside from, well, any part of Mad Max: Fury Road, that bear's savagery has been, without question, the most talked-about element of any Oscar-nominated film this year, a subject for weird rumors and movie magic and pure, visceral emotion. To celebrate the real Best Supporting Actor of 2016, then, let\u2019s take a look back at the history of Hugh Glass and the Amazing Not-So-Dancing Bear .  September 29, 2015: The Revenant\u2019s official trailer is revealed by 20th Century Fox , and 50 seconds in, there it is: an angry bear whipping poor Leo back and forth like he\u2019s a rubber chew toy. Damn, America thought. Look at that bear mauling, but definitely not having sexual intercourse with, beloved movie star Leonardo DiCaprio.  December 1, 2015: Not so fast, America. Maybe you didn\u2019t immediately think, That bear is raping one of the last great icons of the silver screen, but Matt Drudge doesn\u2019t think like any ordinary person \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s made him one of our top aggregators of hysterical race-baiting, not to mention a leading wearer of hats . After two months of everyone thinking that what happens between Leo and the bear was a platonic attack, Drudge reports that the bear was in fact raping Hugh Glass \u2014 \u201cThe bear flips Leo over and thrusts and thrusts during the explicit mauling,\u201d he writes, before quoting an unnamed source as saying, \"He is raped \u2014 twice!\"  Predictably, the culture is thrown into a very confused frenzy. What to make of this new turn? Is The Revenant way weirder than we thought? Is I\u00f1\u00e1rritu just messing with us now?  December 1, 2015: So, uh, our Kyle Buchanan had already seen The Revenant, and the bear doesn\u2019t rape DiCaprio . Also, it\u2019s a momma bear. Soooooooooooooo ...  December 17, 2015: DiCaprio confirms: The bear did not rape him . \u201cI have no idea where these ridiculous things come from, and what you do when you hear stuff like that?\u2019 he says. \u201cIt's absurd. It's absurd.\u2019 Also, did you know he ate raw bison liver? Leo\u2019s going to tell you about the time he ate raw bison liver.  December 18, 2015: But I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s kind of into the idea. \u201cI have to say that my first thought was, \u2018Oh my God, that is a great idea \u2014 why didn\u2019t I shoot it like that?\u2019\u201d he told The Wrap . \u201cThat would have been one of the most memorable scenes ever.

{"input": "Question: When was the first stamp, the Penny Black, issued in Britain? </s> Context: Great Britain 1840 Penny Black - JustCollecting.comGreat Britain 1840 Penny Black  Great Britain 1840 Penny Black  0  0  The Great Britain 1840 Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp used in a public postal system.  It was issued by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 May 1840, for official use from 6 May of that year. Prior to the Penny Black's existence, post was paid for by the recipient, a process which was slow, expensive and inefficient.  Teacher and educational reformer, Rowland Hill had a new idea whereby postage was prepaid, which he claimed could reduce costs of the arduous handling involved in the old method. Hill's work inspired the Penny Black, a postage stamp which was paid for in advance and attached to the letter.  History and Design  The idea of a stamp to indicate pre-payment of postage (instead of the cost being paid on delivery) was that of the teacher and social reformer Sir Rowland Hill , as part of his plans to reform the British postal system. He described it as \"a bit of paper\u2026 covered at the back with a glutinous wash which the user might, by applying a little moisture, attach to the back of a letter\".  His proposals led him to be awarded a two-year contract to run the new system, and he launched the service in 1840 with a stamp bearing a representation of the easily recognisable profile of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria . This design, taken from a Commemorative Coins when she was a 15-year-old princess, was submitted in a competition by an engineer named Mr Cheverton. It was endorsed by Rowland Hill, who thought the design would prove difficult to forge. The image, printed in black, was based on a sketch provided by Henry Corbould and engraved by the father and son team of Charles and Fredrick Heath.  The design showing Queen Victoria, without country name, laid the foundations for British stamps. From then on, British stamps, known as definitives, were issued with a portrait - often in profile or semi profile - of the reigning sovereign. Together with the image, the word \u2018postage\u2019 appeared at the top of the stamp with its value \u2018one penny\u2019 at the bottom.  The original printing press for the Penny Black, the D cylinder press, was invented by Jacob Perkins and patented in 1819. It was printed with the line engraved printing method using 11 numbered plates. However, the first plate suffered much deterioration and was repaired to such an extent that it is generally thought of as two separate plates, making a total of 12.  In an attempt to prevent forgery the stamps had small crown watermarks on the back and letters in the bottom corners, which were impressed by hand.

Last Modified Date: 27 December 2016  Copyright Protected:  Top 10 amazing movie makeup transformations  The cuboid bone is one of the bones on the lateral side of the foot, also known as the outside of the foot. The bone plays a key role in the stability of the foot and the jointing of the foot and ankle. As the name implies, this bone is cube-shaped, and in fact, knucklebones, the original dice, used the cuboid bones from animal feet. When rolled, knucklebones would eventually settle on one side, and markings could be used to assign a value or action to the side facing up.  The back part of the cuboid bone articulates with the calcaneous bone to form the calcaneocuboid joint . In the front, the cuboid meets up with the fourth and fifth metatarsals, two long bones which articulate with the toes. One important role of this bone is as a stabilizer to keep the outside of the foot stable, allowing people to walk with confidence. Bipedal walking is actually a bit challenging, and the articulation of the bones in the feet is key to distributing the weight of the body so that people can walk comfortably.  Ad  One problem which can emerge with the cuboid bone is subluxation, in which the bone is pushed downward and out of place. People with subluxation of this bone, also known as cuboid syndrome, experience a dull ache along the middle of the outside of the foot. They may find that it's difficult to put weight on the foot, and the pain does not go away with rest or elevation. This condition can be treated with repositioning of the bone, padding, and bracing to keep the foot stable while the foot heals.  The cuboid bone can also become broken, usually through dancing, heavy physical activity, or severe trauma to the foot. A broken cuboid can be tricky to diagnose without the assistance of advanced medical imaging such as an MRI , as the break may remain concealed on a basic foot x-ray. Breaks are treated with casting and walking boots to keep weight off lateral side of the foot while the cuboid bone heals.  It can sometimes be difficult to determine whether foot pain is from a breakage or from a lesser problem like inflammation . A podiatrist, a doctor who specializes in foot care , can examine the foot and conduct an interview to learn more about the specific symptoms. The doctor may recommend some treatment measures to address the pain, including bracing and pain medications, to see if the pain improves before ordering medical imaging studies and considering casting and other options.

{"input": "Question: Which golf shot is the opposite of a slice? </s> Context: What Is a Slice in Golf?What Is a Slice in Golf? (And How to Fix Yours)  By Brent Kelley  Updated January 13, 2017.  A \"slice\" is a type of golf shot in which the golf ball curves dramatically in flight from left to right (for a right-handed golfer). The slice can be played intentionally, but is usually the result of a mishit. Slices are the most common problem for recreational and high-handicap golfers. The shape of a sliced shot differs for right-handed golfers and left-handed golfers (although the causes - more on that below - are identical):  For a right-hander, a slice curves to the right;  For a left-hander, a slice curves to the left.  (We'll stick with right-handedness in all examples to follow, so lefties need to reverse any directional elements.)  A slice and a fade shot \u00a0share the same shaping (curving to the right for a right-hander), except that a slice is more severe. A slang term for a slice is \" banana ball .\"  The slice is the opposite of a hook shot .  A sliced shot may start out left of the target line and then bend dramatically back to the right of the target.  continue reading below our video  Correcting a Slice  Or the ball can begin on the correct target line before swerving right. A shot that begins right of the target line and then curves farther right is a \"push-slice.\"  What Causes a Slice?  At its root, a sliced shot is caused by the clubface arriving at impact with the golf ball in an open position . This may be due to setup or swing issues that cause the face to open, or to an outside-to-inside swing path that effectively opens the face by \"wiping\" or \"swiping\" across the golf ball, imparting \"slice spin.\" (Slice spin is a clockwise sidespin for right-handed golfers, counter-clockwise for lefties.) Cutting across the ball at impact on an outside-to-inside swing path is also called \"coming over the top.\"  Those are the two primary causes of a slice, and in combination can create a much more severe slice.  Faults and fixes: More possible causes of a slice  How to Stop Slicing Your Shots  Is your golf game plagued by the dreaded slice? Start by checking out several of your fundamentals to make sure simple setup problems aren't causing that slice.  Make sure you are not gripping the club with the face in an open position. Unless you are trying to hit a ball that curves right (slice or fade) or left (hook or draw), set up with your clubface square. Or are you rotating the club open on the backswing? Make some backswings but stop when the club reaches parallel to the ground. The toe of your club should be pointing straight up. If it is \"laid off\" - pointing behind you - you already have an open clubface.  Make sure you are not setting up with an open stance (feet, hips, shoulders aligned left of the target line). Just like your clubface, you stance should be square.  Make sure your grip is in a neutral position and are you are not using a weak grip (hands turned too much to the left for a right-hander). Watch the video \" Strong and Weak Grips \" for details.  Often both the clubface position and the swing path must be corrected to permanently rid yourself of the unintentional slice. Watch:  Diagnosing and fixing a slice  There are many videos on YouTube from golf instructors that focus on the slice . And remember that the draw shot is the opposite of the slice, so teaching yourself how to draw the ball is also a way of eliminating the slice:  Video: How to hit a draw  It's always best to solve a problem in golf by fixing the root cause, such as a cluface position, swing path or setup issue", "truth": ["hook"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-379", "mistake": "the clubface arriving at impact with the golf ball in an open position", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: Which religion uses a domed structure called a Stupa as a shrine? </s> Context: Stupas | Kunzang Palyul Ch\u00f6lingStupas \u2013 Kunzang Palyul Choling  Symbols of Enlightenment  Stupas are sacred monuments that embody the enlightened mind.\u00a0  The word \u201cStupa\u201d is a Sanskrit word that literally means \u201cto heap\u201d or \u201cto pile up.\u201d\u00a0 The Monnier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary says the stupa is \u201c\u2026a Buddhist monument, (generally of a pyramidal or dome-like form created over sacred relics of the historical Buddha (563-478 BC) or on spots consecrated as the scenes of his acts); a relics shrine or relics casket.\u201d\u00a0 It goes on to say that \u2018stupa\u2019 was originally a topknot of hair, designating the upper part of the head, but subsequently became used as an architectural term, indicating a monument of a dome-shaped form over the sacred relics of the Buddha or other saints or venerable persons. The connection between Shakyamuni and a topknot is apparent since he is often depicted as having such a topknot symbolizing his attainment of Enlightenment.  Stupas were found in India before the birth of Buddha Shakyamuni where mounds of dirt were built around a tree as a tomb for the remains of important figures such as kings and heroes. It\u2019s said that the Buddha was the one who changed that practice when he asked that his own remains be placed within stupas that would represent the Awakened Nature, as a reminder of the potential for enlightenment within us all.  When it was time for Buddha Shakyamuni to pass into nirvana, he instructed his followers to cremate his body and place his relics in a stupa so that people of future generations could make a connection with Buddhism and experience the Buddha\u2019s blessings. What followed was a tradition of stupa building that resulted in many thousands of stupas being built all over Asia.\u00a0\u00a0 Stupas exist in every Buddhist country in the world and in every Buddhist tradition.\u00a0 They are places of pilgrimage for those seeking their blessings.  The Power of Stupas  Because every element of a Buddha\u2019s physical body is pervaded with the pure energy of Enlightened Mind, the teacher\u2019s remains after cremation are considered sacred.\u00a0 One sign that a teacher is an enlightened manifestation is that relics will be found in the ashes that resemble small, round pearls which can be white, red, or brown.\u00a0 These are often the relics that are put inside stupas being built today.  Stupas are an ancient form of sacred architecture that represent the heart of enlightenment \u2013 not just as a form of tribute but as a radiating presence that transmits blessings to all those who come in contact with them.\u00a0 If properly constructed and empowered, a stupa is like a spiritual generator.\u00a0 It broadcasts virtue of such power that it brings peace and harmony to all beings and balances the forces of nature.  A Stupa naturally establishes peace and harmony while subduing negative forces, like war and famine.\u00a0 It helps to prevent disease and brings blessings of health, prosperity and well being to the community.\u00a0 No matter the shape or style, a properly constructed and consecrated stupa provides the world a place of blessing and spiritual refuge.  Shakyamuni Buddha ignited an appreciation for the spiritual potency of stupas. The Buddha taught and demonstrated that stupas are powerful agents of purification and spiritual transformation. On one occasion he sent a dying man to restore and re-consecrate a stupa in disrepair. After the Brahmin completed the work according to the Buddha\u2019s instructions, his body became miraculously strong and majestic.  Symbolism of a Stupa  Stupas speak of enlightenment on many different levels. The outer form of a stupa represents a meditating Buddha, seated and crowned. When seen from above, a stupa is a perfect mandala, a pure distillation of the universe.  But that is only the beginning of a stupa\u2019s meaning. Every architectural feature of the stupa symbolically represents a facet of the spiritual path. For example, a stupa incorporates five basic geometric shapes that correspond to the five elements. Each element, in turn, corresponds to an essential attribute of a fully awakened being. The square base of the stupa represents earth and equanimity; the round dome, water and indestructibility; the triangular spire,", "truth": ["buddhist", "buddhism"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1098", "mistake": "Buddhist", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

Published on Nov 21, 2014  \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" is a song written and performed by the British new wave music duo Eurythmics (Annie Lennox and David A. Stewart). It was released as a single in early 1983, the title track of their album Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), and was one of their biggest hits, and the song which provided the group with their breakthrough into commercial success. Its striking music video helped to propel the song to #2 on the UK singles chart and #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100, on 3 September 1983, after The Police's \"Every Breath You Take\" had held it off at #2 for 4 consecutive weeks in August. It was the fourth and final single released from the Sweet Dreams album in the UK and the first single released by Eurythmics in the US.  \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" is arguably Eurythmics' signature song. Following its success, their previous single, \"Love Is a Stranger\", was re-released and also became a worldwide hit. On Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time issue in 2003, \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was ranked number 356; it was the Eurythmics's only song to appear on the list. Eurythmics have regularly performed the song in all their live sets since 1982, and it is often performed by Lennox on her solo tours.  This video is targeted to blind users.

Stewart, now disbanded but known to reunite from time to time.  Stewart and Lennox were both previously in the band The Tourists (originally known as The Catch), who split in 1980 and Eurythmics were formed that year. The duo released their first album, In the Garden, in 1981 to little fanfare, but went on to achieve global success with their second album Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), released in 1983. The title track was a worldwide hit, topping the chart in various countries including the US. The duo went on to release a string of hit singles and albums before they split in 1990. By this time, Stewart had already embarked on a parallel music career and was also a sought-after record producer, while Lennox began a solo recording career in 1992 with her debut album Diva. After almost a decade apart, Eurythmics reformed in the late 1990s to record their ninth album, Peace which was released in late 1999. They reunited again in 2005 to release the single \"I've Got a Life\", as part of a new Eurythmics compilation album, Ultimate Collection.

Gettysburg was the battle with the largest amount of casualties in the Civil War.  Full Answer  The Battle of Gettysburg is described as being the turning point of the American Civil War. At the dedication ceremony after the battle, President Abraham Lincoln addressed the redefined purpose of the war in the Gettysburg Address.  Today, there are two historical landmarks at the original battleground, the Gettysburg National Cemetery and the Gettysburg National Military Park.  Where did the Battle of Gettysburg take place? | Reference.comWhere did the Battle of Gettysburg take place? | Reference.com  Where did the Battle of Gettysburg take place?  A:  Quick Answer  The Battle of Gettysburg took place in and around Gettysburg, Penn. Most historians view this battle as the moment in the U.S. Civil War when the tide turned irrevocably against the Confederate forces.  Full Answer  While the majority of the Civil War was fought on the territory of the Southern states, the Confederate Army made some bold moves to bring the battle into the loyal states of the Union. The second invasion began in the summer of 1863. Flush from a strong victory at Chancellorsville, the Confederate Army marched into Pennsylvania. Though not fully concentrated, the General Robert E. Lee, the commander of the southern forces, launched an attack at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863. The battle was bloody on both sides: Union forces suffered 23,000 casualties, while the Confederate forces lost 28,000 men, nearly a third of the entire invading army.  The Civil War in Pennsylvania - America's LibraryThe Civil War in Pennsylvania  This is the first page of the earliest-known draft of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.  The Civil War in Pennsylvania  What was the most important battle in Pennsylvania during the Civil War?  It was the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place on July 1 through 3, 1863, in southern Pennsylvania. The battle was General Robert E. Lee's final attempt to invade the North. Even though the Union army won the battle, more than 51,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured in the bloodiest battle of the entire war.  At the dedication ceremony of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous speech, the Gettysburg Address. You may have heard the famous opening words before: \"Four score and seven years ago.\" The Gettysburg Address is a very short speech. It is less than 300 words, and it probably seemed even shorter at the time because Lincoln delivered his address after a two-hour speech by orator Edward Everett.  At one point in the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln says: \"We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" Lincoln is unclear when he talks about the soldiers who died during the Battle of Gettysburg. Perhaps he wanted Southerners to believe he was including the Confederate as well as the Union soldiers. By calling for a \"new birth of freedom\" for the nation, Lincoln may have been asking the South to rejoin the union.  page 1 of 1  The Gettysburg Address - History PlaceThe History Place - Great Speeches Collection: Abraham Lincoln - The Gettysburg Address  The Battle of Gettysburg occurred over three hot summer days, July            1 to July 3, 1863, around the small market town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

He lived in the village of Gunsbach, where his father was a local pastor . His father taught him how to play music. In 1893, Schweitzer passed his Baccalaureat .  After this, Schweitzer went to Paris to learn philosophy and music, before returning to his birthplace to study theology. He spent nine years studying medicine and surgery . He would dedicate his life to helping people and curing diseases.  Music  Schweitzer was a famous organist and was extremely interested in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach . He developed a simple style of performance, which he thought to be closer to what Bach had meant. In 1908, he completed the final version of his book \"Johann Sebastian Bach\". In the book, he argued for the new style, which has had great influence on the way Bach\u2019s music is now treated.  When Schweitzer was in Lambarene, his main recreation was to play Bach\u2019s music. He also gave musical performances to raise money for medical supplies in Gabon .  Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD . Between 1934 and 1935, he had a trial recording for HMV on the organ of the old Queen's Hall in London . In mid-December 1935, he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All-Hallows-by-the-Tower, Barking, London.  Theology and Pphilosophy  Schweitzer became well known for his books on Jesus and Christianity . He was not so much interested in the historical study of Jesus, as in the Christian idea of the end of the world, which can be found in the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. Schweitzer also served as a minister for Saint Nicholas Church in Strassburg .  In the philosophy of Albert Schweitzer, the most important idea is the respect for life. In his book \"The Philosophy of Civilization\", he wrote that \"true philosophy\" begins with the idea that:  \"I am a life that wants to live, in the midst of life that wants to live.\"  Albert Schweitzer\u2019s ethical principles meant that he tried to have a personal and spiritual relationship with the universe . It also meant that he was vegetarian .  Schweitzer in Africa  Albert Schweitzer spent most of his life in Lambarene, Africa. In 1904, he was inspired to help sick people in the world, so he studied medicine. After his medical studies in 1913, he went to Lambarene with his wife to establish a hospital that would serve thousands of Africans.  During World War I , the French made Schweitzer and his wife, both Germans, leave Africa. In 1924, he returned to Lambarene and managed to rebuild the destroyed hospital, where he served as a physician .  Later life  From 1939-1948, he stayed in Lambarene since he could not go to Europe during the war. Three years later he resumed his medical practices. But he was no longer just a medical doctor and whenever possible he went to Europe to lecture at universities. Slowly his ideas become known, not only in Europe but worldwide.  In 1952 Dr Albert Schweitzer was awarded The Nobel Prize for peace. He gave a famous speech \"The Problem of Peace\". He died on 4 September 1965 at his hospital in Lambarene.

So its name already expresses that River Aare is the Swiss river par excellence, while the other major Swiss rivers, Rhine and Rh\u00f4ne, run through peripheral regions or mark the border to neighbouring countries.  A virtual journey along River Aare  Origins of River Aare  River Aare originates in a couple of glaciers feeding storage lakes  in the Grimsel Area (south-eastern end of Bernese Oberland, north face of Bernese Alps).  The first section of river Aare from the Grimsel lakes down to Haslital  with villages Innertkirchen and Meiringen is relatively steep. Between Innertkirchen and Meiringen, river Aare has to pass the Aareschlucht, a narrow canyon with steep rock walls on both sides.  Bernese Oberland  From Meiringen on, the terrain gets relatively flat and the valley is more open. Brienz marks the upper end of Lake Brienz.  Interlaken [the originally Latin name means: between the lakes]  sits between Lake Brienz and Lake Thun and is also a gate to the first  major side valley, Lauterbrunnental with resorts Lauterbrunnen,  M\u00fcrren, Wengen and Grindelwald and the famous Bernese Oberland  mountains Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau.  On the left shore of Lake Thun Spiez is a small railway hub giving access to two side valleys Kandertal (river Kander, resorts Frutigen and Kandersteg, L\u00f6tschberg railway line and tunnel to Wallis / upper Rh\u00f4ne valley) and Simmental (river Simme with resorts Zweisimmen, Lenk im Simmental and scenic Montreux-Oberland railway line).  Thun, located at the lower end of Lake Thun, is the 10th largest city of Switzerland and economic center of the Bernese Oberland region (though geographically located at the end of the region).  Bern, Switzerland's capital and 4th largest city (or at least it's  medieval downtown nucleus) is built on a rock surrounded on three sides by a loop of river Aare.  Berner Seeland [Bernese Lake Plateau]  Biel/Bienne: Zihlkanal  River Aare used to devastate large plateau areas by inundations in past centuries. To stop this, hydraulic engineering measures were taken. Hagneck channel leads the waters to Lake Biel serving as a huge compensation basin. The old course of River Aare between the village of Aarberg and B\u00fcren a. Aare still exists, but is only a small brook nowadays. A second channel, Zihlkanal directs the waters from Lakes Neuch\u00e2tel, Murten and Biel to B\u00fcren.  Alongside the Jura mountain chain  River Aare is calm and a little lazy on the plateau with very low decline -  except near power plants, where it may become very dangerous to swimmers and canoeists. A large area between Grenchen and the city of Solothurn has been declared a nature protection zone. Wanderers and bikers are welcome as long as they don't leave the trails. Modern traffic demands a tribute, however: a Autobahn [4-lane interstate/expressway] bridge cuts the area into two.  River Aare follows the Jura mountain chain in its crescent form from southwestern to northeastern Switzerland. Olten, Aarau [once more, the river has  given its name to a city] and Brugg are the major cities and towns until River Aare unites with rivers Reuss and Limmat near Turgi and feeds Lake Klingnau a storage lake that is very popular among water fowl from  northern Europe in winter and consequently among hobby ornithologists", "truth": ["interlaken"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5292", "mistake": "Rivers Aare", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

A Heublein Corporation executive named John G. Martin spearheaded the purchase of America's only vodka distillery in the late 1930s, and in an effort to promote the unknown vodka, teamed up with Jack Morgan, owner of an L.A. restaurant called the Cock'n Bull. Morgan was trying to push ginger beer to his customers, so together they devised the Moscow Mule, a mixture of vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice, and served it in a copper mug. Thanks to them and the famous \"Smirnoff Leaves You Breathless\" ads, by 1976 vodka had surpassed gin and whiskey to become America's most popular spirit.  That this fortuitous ingredient combination succeeded demonstrates one of vodka's most appealing qualities. After the spirit is distilled (most often from grain, not, as is commonly believed, from potato), it's filtered through charcoal to remove both flavor and aroma; the resulting neutral spirit can be mixed with almost anything. Yet rampant misuse of this neutrality\u2014the substituting of vodka where flavorful, aromatic spirits belong\u2014has inspired a backlash from bartenders devoted to reviving those drinks that vodka has wrongly occupied.  The Moscow Mule, however, \"is an example of vodka done right,\" says Wondrich, at least when mixed using good, spicy ginger beer and plenty of lime.  See More Classic Cocktail Recipes:  Moscow Mule Recipe: The Great Vodka and Ginger Beer DrinkMoscow Mule Cocktail Recipe  Garnish with the lime wedge .  If you would like to go a traditional route, serve your Moscow Mule in a copper mug.  Compare Prices  The History of the Moscow Mule  There are a couple of claims to the creation of the Moscow Mule. One dates to 1939 at the Cock N' Bull pub in Hollywood. The story goes that the bar's owner, Jack Morgan, partnered up Smirnoff owner John Martin to promote that vodka along with the bar's house ginger beer.  It was a win-win situation for the team because both brands are alive and well today.  Buy Cock N' Bull Ginger Beer at Amazon  Another story jumps ahead to 1941 at the same bar when the head bartender, Wes Price, needed to unload liquor stock that wasn't selling. This successful promotion was enhanced by a marketing campaign in which a Moscow Mule made with Smirnoff was served in copper mugs. The mugs became a trademark vessel for the drink, the campaign was a success for the Russian vodka and the drink has been popular ever since.  The drink came back into the spotlight in the 21st century and often it seemed to be the talk of every bar in the world. This resurgence introduced an entirely new generation of drinkers to the great taste of the Moscow Mule, but it has also led to a few misconceptions.  The Moscow Mule and Ginger Beer: Getting the Popular Vodka Cocktail Right  Ginger Beer  The Moscow Mule is simple: vodka, lime, ginger beer. That's right, ginger beer -- not ginger ale or any of the lemon-lime sodas available.  This cocktail requires\u00a0 ginger beer .  It is a completely different drink without that single element because all of those other sodas are tame and boring compared to the snap of a great ginger beer. The ginger beer is the real appeal to the Moscow Mule; the vodka and lime are mere complements to the ginger beer and until you have one made properly, you have not experienced it completely.  I have even been in an establishment (or two) that got everything right, including the copper mugs, except that there was not a drop of ginger beer in the house.  I honestly do not mind the ginger ale option. It still makes for a great drink. That drink is not, however, a Moscow Mule.

Colorado potato beetle management on potatoes: current challenges and future prospects. In: Tennant P, Benkeblia N (Eds) Potato II. Fruit, Vegetable and Cereal Science and Biotechnology 3 (Special Issue 1): 10-19.  Available free of charge with permission of the publisher, Global Science Books Ltd.  Colorado Potato Beetle Biology and Management  References Cited  Introduction  Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa  decemlineata [Say]) is the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. It  also causes significant damage to tomato and eggplant. One beetle consumes  approximately 40 cm2 of potato leaves at a larval stage, and up to additional  9.65 cm2 of foliage per day as an adult (Ferro et al., 1985). In addition to  impressive feeding rates, Colorado potato beetle is also characterized by high  fecundity, with one female laying 300-800 eggs (Harcourt, 1971). Furthermore,  the beetle has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to virtually every  chemical that has ever been used against it.  Distribution  Since Colorado potato beetle shifted from its original wild  hosts in southwestern North America, it has spread throughout the rest of the  continent and has invaded Europe and Asia.  Currently its distribution covers about 8 million km2 in North  America (Hsiao, 1985) and about 6 million km2 in Europe and Asia  (Jolivet, 1991). It has appeared recently in western China  and Iran.  Potentially the Colorado potato beetle can occupy much larger areas in China and Asia Minor, spread to Korea, Japan,  Russian Siberia, certain areas of the Indian subcontinent, parts of North Africa, and the temperate Southern Hemisphere  (Vlasova, 1978; Worner, 1988; Jolivet, 1991).  Life History  The Colorado potato beetle has a complicated and diverse life history . The beetles overwinter in the soil as adults, with the majority  aggregating in woody areas adjacent to fields where they have spent the previous  summer (Weber and Ferro, 1993). The emergence of post-diapause beetles is more  or less synchronized with potatoes. If fields are not rotated, they are  colonized by overwintered adults that walk to the field from their  overwintering sites or emerge from the soil within the field (Voss and Ferro,  1990). If fields are rotated, the beetles are able to fly up to several  kilometers to find a new host habitat (Ferro et al., 1991; 1999). Once they  have colonized the field, the overwintered beetles first feed and then oviposit  within 5-6 days depending on temperature (Ferro et al., 1985; Ferro et al.,  1991).  Eggs are usually laid on the underside of potato leaves.  Upon hatching, larvae may move over short distances within potato canopy and  start feeding within 24 hours of eclosion. Development from the time of  oviposition to adult eclosion for pupae takes between 14-56 days (de Wilde,  1948; Walgenback and Wyman, 1984; Logan et al., 1985; Ferro et al.,  1985).\u00a0The optimal temperatures range between 25-32\u00baC and appear to differ  among populations of different geographic origins.\u00a0The larvae are capable  of behavioral thermoregulation via moving within plant canopies (May, 1981;  Lactin and Holliday, 1994), thus optimizing their body temperature compared to  the ambient temperature.\u00a0Pupation takes place in the soil near the plants  where the larval development has been completed.  Diapause is facultative, and the beetles can have between  one and three overlapping generations per year.\u00a0It takes a few days for  the newly emerged adults to develop their reproductive system and flight  muscles (Alyokhin and Ferro, 1999). After development has been completed, the  beetles mate and start laying eggs. The reproduction continues until diapause  is induced by the short-day photoperiod, then the beetles migrate to  overwintering", "truth": ["potato", "potatoes"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2187", "mistake": "potatoes", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

Related News/Archive  Review: 'Hell or High Water' is a movie with perfect Lone Star swagger  5 Months Ago  Money-grab movies are never my thing, coming from filmmakers knowing whatever viewers think when they exit the theater doesn't matter as long as they paid to get in. Movies that have no business being made in the first place, except show business as usual.  Introduced as wacky distractions in 2010's Despicable Me, these babbling yellow suppositories on legs were amusing. They were a hit, especially with small children of approximately the same balancing and linguistic skills. Their role expanded in the sequel, as did the box office take. Why not a whole movie about Minions?  Well, because even if they had shoulders, Minions can't carry a movie. They can sell one \u2014 along with fast food, electronics, insurance and Tic Tacs \u2014 but these time-release capsules of comedy don't deserve one of their own. Sidekicks seldom do, or else they wouldn't be sidekicks.  Twenty minutes, tops, in a 90 minute movie is all the Minions you need. Not coincidentally, that's just about how long it takes for these goggle-eyed thumbs to begin wearing out their welcome in this one. Comedy and narrative demand more rhythm than simply scamper, jabber, fall but that's what Minions bring to the table.  A more focused plot with better foils would help. After a prelude that would make a fine short subject, three Minions \u2014 Kevin, Stuart and Bob, all voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin \u2014 embark on a quest to find a villain to serve.  The time is 1968 B.G. (before Gru), with a classic rock soundtrack and counterculture caricatures to prove it. The period setting gives baby boomers something of interest; Abbey Road, Dating Game gags and the like to be explained on the ride home. Grandparents are pandered to with a Singin' in the Rain riff. Something for everyone buying a ticket.  Kevin, Stuart and Bob are headed to Villain Con in Orlando, which in 1968 is a bait shop by a rickety bridge, the entrance to an underground convention center. At Villain Con they connect with Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock, who will learn the benefits of overacting in animation). Scarlet is the world's only female supervillain \u2014 although her motivation and weapon tactics aren't feminist \u2014 hiring the Minions to steal Queen Elizabeth's crown.  From there, the plot goes nowhere in particular except the possibly contracted 90 minute mark, as evidence someone tried.  There are a few amusements along the way: Jon Hamm's mincing Mod accent as Scarlet's husband Herb, the occasional bits of Minion dialogue that are perceptibly multilingual, and Godzilla spoofs always work. The ending is perfect, ensuring there won't be a Minions sequel, at least.  But why did there need to be the first one? Like the Pizza Planet aliens of Toy Story and the penguins of Madagascar, Minions are more digestible in small doses, like the Twinkies they resemble.

Pinky is the sole female member of the Ghost Gang and has appeared as either an antagonist or ally throughout the franchise. In certain continuities, Pinky has been shown to have a one-sided crush on Pac-Man which normally goes unreciprocated.  While originally the main antagonist alongside Blinky , Inky and Clyde in the first Pac-Man arcade game , their role has largely been diminished to secondary antagonists or allies in recent incarnations.  Contents  History  Pac-Man  Pinky first appears alongside Blinky , Inky , and Clyde in the original arcade classic, Pac-Man . She is the second ghost to leave the chamber in the middle of the maze. Pinky's movement is very strategic. By following his direction (approximately four spaces ahead of wherever Pac-Man is headed) rather than Pac-Man himself, Pinky usually ends up taking a roundabout path to him. She tends to move counterclockwise around blocks. Because of this, however, if Pac-Man comes face-to-face with Pinky at an intersection, she will, more often than not, turn away. During \"scatter\" mode, Pinky occupies the top-left corner of the maze.  She continues a similar role in these subsequent arcade games:  Pac-Man Championship Edition DX  Pac-Land  Based on the Pac-Man animated series , Pac-Land features Pinky and the other ghosts as they try to stop Pac-Man by using various methods, including vehicles. Pinky is depicted as a male character in the American version to coincide with the Hannah-Barbera animated series which was airing at the time, as such her sprite was changed to match her American counterpart much like the rest of the characters in the game.  Pac-Man Remix  Pinky appears as a normal enemy in this game, often ambushing and trapping Pac-Man. Pinky is the second boss of the game, and she makes herself a giant, and uses a mega-hover car to fight Pac-Man with. Her hover-car flies around chasing Pac-Man, before teleporting to a random spot. These attacks are easy to avoid if the player keeps running around the sides, and she is defeated by chomping a Power Pellet , which turns her giant form into 20 small dark-blue ghosts that the player must eat to make her smaller and defeat her. When Pinky becomes normal size, she abandons her hover-car and attacks the player normally. Along with the other ghosts, she fights Pac-Man in the second-to-last battle. She makes herself giant and, if the player defeats the giant Blinky, attacks. She doesn't have her hover-car anymore, so she is unable to teleport, making her easier, but as the player must use the double Pac-Man power-up to reach the power-pellet, it is slightly harder. In the final boss battle, she pilots the mega-ghost on the castle roof alongside Blinky, Inky, and Clyde.  Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures  Pinky, Blinky, Inky, and Clyde appear as enemies for Pac-Man, petrifying him whenever they appear. Unless Pac-Man is able to get a Power Pellet , he will faint. Occasionally, Pinky or the others will leave important items behind after they are eaten. After their leader, the Ghost Witch of Netor is defeated, Pinky and the others fly off.  Pac-Man World series  Pinky in Pac-Man World 2  Pac-Man World  Pinky and the ghosts allied themselves with Orson , who plotted to defeat Pac-Man once and for all.

Photo by Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images  Lauren Bacall, the legendary actress whose husky voice was a staple of Hollywood\u2019s golden age, passed away Tuesday . Her career was wide-ranging and nuanced, with iconic moments on both the screen and the stage .  Her defining performance, though, was her first one. Bacall made her bright-eyed debut in 1944\u2019s To Have and Have Not , which paired her with an aging Humphrey Bogart. Bacall was 20 at the time, a middle-class girl from the Bronx doing part-time modeling; Bogart was 44 and at the peak of his career. Their connection was immediate, their chemistry electric.

{"input": "Question: What shape are honeycomb cells? </s> Context: Why are honeycomb cells hexagonal in shape? - QuoraWhy are honeycomb cells hexagonal in shape? - Quora  Quora  Written Jan 31, 2016  Consider the fact that the most space-efficient way to pack circles is in a hexagonal structure. Consider that in a triangle, the point [math]O[/math]\u00a0 that has the least total distance from the three vertices [math]A,B,C [/math] has angles such that [math]AOB=BOC=COA=120^\\circ[/math].  Essentially, a hexagonal structure minimizes the surface area to volume ratio. Wax is very expensive (in terms of energy) for bees to produce, so they would like to try to store as much as they can with the minimum wax possible.  Why don't they store it in spheres, then? Well, first of all, each of the compartments need to be open to the rest of the hive, so they can't surround a compartment with other compartments as that would totally defeat the purpose of the hive. Why don't they make larger hexagons instead of such tiny ones? It's the same reason that we store things in individual packages, we need to organize things by type of object, expiration date, etc.  As an aside, if you've seen what bubbles are like when they are clumped together, you will realize that the surfaces all tend to meet at angles of 120 degrees. The reasons for this are similar; one needs to minimize surface area for a given volume.  (This was all in a lecture at SMT some years ago.)  It is actually smart geometry of nature.Hexagon is the only shape which shares common boundaries with other hexagon and doesn't waste any space.Imagine if it was an all circular small chambers,there will be small gap left between them.  \u200b  \u200bOn the other hand,triangle or square can fit,but have lower surface area than hexagon.Other geometrical shapes like pentagon,heptagon,ocatgon will waste space,as like circle.This arrangement is done in account of use of wax by bees.Tomake the honey comb,bees have strategy that the small chambers should have maximum area in it,with usage of less bee's wax and minimum wastage of space.And hexagon fulfills all this.But the beauty is that bees are no engineers or architectures,still they know how to create perfect geometrical shapes without any tools.  Written Mar 12, 2016  Two possible explanations exist as to why honeycomb is composed of hexagons, rather than any other shape. First, the hexagonal tiling creates a partition with equal-sized cells, while minimizing the totalperimeter of the cells. Known in geometry as the honeycomb conjecture, this was given byJan Bro\u017cek and proved much later byThomas Hales. Thus, a hexagonal structure uses the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given volume. A second reason, given by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, is that the shape simply results from the process of individual bees putting cells together: somewhat analogous to the boundary shapes created in a field of soap bubbles. In support of this, he notes that queen cells, which are constructed singly, are irregular and lumpy with no apparent attempt at efficiency.[2]  The closed ends of the honeycomb cells are also an example of geometric efficiency, albeit three-dimensional and little-noticed. The ends are trihedral (i.e., composed of three planes) sections of rhombic dodecahedra, with the dihedral angles of all adjacent surfaces measuring 120\u00b0, the angle that minimizes surface area for a given volume. (The angle formed by the edges at the pyramidal apex, known as the tetrahedral angle, is approximately 109\u00b0 28' 16\" (= arccos(\u22121/3)).)  \u200b  The three-dimensional geometry of a honeycomb cell  The shape of the cells is such that two opposing honeycomb layers nest into each other, with each facet of the closed ends being shared by opposing cells.  \u200b  Opposing layers of honeycomb cells fit together  Individual cells do not show this geometric perfection: in a regular comb, deviations of a few percent from the \"perfect\" hexagonal shape occur.

{"input": "Question: What was the former name of the British Green Party? </s> Context: Green Party (UK)The Green Party,  also known as the Green Party UK, was a Green political party in the United Kingdom.  Prior to 1985 it was called The Ecology Party, and before that PEOPLE. In 1990, it separated into three political parties:  * the Green Party of England and Wales  * the Scottish Green Party  * the Green Party in Northern Ireland  Despite the UK Green Party no longer existing as an entity, \"Green Party\" (singular) is still used in most media to refer collectively to all of the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in Northern Ireland, for example in reporting opinion polls and election results.  People, 1973\u20131975  An interview with overpopulation expert Paul R. Ehrlich in Playboy magazine inspired a small group of professional & business people to form the 'Club of Thirteen', so named because it first met on 13 October 1972 in Daventry. This included surveyors and property agents Freda Sanders and Michael Benfield, Jitendrakumar Patel (1950-2016) and husband and wife solicitors Lesley and Tony Whittaker (a former Kenilworth councillor for the Conservative Party), all with practices in Coventry. Many in this 'club' were wary of forming a political party so, after a few weeks, in November 1972 these four agreed to form 'PEOPLE' as a new political party to challenge the UK political establishment.  Its policy concerns published in 1973 included economics, employment, defence, energy (fuel) supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, as then seen within an ecological perspective. Subsequently recognised as perhaps the world's earliest Green party this had the first edition of the Manifesto for a Sustainable Society as a background statement of policies inspired by A Blueprint for Survival (published by The Ecologist magazine). The editor of The Ecologist, Edward 'Teddy' Goldsmith, merged his 'Movement for Survival' with PEOPLE. Goldsmith became one of the leading members of the new party during the 1970s.Wall, Derek, Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party, 1994  With \"Steady State\" economics featured in the party's philosophical basis,the all-UK party became a persistent and growing presence in general elections and European elections, fielding often enough candidates to qualify for television and radio election broadcasts.  Derek Wall, in his history of the Green Party, contends that the new political movement focused initially on the theme of survival, which shaped the \"bleak evolution\" of the nascent ecological party during the 1970s. Furthermore, the effect of the \"revolution of values\" during the 1960s would come later. In Wall's eyes, the party suffered from a lack of media attention and \"opposition from many environmentalists\", which contrasted the experience of other emerging Green parties, like Germany's Die Gr\u00fcnen. Nonetheless, PEOPLE invested much of its resources in engaging with the indifferent environmental movement, which Wall calls a \"tactical mistake\".  In 1973 policy concerns included economics, employment, defence, energy (fuel) supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, as then seen within an ecological perspective.  \"Zero growth\" (or \"steady state\") economics were a strong feature in the party's philosophical basis.  Membership rose and the party contested both 1974 General Elections. In the February 1974 General Election, PEOPLE received 4,576 votes in 7 seats. Following the election, an influx of left-wing activists took PEOPLE in a more left-wing direction, causing something of a split. This affected preparations for the October 1974 General Election, where PEOPLE's average vote fell to just 0.7%.  After much internal debate the party's 1975 Conference adopted a proposal to change its name to 'The Ecology Party' in order to gain more recognition as the party of environmental concern.  Party co-founder Tony Whittaker noted in an interview with Derek Wall '\u2026 voters did not connect PEOPLE with ecology.

Close partnership working between licensed premises, Nottinghamshire Police, Broxtowe Borough Council and Pubwatch has reaped rewards to reduce anti-social behaviour and disorder in an area of Broxtowe.  In a bid to tackle incidents of violence in some public houses in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, Community Protection Warnings were issued to four offenders to advise them that their violent behaviour would not be tolerated. They were further advised that if their behaviour continued, the warnings could be followed up by Community Protection Notices which if breached could result in the issuing of a Fixed Penalty Notice or prosecution through the courts.  All four people had been barred by Stapleford Pubwatch for various anti-social behaviour and violence related issues. Through the pubs keeping their own records and where Police had attended to assist in removing these people, evidence was gained as a basis for the warnings being served.  Also, a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) was applied for on the back of a criminal charge of unlawful wounding. Scott Copson, aged 34 years was sentenced to 32 months imprisonment for this offence and breaching a suspended sentence. The CBO was given for a period of 3 years and excludes the offender from entering on-licensed premises in England or Wales. If the order is breached it becomes a criminal offence. He is currently serving this prison sentence but upon release a photograph and further update will be released.  Inspector Steve Wragg, Broxtowe Borough District Commander for Nottinghamshire Police said, \u201cThe police and local authority have worked closely with those involved in the management of the licensed premises and ensured plans have been put in place to prevent anti-social behaviour and disorder.\u201d He added, \u201cBy working in partnership,the numbers of incidents at licensed premises have reduced and as a result, Stapleford is a safer place for people to socialise.\u201d  Councillor Mia Kee, Chair of Broxtowe Borough Council\u2019s Environment and Community Safety Committee commented, \u201cThis work is an excellent demonstration of the close working relationship which exists between police and borough council officers, resulting in a very positive outcome.

{"input": "Question: Which island off Cape Cod was once the site of the world's biggest whaling port? </s> Context: Cape CodCape Cod is a geographic cape separated from the mainland by the Cape Cod Canal.  It extends into the Atlantic Ocean from the southeastern corner of mainland Massachusetts, in the northeastern United States.  Its historic, maritime character and ample beaches attract heavy tourism during the summer months.  Cape Cod stretches from Provincetown in the northeast to Woods Hole in the southwest. Cape Cod, as defined by the Cape Cod Commission's enabling legislation, comprises Barnstable County. The Cape Cod Canal cuts  roughly across the base of the peninsula, though the western boundary of the cape extends to include small portions of the towns of Bourne and Sandwich which lie on the mainland side of the canal.   Two highway bridges cross the Cape Cod Canal: the Sagamore Bridge and the Bourne Bridge. In addition, the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge carries railway freight and limited passenger services onto the Cape. Cape territory is divided into fifteen towns with many villages.  Region of Cape Cod and the Islands   Like Cape Cod itself, the islands south of the Cape have evolved from whaling and trading areas to become resort destinations, attracting wealthy families, celebrities, and other tourists.  These include the large nearby islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard which have grown in population by 6.8 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, between 2000 and 2010 while the year-round population of Barnstable County dropped 3 percent according to the Census.   Both islands are also famous summer tourist destinations, commonly accessed by ferry from several locations on the cape. The phrases Cape Cod and the Islands and the Cape and Islands are often used to describe the whole region of Barnstable County, Dukes County (including Martha's Vineyard and the smaller Elizabeth Islands), and Nantucket County.  Several small islands right off Cape Cod, including Monomoy Island, Monomoscoy Island, Popponesset Island, and Seconsett Island, are also in Barnstable County.  The Forbes family-owned Naushon Island was first purchased by John Murray Forbes. Naushon is one of the Elizabeth Islands, many of which are privately owned. One of the publicly accessible Elizabeths is the southernmost island in the chain, Cuttyhunk, with a year-round population of 52 people. Several prominent families have established compounds or estates on the larger islands, making these islands some of the wealthiest resorts in the Northeast, yet they retain much of the early merchant trading and whaling culture.  Cape Cod in particular is a popular retirement area; 27.8% of the population of Barnstable County is 65 years old or older.,  and the average age of residents is the highest of any area in New England. By voter registration numbers, Democrats outnumber Republicans by less in the three counties than in the whole of Massachusetts, to varying degrees.   The bulk of the land in the area is glacial terminal moraine and represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast New England; similar glacial formations make up Long Island in New York and Block Island in Rhode Island.  Geography and political divisions  Physical geography and boundaries  The name \"Cape Cod\", as it was first used in 1602, applied only to the very tip of the peninsula. It remained that way for 125 years, until the \"Precinct of Cape Cod\" was incorporated as the Town of Provincetown. No longer in \"official\" use over the ensuing decades, the name came to mean all of the land east of the Manomet and Scusset rivers \u2013 essentially along the line that became the Cape Cod Canal. The creation of the canal separated the majority of the peninsula from the mainland, effectively turning it into an island.  Indeed, most agencies, including the Cape Cod Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), treat the Cape as an island with regard to disaster preparedness, groundwater management, and the like.   Most \"Cape Codders\" \u2013 residents of \"The Cape\" \u2013 refer to all land on the mainland side of the canal as \"off-Cape.\" However, the legal delineation of Cape Cod, coincident to the boundaries of Barnstable County, extends to the northwest boundaries of the towns of Bourne and Sandwich \u2013", "truth": ["nantucket"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4866", "mistake": "Barnstable County", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: In which year was the ten shilling note withdrawn in the UK following the introduction of the 50p coin ? </s> Context: DECIMAL COINS - KEN ELKS HOME PAGEDECIMAL COINS  11.\u00a0DECIMAL COINS  \u00a0  During Victorian times there was movement towards the introduction of a decimal coinage. As a preliminary, the half crown ceased to be minted in 1850 and a new coin, the florin with a value of two shillings, a tenth of a pound, took its place. Nevertheless, although the idea was finally abandoned and the half crown reintroduced in 1874, the florin continued to be minted. That the idea of decimalization still lingered is shown by the introduction of the double florin, one fifth of a pound, in 1887, but this coin proved unpopular and was discontinued after four years. At the time it was known as the \"Barmaid's ruin\" because it was so easily mistaken for the crown.  In 1961 a Committee of Enquiry was set up to consider again the adoption of a decimal currency. In its report, published in 1968, it recommended a currency still based on the pound, but divided into a hundred pennies. A minority of the committee favoured a currency based on ten shillings, with each shilling worth ten pence. In the new system the florin would be retained and become ten new pence and the shilling five new pence and all new coins minted would show these values. There would be three new bronze coins with values of two, one and half new pence and a new fifty pence coin to replace the ten shilling note. The letter \"d\" to denote pence was to be replaced by \"p\", entering common parlance as \"pee\" or \"new pee\". Almost as an afterthought, the old sixpence was also retained with a value of two and a half new pence, but no more were to be minted. It eventually ceased to be legal tender in 1980. The new coinage was to become effective on 15 February 1971.  As a preliminary, the cupro-nickel florins and shillings minted from 1968 onwards showed their value in new pence. The distinctive seven-sided fifty pence coin entered circulation in October 1969 and the following year, the ten shilling note ceased to be printed though it still remained in circulation for some years afterwards. Production of all the old denominations ceased as the Royal Mint geared up in readiness for the changeover. However, in 1968, before ceasing completely, a large number of souvenir proof sets in the old currency were minted dated 1970 and specimen sets of the new coins, but dated 1971, were made available at the same time.  The introduction of decimalization in 1971 produced much confusion and anomalies. Dual pricing was allowed in order for people to adjust to the new coinage but this seemed to cause more problems than a quick changeover. Eventually a law was passed stating that all goods must be price only in new pence.  Commemorative crowns were still issued with a value of 25 new pence. These were to celebrate the Queen's 25th Wedding Anniversary in 1971, her Silver Jubilee in 1977, the Queen Mother's 80th birthday in 1980 and finally the wedding of Price Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. Thereafter, all new crowns were given a value of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd5, although the first of these did not appear until 1990. None of these coins were intended for circulation but they do have legal tender status.  The decimal coinage remained unchanged until 1982 when a new seven-sided twenty pence coin was introduced. There had been considerable demand for such a coin for several years. At the same time the word \"New\" was dropped from the value shown on the reverse of all coins as it was considered that by now there would no longer be any confusion with the old coinage. The following year, the pound note was replaced with a brass coin due to inflation, which had made the printing of the notes uneconomic (they had a relatively short life and considerable security measures and controls had to be exercised in their printing). These brass coins make an interesting collection as each year the reverse design is changed, each reverse representing one of the nations that go to make up Britain. So far there have been at least ten different reverse types used.  \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1", "truth": ["1970"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2104", "mistake": "In which year was the ten shilling note withdrawn in the UK following the introduction of the 50p coin", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

The novel's full title is, The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to Publish on Any Account).Dickens invented over 14 variations of the title for this work, see [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici  0021-8529%28198723%2946%3A1%3C7%3ATTAET%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S&size=LARGE \"Titles, Titling, and Entitlement to\"], by Hazard Adams in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Vol. 46, No. 1 (Autumn, 1987), pp. 7\u201321. It was first published as a serial in 1849\u201350, and as a book in 1850. Many elements of the novel follow events in Dickens' own life, and it is often considered as his veiled autobiography.  It was Dickens' favorite among his own novels. In the preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens wrote, \"like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.\"   Plot summary  The story follows the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, England, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years in relative happiness with his loving, childish mother and their kindly housekeeper, Peggotty. When he is seven years old his mother marries Edward Murdstone. During the marriage, partly to get him out of the way and partly because he strongly objects to the whole proceeding, David is sent to lodge with Peggotty\u2019s family in Yarmouth. Her brother, the fisherman Peggotty, lives in a houseboat with his adopted relatives Em\u2019ly and Ham, and an elderly widow, Mrs Gummidge. Little Em\u2019ly is somewhat spoilt by her fond foster father, and David is in love with her. On his return, David is given good reason to dislike his stepfather and has similar feelings for Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Between them they tyrannise over his poor mother, making her and David\u2019s lives miserable, and when in consequence David falls behind in his studies, Murdstone attempts to thrash him \u2013 partly to further pain his mother. David bites him and soon afterwards is sent away to a boarding school, Salem House, under a ruthless headmaster, Mr. Creakle. There he befriends an older boy, James Steerforth, and Tommy Traddles. He develops an impassioned admiration for Steerforth, perceiving him as something noble, who could do great things if he would.  David goes home for the holidays only to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die, and David returns home immediately. Peggotty marries the local carrier, Mr Barkis. Murdstone sends David to work for a wine merchant in London \u2013 a business of which Murdstone is a joint owner.The grim reality of hand-to-mouth factory existence echoes Dickens's own travails, in a blacking factory when he was just a boy. Copperfield's tragicomic landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is arrested for debt and sent to the King's Bench Prison, where he remains for several months, before being released and moving to Plymouth. No one remains to care for David in London, so he decides to run away.  He walks from London to Dover, where he finds his only relative, his unmarried, eccentric great-aunt Betsey Trotwood. She had come to Blunderstone at his birth, only to depart in ire upon learning that he was not a girl. However, she takes pity on him and agrees to raise him, despite Murdstone's attempt to regain custody of David, on condition that he always tries to \u2018be as like his sister, Betsy  Trotwood\u2032 as he can be, meaning that he is to endeavour to emulate the prospective namesake she was disappointed of. David's great-aunt renames him \"Trotwood Copperfield\" and addresses him as \"Trot\", and it becomes one of several names which David is called by in the course of the novel.

DJ Taylor on Alan Sillitoe's fiction | Books | The GuardianDJ Taylor on Alan Sillitoe's fiction | Books | The Guardian  Share on Messenger  Close  For an all-purpose introduction to Alan Sillitoe's half century or so as a professional writer, it would be difficult to touch \"The Match\", a short story written in the mid-1950s that first saw the light in his collection The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (1959). Set on a grim winter Saturday in Eden-era Nottingham, and taking as its catalyst a soccer match between Notts County and Bristol City, its seven or eight pages are a brisk exercise in determinism, built upon a failing and abusive marriage.  Nervy, middle-aged Lennox is watching the game with his much younger neighbour. To the newly married Fred, County's defeat is a matter for mild disappointment: he can take football or leave it. But to Lennox the result seems to symbolise all the miseries of his life. Speeding ill-temperedly home, he upends his tea on the carpet, picks a quarrel with his wife and viciously assaults her. Eventually Fred and Ruby, listening through the party wall, note that the noise in the next house has died down. After a slamming of doors and much walking to and fro outside, Mrs Lennox takes the children and leaves him \"for the last time\".  As Harry Ritchie points out in his Success Stories: Literature and the Media in England 1950-1959, contemporary critics responded to \"The Match\" and the other stories in the collection as they would have done to a piece of cinema verit\u00e9: snapshots from a world they knew nothing of - in this case the bloodied hearths of the Nottingham council terraces - whose interest was as much anthropological as literary.  Fifty years later, in a world where the working-class novel is only one among many fictional varieties, what distinguishes the story is not so much its \"realistic\" treatment of working-class life as its artistry. Some of this is to do with the psychology - Lennox's wife, for example, reproaching her husband in a way that she knows will drive him to fury. Quite as much, though, hangs on the lurking sense of prefiguration. Not only does the reader anticipate Lennox's destiny from the moment he opens his mouth: he is also encouraged to connect it to an endless cycle of working-class lives ruined by bad temper and failure to communicate. The brief description of Fred's 19-year-old wife hammers this inference home. \"Plump like a pear, not round like a pudding, already pregnant though they'd only been married a month\", Ruby is clearly Mrs Lennox in embryo, needing only a couple of decades", "truth": ["saturday night and sunday morning"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4867", "mistake": "Being Arthur", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

The duo rank the success just behind Costantino Rocca\u2019s runner-up finish at The Open in 1995 and back-to-back Ryder Cup wins in the history of the sport in the football-mad nation.  In 2005 Edoardo became the first European to win the US Amateur Championship since 1911 before Francesco became the first Italian to win the National Open in 26 years a year later.  \u201cIt feels good. We just had to hang in there and try to finish it up in the last few holes,\u201d said Francesco, 27. \u201cWe were lucky to hole a couple of good putts which kept us in front. We played great golf all week and it feels amazing.\u201d  For Edoardo the triumph caps a spectacular year in which he ensured an instant return to the European Tour after  setting a Challenge Tour earnings record. He also won the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan the week before heading to China.  \u201cTo win by one shot against some really good teams is a great feeling,\u201d said Edoardo, 28. \u201cAll of the players in the other teams were Ryder Cup players.\u201d  Three consecutive birdie putts from Francesco at the start of the back nine were the key as Irish duo Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell let slip a three-shot lead. Ireland had led for more than three rounds over the Olazabal course at Mission hills Golf Club at Shenzhen but failed to fire on the final day.  After Francesco had scrambled from the greenside bunker at the last to secure a par for Italy, McDowell missed a birdie chance by inches which would have earned a play-off for the Irish.  \u201cWe both played pretty averagely,\u201d said world No10 McIlroy.

Francesco, already assured of his place on Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team, led after the third round at Gleneagles while Edoardo, who is hoping to convince the European captain Colin Montgomerie to include him as a wild card, trailed by one stroke. They will play together in Sunday\u2019s final round after Francesco posted a four-under 68 for a 10-under 206. Another victory for Edoardo would make it difficult for Montgomerie not to choose him as one of his three wild cards later Sunday.

As an agent of MI6, Bond holds code number \"007\". The 'double-O' prefix indicates his discretionary licence to kill in the performance of his duties.  Irish actor Pierce Brosnan held the role from 1995 to 2004. He appeared in GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Die Another Day (2002). In addition he also provided his likeness for six James Bond video games , starting with Rareware's 1997 blockbuster\u00a0 GoldenEye 007 . Although he didn't voice the character until\u00a0 Everything or Nothing , his last appearance as 007, several actors have lent their voices to Brosnan's Bond, including Adam Blackwood in Tomorrow Never Dies (1999), Timothy Bentinck in The World Is Not Enough (2000) [2] and later\u00a0 Maxwell Caulfield in Nightfire (2002).  Contents  Film biography  Shared background  Although very little of Bond's past is directly addressed in Pierce Brosnan's films, it is assumed that his Bond continues to share the common background laid out by the Ian Fleming novels and preceding Bond films.  In the novels, James Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, from the Canton de Vaud. He acquired a first-class command of the French and German languages during his early education, which he received entirely abroad. Both parents were tragically killed during a climbing accident in the French Alps which was revealed in GoldenEye .  \"We're both orphans, James. But where your parents had the luxury of dying in a climbing accident, mine survived the British betrayal and Stalin's execution squads.\"  \u2015 Alec Trevelyan ( Sean Bean ) [src]  After the death of his parents, Bond goes to live with his aunt, Miss Charmian Bond, where he completes his early education. Later, he briefly attends Eton College at \"12 or thereabouts\", but is removed after two halves because of girl trouble with a maid. After being sent down from Eton, Bond was sent to Fettes College in Scotland, his father's school. [3]  Bond and Jinx meet in Cuba  After leaving Fettes, earlier EON films note that Bond studied at Cambridge University. [4] [5] There, he achieved a first in Oriental languages. [6] In Fleming's novels, Bond alluded to briefly attending the University of Geneva (as did Fleming), before being taught to ski in Kitzb\u00fchel. [7] Following his graduation, Bond joined the Ministry of Defence and became a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves, rising though the ranks to commander. Bond applied to M for a position within the \" Secret Service \", part of the Civil Service, and rose to the rank of principal officer.  \"I think you're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War.\"  \u2015 M to James Bond in Goldeneye.  In 1986, Bond and Alec Trevelyan , agent 006, infiltrate an illicit Soviet chemical weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes from the facility as it explodes.

Her highness and the stubby breed have always gone together like crumpets and tea, but it appears their relationship is coming to an end. After owning corgis for most of her life, the Queen, 88, has declared that she will not take on anymore pets, reports the Washington Post .  Queen Elizabeth\u2019s ban on accumulating more animals began when she recently turned down two Norfolk terriers offered to her by granddaughter Princess Beatrice as a gift, and now it\u2019s extending to corgis as well.  \u201cThe fact is she worries about too many dogs around her feet and the danger she will trip up and hurt herself badly,\u201d an unidentified member of the royal court told the Express .  \u201cHer corgis are getting on a bit and move along at a sedate speed but a young dog would obviously be very lively and much more active. Her main fear is that if she fell and broke her arm or even a leg she would not be able to perform her duties for many weeks if not months, and that would upset her greatly.\u201d  Her majesty currently owns two corgis, Willow and Holly, who shot to international fame in 2012 when they were included in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.  Throughout her life, the queen has cared for more than 30 corgis, starting as a young girl when her father, King George VI, brought home one of the dogs from a local kennel in 1933 , naming him Dookie.  From there, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s fondness for the breed continued to grow. For her 18th birthday, she received her own pup named Susan. Susan went on to accompany the queen on her honeymoon.  Keeping with tradition, Her Majesty introduced the breed to her own family. A corgi named Sugar served as the nursery pet of Prince Charles and Princess Anne.  Even after the kids grew up, she kept bringing in new dogs. Queen Elizabeth has owned as many as eight corgis at once and, up until recently, was caring for five corgis, five cocker spaniels and four dachshund-corgi crossbreeds.  Now, it appears all those pups are catching up with the queen. According to Express, Her Highness does not plan on replacing her corgis or other pets after they pass.  Sounds like it\u2019s now Prince William \u2019s job to carry on the corgi reign. No offense, Lupo .  Like us on Facebook for more stories like this!

Custom molded rubber materials serve a variety of purposes, and can often mean the difference between life and death. Rubber respiratory safety masks for instance, need to be made 100% to specifications and be non-defective to properly function and withstand exposure to toxic chemicals and airborne contaminants. Advanced Rubber Products fully understands the importance of our customers\u2019 rubber needs. Our team takes full responsibility for product reliability. For example, a polymer insulator , which costs less than $100 per unit, is designed to blow up and save a $15,000 transformer from destructing. If the rubber component fails to do its job correctly, the costs quickly grow.  Rubber is not only a cost effective means of protecting the most valuable parts of your business, it\u2019s also one of the most pliable and durable materials. However, in the process of custom rubber molding, excess material is inevitable. With some smaller and more oddly shaped parts, it can be even more difficult to remove this excess material. Advanced Rubber Products uses the highly effective and precise process of cryogenic deflashing to remove unwanted or unnecessary rubber from custom molded components. The molded pieces are placed inside a chamber with a temperature of minus 60\u00b0F, making the excess material extremely brittle. The part is then bombarded with tiny pellets, removing all the excess rubber flash.  ARP understands the importance of your products and realizes that if an unexpected event occurs (i.e. extreme weather), you may need a large amount of custom rubber products in a short amount of time. This is why we maintain a well-organized warehouse with extra on-demand products. So if your business requires a large rush order, Advanced Rubber Products is able to fulfill your request at a moment\u2019s notice. We will store your extra parts so you don\u2019t have to.

It is a giant stratovolcano that began forming about a million years ago and is composed of many layers of hardened volcanic ash, lava, pumice and tephra \u2014 fragmental material that is the fallout from a volcanic eruption.  One of the Seven Summits (the highest peaks on the seven continents), Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania in east Africa.  Credit: Graeme Shannon shutterstock  A number of theories exist about the meaning and origin of the name. One theory is that the name is a mix of the Swahili word Kilima, meaning \"mountain,\" and the KiChagga word Njaro, loosely translated as \"whiteness.\" Another is that Kilimanjaro is the European pronunciation of a KiChagga phrase meaning \"we failed to climb it.\"  One of the Seven Summits (the highest peaks on the seven continents), Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania in east Africa. Kilimanjaro lies within the 292-square-mile (756 square kilometers) Kilimanjaro National Park. Kilimanjaro rises from its base approximately 16,732 feet (5,100 meters) from the plains near the Tanzanian municipality of Moshi, making it the tallest free-standing mountain in the world.  There are three volcanic cones that make up Kilimanjaro: Kibo is the summit; Mawenzi at 16,893 feet (5,149 meters); and Shira at 13,000 feet (3,962 meters). Uhuru Peak is the highest summit on Kibo's crater rim. Uhuru, Swahili for \"Freedom,\" was named in 1961 when Tanganyika gained its independence .

{"input": "Question: Celandine, topaz and gamboge are shades of which colour? </s> Context: TopazTopaz is a silicate mineral of aluminium and fluorine with the chemical formula Al2SiO4(F,OH)2. Topaz crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, and its crystals are mostly prismatic terminated by pyramidal and other faces.  Color and varieties  Pure topaz is colorless and transparent but is usually tinted by impurities; typical topaz is wine red, yellow, pale gray, reddish-orange, or blue brown. It can also be white, pale green, blue, gold, pink (rare), reddish-yellow or opaque to transparent/translucent.  Orange topaz, also known as precious topaz, is the traditional November birthstone, the symbol of friendship, and the state gemstone of the US state of Utah.   Imperial topaz is yellow, pink (rare, if natural) or pink-orange. Brazilian Imperial Topaz can often have a bright yellow to deep golden brown hue, sometimes even violet. Many brown or pale topazes are treated to make them bright yellow, gold, pink or violet colored. Some imperial topaz stones can fade on exposure to sunlight for an extended period of time. [http://academic.emporia.edu/abersusa/go340/topaz.htm Gemstones & Gemology \u2013 Topaz], Emporia State University  Blue topaz is the state gemstone of the US state of Texas.   Naturally occurring blue topaz is quite rare. Typically, colorless, gray or pale yellow and blue material is heat treated and irradiated to produce a more desired darker blue.  Mystic topaz is colorless topaz which has been artificially coated giving it the desired rainbow effect.   Localities and occurrence  Topaz is commonly associated with silicic igneous rocks of the granite and rhyolite type.  It typically crystallizes in granitic pegmatites or in vapor cavities in rhyolite lava flows including those at Topaz Mountain in western Utah and Chivinar in South America. It can be found with fluorite and cassiterite in various areas including the Ural and Ilmen mountains of Russia, in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Pakistan, Italy, Sweden, Japan, Brazil, Mexico; Flinders Island, Australia; Nigeria and the United States.  Some clear topaz crystals from Brazilian pegmatites can reach boulder size and weigh hundreds of pounds. Crystals of this size may be seen in museum collections. The Topaz of Aurangzeb, observed by Jean Baptiste Tavernier weighed 157.75 carats.   The American Golden Topaz, a more recent gem, weighed a massive 22,892.5 carats.  Colorless and light-blue varieties of topaz are found in Precambrian granite in Mason County, Texas  within the Llano Uplift. There is no commercial mining of topaz in that area.

File:Topaz-2.jpg|Colorless topaz, Minas Gerais, Brazil  Etymology  The name \"topaz\" is usually derived (via Old French: Topace and Latin: Topazus) from the Greek \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\u03a4\u03bfp\u00e1zi\u03bfs) or \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\u03a4\u03bfp\u00e1zi\u03bfn),  from \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03c2, the ancient name of St. John's Island in the Red Sea which was difficult to find and from which a yellow stone (now believed to be chrysolite: yellowish olivine) was mined in ancient times; topaz itself (rather than topazios) was not really known before the classical era.  Pliny said that Topazos is a legendary island in the Red Sea and the mineral \"topaz\" was first mined there. Alternatively, the word topaz may be related to the Sanskrit word \u0924\u092a\u0938\u094d \"tapas\", meaning \"heat\" or \"fire\".  Historical usage  Nicols, the author of one of the first systematic treatises on minerals and gemstones, dedicated two chapters to the topic in 1652.  In the Middle Ages, the name topaz was used to refer to any yellow gemstone, but in modern times it denotes only the silicate described above.  Many modern English translations of the Bible, including the King James Version mention topaz.  However, because these translations as topaz all derive from the Septuagint translation topazi[os], which as mentioned above referred to a yellow stone that was not topaz, but probably chrysolite (chrysoberyl or peridot), it should be borne in mind that topaz is likely not meant here.", "truth": ["yellow"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1416", "mistake": "The name \"topaz\" is usually derived (via Old French: Topace and Latin: Topazus) from the Greek \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

Today marks the 150th birthday of London Underground, and the system we all call the Tube.  But when the service first launched on January 9 1863, it was called the Metropolitan Railway.  Its steam trains transported Londoners between Paddington Station and Farringdon Street. Within months of the ribbon being snipped, it was carrying 26,000 passengers a day.  Twopenny Tube  By 1900, it had been upgraded to electricity, and in July that year The Central London Railway \u2013 known today as the Central Line \u2013 was opened.

The London Underground is a metro system serving a large part of Greater London and neighbouring areas of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire in England. It is both the world's oldest underground railway and the oldest rapid transit system. It was also the first underground railway to operate electric trains. It is usually referred to as the Underground or the Tube - the latter deriving from the shape of the system's deep-bore tunnels - although about 55% of the network is above ground.  The earlier lines of the present London Underground network, which were built by various private companies, became part of an integrated transport system (which excluded the main line railways) in 1933 with the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), more commonly known by its shortened name: \"London Transport\". The underground network became a single entity when London Underground Limited (LUL) was formed by the UK government in 1985. Since 2003 LUL has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL), the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, which is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London .  The Underground has 275 stations and approximately 400 km (250 miles) of track, making it the longest metro system in the world by route length, and one of the most served in terms of stations. In 2007, over one billion passenger journeys were recorded.  Contents  History Of London Underground-0  History Of London Underground. Documentary about the history of the London Underground.  Railway construction in the United Kingdom began in the early 19th century. By 1854 six separate railway terminals had been built just outside the centre of London: London Bridge, Euston, Paddington, King's Cross, Bishopsgate and Waterloo. At this point, only Fenchurch Street Station was located in the actual City of London. Traffic congestion in the city and the surrounding areas had increased significantly in this period, partly due to the need for rail travellers to complete their journeys into the city centre by road. The idea of building an underground railway to link the City of London with the mainline terminals had first been proposed in the 1830s, but it was not until the 1850s that the idea was taken seriously as a solution to the traffic congestion problems.  The first underground railways  Edit  In 1854 an Act of Parliament was passed approving the construction of an underground railway between Paddington Station and Farringdon Street via King's Cross which was to be called the Metropolitan Railway. The Great Western Railway (GWR) gave financial backing to the project when it was agreed that a junction would be built linking the underground railway with their mainline terminus at Paddington. GWR also agreed to design special trains for the new subterranean railway.  Construction was delayed for several years due to a shortage of funds.

{"input": "Question: Wicket-keeper Matt Prior, currently part of the England team plays for which county? </s> Context: Matt PriorMatthew James \"Matt\" Prior (born 26 February 1982) is a retired English cricketer who played for England in Test cricket and for Sussex in domestic cricket. He was a wicket-keeper, and his aggressive right-handed batting enabled him to open the innings in ODI matches, even when he made very limited appearance in shorter forms of the game. With an international Test debut score of 126, Prior became the first English wicket-keeper to hit a century in his debut match in early 2007. His glovework, however, was criticised. Despite a successful tour of Sri Lanka with the bat, Prior's keeping was less successful, and he was dropped from the team for the 2008 tour of New Zealand. He returned for the 2008 series against South Africa, and was retained into 2009, where he became the second-fastest England keeper to reach 1,000 Test runs, behind Les Ames. In his role as wicketkeeper, Prior has been described as 'a big talker behind the stumps' but has argued that this approach is different from the behaviour that saw him criticised during the 2007 tour by India; 'Ninety-five percent of the time, my chat is about geeing up our bowlers and the fielding unit.' He retired in June 2015 from all forms of professional cricket due to a recurring Achilles tendon injury.   Early and personal life  Prior was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and moved to England with his family aged 11. His mother is South African and his father is English.   Prior attended Brighton College during which time he began playing for Sussex County Cricket Club. During his early years he played his colts cricket at St Matthias CC. From an early age Prior showed commitment to charitable causes and has never shied away from taking part in matches and events in the name of charity. He is married to Emily, the daughter of former footballer Sammy Nelson who played for Arsenal F.C. and Brighton & Hove Albion. The Priors have a son named Jonathan who was born early 2009 and a daughter born on 27 June 2015.  Prior has said he has a \"huge passion\" for cycling, and was criticised by former England team-mate Kevin Pietersen for taking his bike with him on an England tour of New Zealand.  Prior is the co-owner and chief executive of One Pro Cycling, with the cycling team racing at the UCI Continental level in 2015, and were promoted to the second-tier Professional Continental level for 2016.   Domestic career  Prior received the NBC Denis Compton Award for young cricketers three times in his career. He has hit more than 1,000 first class runs over the course of two seasons, in 2003 when he won the County Championship with Sussex, and 2004, when his 1,158 runs, including 201 not out against Loughborough UCCE, was enough to be top-scorer for Sussex that season. In 2005 he made fewer runs, with 874, but also became Sussex's first choice wicket-keeper again after having shared duties with Tim Ambrose in the two previous seasons. He has won the County Championship three times (2003, 2006 and 2007) although in 2007 he did not take part as much as before due to his England duties. It was while playing against Shane Warne that Prior acquired the nickname of 'watermelons', after Warne mimicked Prior's walk to the crease, with 'his arms out as if he were carrying a watermelon under each arm'.  England career  2004\u20132006 Zimbabwe, Pakistan and India  Prior made his One Day International debut in England's one-day series against Zimbabwe in 2004: he was chosen to open with Ian Bell and made 35 before he was dismissed by Ed Rainsford in a 74-run win.  Prior was next selected in the England team a year later for the ODI series against Pakistan. In the opening match of the series he made 45 while opening the batting as England won the match by 42 runs.

According to actor Robert Lindsa y, Wolfie Smith - the \u201curban guerrilla\u201d who made us laugh in the 1970s - is on the political comeback trail and there are plans to revive the classic sitcom Citizen Smith.  Created by the late great sitcom writer John Sullivan, Citizen Smith aired for four series between 1977 and 1980 and starred Lindsay as Wolfie, a young Marxist who was the self-appointed leader of the revolutionary Tooting Popular Front.  But how much do you remember about the classic sitcom? Here are 9 surprising facts about the series.  1. John Sullivan would go on to become a sure-fire comedy hitmaker for the BBC, but in the 1970s he was working as a scene shifter for the BBC.  He had to pester Dennis Wilson at look at the script he\u2019d written for the show, which he wrote in reaction to what he considered the stale sitcoms on air at the time.  2. BBC Head of Comedy John Howard Davies said that the show was the first script he had ever read which was ready to start filming straight away.  3. Playing a left wing revolutionary wasn\u2019t a huge jump for Lindsay, who has working-class northern roots and a staunch trade unionist father.  4. In a move that Wolfie Smith would have been proud of, Lindsay once declined the offer of dinner with Margaret Thatcher after she saw him perform as Henry II in the theatre  \u201cThere was a knock and there was Mrs Thatcher, as she was then, asking why I\u2019d turned her down,\" revealed Lindsay.  \u201cI said it was because of her politics and she said: \u2018Well, that doesn\u2019t affect your appetite, does it?\u2019 I said it did, but I was terribly intimidated.\u201d  5. The second episode of series three was titled Only Fools and Horses. John Sullivan would go on to find a handy use for that title later on in his writing career.", "truth": ["wolfie smith", "citizen smith", "tooting popular front"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6928", "mistake": "how much do you remember", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: Who supposedly chopped down a cherry tree, but couldn't lie about it? </s> Context: Which Cherry Tree Did Washington Chop? - latimesWhich Cherry Tree Did Washington Chop? - latimes  Which Cherry Tree Did Washington Chop?  February 10, 2001 |From ASSOCIATED PRESS  George Washington's birthday (Feb. 22) is a proper time to think about cherry trees. According to legend, the young president-to-be cut down a cherry tree, then admitted the act to his father because he couldn't tell a lie. Rather than question the historical truth of the story, though, let's question just what kind of cherry tree was involved.  Sweet cherry trees were among those ordered from Europe by the Massachusetts colony in 1629. Plantings spread, and trees became so abundant that in 1749, naturalist Peter Kalm wrote that \"all travellers are allowed to pluck ripe fruit in any garden which they pass by, provided they do not break any branches.\" Perhaps Washington planted a few sweet cherry trees at his farmstead along the shores of the Rappahannock River.  The felled tree also might have been a tart cherry. Although native to Europe's Caucasus Mountains, colonists in Massachusetts planted them. The tree might have made its way in the nursery trade south to Virginia a hundred years later.  One thing is certain: the famous cherry tree could not have been one of the ornamental types commonly planted these days. These non-fruit-bearing cherries originated in the Orient and were introduced into America beginning in the 19th century. The most famous is the Yoshino cherry, which fringes the tidal basin in Washington. Others include the Higan cherry, the Sargent cherry, and, the most widely planted today, the Japanese flowering cherry.  Besides exotic introductions, the eastern U.S. seaboard abounded with wild cherries in Washington's time, as it does today. Our native pin cherry is not much more than a bush, so it hardly would have a trunk worthy of legend. Washington's father would not have minded his cutting down a chokecherry either, because the tree is small and has unpalatable fruit.  Colonists did eat the fruit of our native black cherry or, more often, concoct it with rum from the West Indies to make a cherry liqueur. But the best part of the black cherry is its wood, a hardwood, which with some sanding and then oil or varnish, takes on a finish that is soft brown with a hint of red.  Now, just suppose George Washington had chopped down one of the black cherry trees. Rather than performing an act of mischief, our future president might have had some loftier purpose in mind.  (The story, incidentally, was recorded by Mason Locke Weems in his early 19th-century book about the life of George Washington.)  MORE:  Did Washington Cut Down a Cherry Tree? | eHowDid Washington Cut Down a Cherry Tree? | eHow  Did Washington Cut Down a Cherry Tree?  Jupiterimages/Comstock/Getty Images  Many myths surround the first United States president. Some ponder if George Washington wore a wig, while others question if he really tossed a silver dollar across the Potomac River. Perhaps the most famous of all is whether Washington cut down a cherry tree.  The Myth  This classic story of honesty in American history is about a young George Washington who, after receiving a hatchet as a gift from his father, cuts down many things, including a budding cherry tree. When confronted by his father, the younger Washington confesses, making his father proud.  Young Washington supposedly used a new hatchet to cut down a cherry tree.  The Truth  The story of George Washington cutting down a cherry tree is only a myth. The false story first appeared in an 1800 biography, \"A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits, of General George Washington\" by Mason Locke Weems. Weems invented several anecdotes about Washington's life to make him appear heroic.  Significance  The myth wasn't debunked for nearly a century, so many early textbooks contained the story, including the McGuffey Reader. These widespread teachings likely sealed the story as a true event in presidential history.

{"input": "Question: In 2006 Orhan Pamuk became the first Nobel Laureate from which country, when he won the literature prize? </s> Context: Turkish Writer Orhan Pamuk Wins 2006 Nobel Literature PrizeTurkish Writer Orhan Pamuk Wins 2006 Nobel Literature Prize | Fox News  Turkish Writer Orhan Pamuk Wins 2006 Nobel Literature Prize  Published               October 12, 2006  Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print  NEW YORK \u2013 \u00a0Novelist Orhan Pamuk , an international symbol of literary and social conscience, whose poetic, melancholy journeys into the soul of his native Turkey have brought him the many blessings and burdens of public life, won the Nobel literature prize Thursday.  Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as \"a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent.\"  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  \"They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy,\" said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for \"insulting Turkishness\" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country's involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria's conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include \"Snow\" and \"My Name Is Red,\" was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  \"Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it,\" he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  \"I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey,\" historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country's darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany's Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  \"I have so much respect for Faulkner,\" Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. \"What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that.\"  \"Snow,\" a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk's works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can't wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read \"Snow,\" Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, \"felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf.\"  He has spoken up for others in peril. Pamuk was the first Muslim writer to defend Salman Rushdie when Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned", "truth": ["turkey"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6721", "mistake": "Turkey", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

At an early age, Oscar was able to meet many famous British individuals. In June 1855, the Wilde's moved to 1 Merrion Square. While there, his mother held sessions with guests that included Samuel Ferguson, George Petrie and many other famous individuals.  Oscar Wilde received his education at home until the age of nine when he attended Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Fermanagh until 1871. After leaving Portora, Wilde continued his studies at Trinity College, Dublin for the next three years. Wilde was an excellent student receiving the highest award, Berkeley Gold Medal and then receiving a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford where he would study from 1874 to 1878. At Magdalen he did much the same, winning the 1878 Oxford Newdigate Prize for his poem Ravenna. Wilde graduated with a double first.  After Wilde graduatd, he fell in love with Florence Balcome. However, their relationship failed when she became engaged to Bram Stoker. After hearing of her engagement, Wilde wrote Balcome and proclaimed that he would leave Ireland permanently. His next six years were spent in London, Paris, and the United States. He later returned to his home country only twice for brief visits.  During Wilde's stint in London, he met the daughter of a wealthy QC, Constance Lloyd, and began courting her. She visited Dublin in 1884 when Wilde was giving lectures at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her and became married on May 29, 1884 in Paddington, London. With Constance's allowance of \u00a3250, the two lived in relative luxury.  The couple had two sons, Cyril in 1885 and Vyvyan in 1886. After Wilde's imprisonment for gross indecency he was sentenced to two years of hard labor on May 25, 1895. Due to this, Constance changed her and her sons names to Holland. She died in 1898 following a spinal surgery and was buried in Staglieno Cemetary in Genoa, Italy. Wilde's first born son later died in France during WWI. His other son, Vyvyan, became a translator and author. Vyvyan published his memoir in 1954.  After Wilde's release from prison on May 19, 1897, he spent much of his remaining years near bankruptcy. He took up the pen-name Sebastian Melmoth, the central character of Melmoth the Wanderer, and wrote one of his finest works, The Ballad of Reading Gaol.  Wilde's last words were reportedly \"My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One or the other of us has got to go.\" He spent his remaining days at the Hotel d'Alsace in Paris and being converted to Catholicism.  Oscar Wilde died on November 30, 1900 due to cerebral meningitis. He was buried at the Cimeti\u00e8re de Bagneux outside Paris but was later moved to Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

{"input": "Question: What story introduced the Cybermen? </s> Context: Cybermen - Everything2.comCybermen - Everything2.com  Cybermen  by mitcharf  Thu Sep 05 2002 at 20:27:47  The cybermen are androids who are the second best known nemeses of Doctor Who , after the daleks .  They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They've threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn't a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like \"real\" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.  The cybermen had cameo appearances in a number of episodes, but they made major appearances in the following:  Tue Feb 25 2003 at 14:15:41  'Imagine that you can live forever and life is totally free from pain.  You can see all things with clarity, unblinkered by irrelevant details.  You will never fear, never sicken, never lose control.

President George Bush responded in stronger terms than anyone had expected.

The pass connects K\u0101bul with Pesh\u0101war . The pass has historically been the gateway for invasions of the Indian subcontinent from the northwest. The name Khyber is also applied to the range of arid, broken hills through which the pass runs and which form the last spurs of the Spin Ghar (Saf\u012bd K\u016bh) Range. On either side of the connecting ridge are the sources of two small streams, the beds of which form the Khyber gorge. This narrow gorge forms the Khyber Pass; it winds between cliffs of shale and limestone, 600\u20131,000 feet (180\u2013300 m) high, and enters the Khyber Hills from the Shadi Bagi\u0101r opening, a few miles beyond Jamr\u016bd , Pak., and continues northwestward for about 33 miles (53 km). Just beyond the old Afghan fort of Haft Ch\u0101h, it opens onto the barren Lowyah Dakkah plain, which stretches to the K\u0101bul River .  Khyber Pass, Pakistan  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.  After a steep ascent at its southern entrance, the pass rises gradually to Fort Ali Masjid (3,174 feet), where the Khyber River (Khyber Khw\u0101r) leaves the pass to the south. For 5 miles from Ali Masjid the pass becomes a defile not more than 600 feet wide, flanked by imposing and precipitous walls. From Z\u012bntara village on northward, the pass becomes a valley a mile or more wide, with forts, villages, and scattered cultivation plots. About 10 miles west of Ali Masjid lies Landi Kotal fort and cantonment (3,518 feet); this is the highest point in the pass and is also an important market centre with an alternate route back to Pesh\u0101war. There the summit widens out northward for 2 miles. The main pass, however, descends from Landi Kotal through Shinw\u0101r\u012b territory to Landi Kh\u0101na, where it runs through another gorge and enters Afghanistan territory at Towr Kham (Torkham; 2,300 feet), winding another 10 miles down the valley to Lowyah Dakkah.  Similar Topics  Jelep Pass  The Khyber Pass is threaded by a caravan track and by a good hard-surface road. The railway (opened 1925) through the pass connects Jamr\u016bd with Landi Kh\u0101na, near the Afghan frontier; the line, with its 34 tunnels and 94 bridges and culverts, revolutionized transportation in the area. The pass may be skirted by a road fork that enters the hills about 9 miles north of Jamr\u016bd and emerges at Lowyah Dakkah.  Few passes have had such continuing strategic importance or so many historic associations as the Khyber Pass. Through it have passed Persians, Greeks, Mughals, Afghans, and the British, for whom it was the key point in control of the Afghan border. In the 5th century bc Darius I the Great of Persia conquered the country around K\u0101bul and marched through the Khyber Pass to the Indus River . Two centuries later Hephaestion and Perdiccas, generals of Alexander the Great , probably used the pass. Buddhism flourished in and around the Khyber when it was part of A\u015boka\u2019s kingdom (3rd century bc); Buddhist remains include K\u0101fir Kot (Citadel of the Kafirs), Shopla st\u016bpa (also called the Khyber Top), and the st\u016bpa near Ali Masjid. The pass was used by Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Ghazna , B\u0101bur, N\u0101der Sh\u0101h , and A\u1e25mad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101n\u012b and his grandson Sh\u0101h Zam\u0101n in their invasions of India. Ranjit Singh , the Sikh ruler of the Punjab, extended his kingdom as far as Jamr\u016bd in the early 19th century.  The Pashtun Afr\u012bd\u012b people of the Khyber area always resisted foreign control, and numerous punitive expeditions were undertaken against them by the Mughals and the British. The first British advance northward into the Khyber took place in 1839, and during the First Anglo-Afghan War the pass was the scene of many skirmishes with the Afridis.

When we bought our block at Icy Creek five years ago, the paddocks were two metres high with\u00a0these prickly pests of plants, and we\u2019re still fighting to keep them at bay. But\u00a0the Thornless Blackberry plant I bought at a nursery will not, I\u2019m assured,\u00a0take hold of the region. And if only grows as half as well as its wild cousins we should\u00a0have enough fruit for blackberry icecream next summer. That\u2019s providing we don\u2019t pull them out by accident.  Our other newcomer, the Thornless Youngberry \u00a0is a domesticated version of a berry that was itself first cultivated in the US in 1905.

It stars Carry On regulars Sid James , Kenneth Williams , Charles Hawtrey , Joan Sims , Bernard Bresslaw and Peter Butterworth . Roy Castle makes his only Carry On appearance in the \"romantic male lead\" part usually played by Jim Dale . Angela Douglas makes her fourth and final appearance in the series. Terry Scott returned to the series after his minor role in the first film of the series, Carry On Sergeant a decade earlier. The film is, in part, a spoof of \" Kiplingesque \" movies and television series about life in the British Empire , both contemporary and from earlier, Hollywood, periods.  Contents  Edit  Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond ( Sid James ) is Queen Victoria 's Governor in the British India province of Khalabar near the Khyber Pass . The province is defended by the feared 3rd Foot and Mouth Regiment (The Devils in Skirts) , who are said to not wear anything under their kilts . When Private Widdle ( Charles Hawtrey ) is found wearing underpants after an encounter with Bungdit Din ( Bernard Bresslaw ), chief of the warlike Burpa tribe, the Khasi of Khalabar ( Kenneth Williams ) plans to use this information to incite an anti-British rebellion . He aims to dispel the \"tough\" image of the Devils in Skirts by revealing that contrary to popular belief, they do indeed wear underpants under their kilts.  A diplomatic operation ensues on the part of the British, who fail spectacularly to prove that the incident was an aberration. The Governor's wife ( Joan Sims ), in the hope of luring the Khasi into bed with her, takes a photograph of an inspection in which many of the soldiers present are found wearing underpants , and takes it to him. With this hard evidence in hand, the Khasi would be able to muster a ferocious Afghan invasion force, storm the Khyber Pass and reclaim India from British rule; but Lady Ruff-Diamond insists that he sleep with her before she parts with the photograph. He delays on account of her unattractiveness, eventually taking her away with him to Bungdit Din's palace.  Meanwhile, the Khasi's daughter, Princess Jelhi ( Angela Douglas ), reveals to the British Captain Keene ( Roy Castle ), with whom she has fallen in love, that the Governor's wife has eloped, and a team is dispatched to return her and the photo to British hands. Disguised as Afghan generals, the interlopers are unmasked amid a farcical orgy scene, imprisoned, and scheduled to be executed at sunset along with the Governor's wife. The Khasi's daughter aids their escape in disguise, but Lady Ruff-Diamond drops the photograph on leaving the palace. The group return to the Khyber Pass to find its guards massacred and their weapons comically mutilated, in a rare moment of (albeit tainted) poignancy. All attempts to hold off the advancing hordes fail miserably, and a hasty retreat is beaten to the Governor's Palace.  The Governor, meanwhile, has been entertaining, in numerical order, the Khasi's fifty-one wives, each one of them wishing to \"right the wrong\" that his own wife and the Khasi himself have supposedly committed against him (though no such wrong took place). After a browbeating from his wife, Sir Sidney calls a crisis meeting regarding the invasion, in which he resolves to \"do nothing\". A black tie dinner is arranged for that evening.  Dinner takes place during a prolonged penultimate scene, in which contrapuntal snippets of the Khasi's army demolishing the Palace exterior, and the officers and ladies ignoring the devastation as they dine. Shells shaking the building and plaster falling in the soup should not interrupt dinner; the British are not to be put off. Finally, at Captain Keene's suggestion, the gentlemen walk outside to be greeted by a bloody battle being waged in the courtyard.

January 2013|News  Photographer:\u00a0  Finn Christoffersen  This evening, The Queen and The Prince Consort hold the New Year\u2019s banquet in Christian VII\u2019s Palace at Amalienborg, where the members of the royal family will wear Denmark\u2019s most distinguished order: the Order of the Elephant.  At the tradition-rich New Year\u2019s banquet on 1 January, the Order of the Elephant is worn on the chest on a chain-link collar, which rests on both shoulders. On other occasions, the order is worn on a blue sash that extends from the left shoulder to the right hip. \u00a0  This follows a tradition that was already laid down in 1693 when Christian V issued the first written statutes, which are still valid. In those statutes it was determined, among other things, that on the Order\u2019s festival days \u2013 of which the first day of the year is one \u2013 the Order of the Elephant is to be worn on a golden chain consisting of alternating links shaped like elephants and towers instead of on a blue sash.  The Order of the Elephant, however, has a history that goes considerably further back than 1693. Far and away, it is Denmark\u2019s oldest and most distinguished royal order of chivalry. In its original form, it can be tracked back to around 1460 when Christian I, with the Pope\u2019s approval, established \u201cThe Fellowship of the Mother of God\u201d. That society\u2019s badge was a medallion of The Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus worn on a chain of tower-bearing elephants.\u00a0  In connection with the Lutheran reformation in 1536, use of the Catholic-inspired order was suspended for a number of years. In 1580, Frederik II revived it, then with the elephant as the order\u2019s badge. With the statute of 1693 came the first established rules for the presentation of the Order\u2019s insignias: the tower-bearing elephant, the chain-link collar, the blue sash, and the star worn on the left chest. These rules are still in force.\u00a0  Facts  THE ELEPHANT  The explanation of why the badge is a tower-bearing elephant is that the collar of \"The Fellowship of the Mother of God\" (the Order of the Elephant\u2019s predecessor) contained a tower-bearing elephant. The choice of the elephant as the actual badge therefore signalled a certain form of continuity between the older pre-Reformation Catholic order and the revived Order of the Elephant from 1580. Through this artifice, it was possible, on one hand, to put the old Catholic order at a distance but also, on the other hand, to signal a discreet link, which ensured the Order of the Elephant a venerable age.  No valid explanation can be found in the Order of the Elephant\u2019s statutes or other available material as to why the elephant gained foothold as a symbol in a Danish order.  \u00a0  BESTOWALS  From 1580 until now, around 890 persons in all have received the Order of the Elephant.\u00a0  During The Queen\u2019s 40-year reign, the Order of the Elephant has been bestowed upon 68 people in all. The recipients have been royal persons and foreign heads of state; once, the order was given to a common-born Dane, namely the recently deceased shipowner M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller, in appreciation of his great importance to Danish economic life and the Danish society.

{"input": "Question: What year did the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France open? </s> Context: How the Channel Tunnel Was Built and DesignedHow the Channel Tunnel Was Built and Designed  Updated December 04, 2015.  What Is the Channel Tunnel?  The Channel Tunnel, often called the Chunnel, is a railway tunnel that lies underneath the water of the English Channel and connects the island of Great Britain with mainland France. The Channel Tunnel , completed in 1994, is considered one of the most amazing engineering feats of the 20th century.  Dates: Officially opened on May 6, 1994  Also Known As: The Chunnel, the Euro Tunnel  Overview of the Channel Tunnel:  For centuries, crossing the English Channel via boat or ferry had been considered a miserable task. The often inclement weather and choppy water could make even the most seasoned traveler seasick. It is perhaps not surprising then that as early as 1802 plans were being made for an alternate route across the English Channel.  Early Plans  This first plan, made by French engineer Albert Mathieu Favier, called for a tunnel to be dug under the water of the English Channel. This tunnel was to be large enough for horse-drawn carriages to travel through.  continue reading below our video  10 Best Universities in the United States  Although Favier was able to get the backing of French leader Napoleon Bonaparte , the British rejected Favier's plan. (The British feared, perhaps correctly, that Napoleon wanted to build the tunnel in order to invade England.)  Over the next two centuries, others created plans to connect Great Britain with France. Despite progress made on a number of these plans, including actual drilling, they all eventually fell through. Sometimes the reason was political discord, other times is was financial problems. Still other times it was Britain's fear of invasion. All of these factors had to be solved before the Channel Tunnel could be built.  A Contest  In 1984, French president Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher jointly agreed that a link across the English Channel would be mutually beneficial. However, both governments realized that although the project would create much needed jobs, neither country's government could fund such a massive project. Thus, they decided to hold a contest.  This contest invited companies to submit their plans to create a link across the English Channel. As part of the contest's requirements, the submitting company was to provide a plan to raise the needed funds to build the project, have the ability to operate the proposed Channel link once the project was completed, and the proposed link must be able to endure for at least 120 years.  Ten proposals were submitted, including various tunnels and bridges. Some of the proposals were so outlandish in design that they were easily dismissed; others would be so expensive that they were unlikely to ever be completed. The proposal that was accepted was the plan for the Channel Tunnel, submitted by the Balfour Beatty Construction Company (this later became Transmanche Link).  The Design for the Channel Tunnels  The Channel Tunnel was to be made up of two, parallel railway tunnels that would be dug under the English Channel. Between these two railway tunnels would run a third, smaller tunnel that would be used for maintenance, including drainage pipes, communication cables, drainage pipes, etc.  Each of the trains that would run through the Chunnel would be able to hold cars and trucks. This would enable personal vehicles to go through the Channel Tunnel without having individual drivers face such a long, underground drive.  The plan was expected to cost $3.6 billion.  Getting Started  Just getting started on the Channel Tunnel was a monumental task. Funds had to be raised (over 50 large banks gave loans), experienced engineers had to be found, 13,000 skilled and unskilled workers had to be hired and housed, and special tunnel boring machines had to be designed and built.  As these things were getting done, the designers had to determine exactly where the tunnel was to be dug. Specifically, the geology of the bottom of the English Channel had to be carefully examined. It was determined that although the bottom was made of a thick layer of chalk, the Lower", "truth": ["1994"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2512", "mistake": "December 04, 2015", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: What is a commmon name for the United Nations peacekeeping forces? </s> Context: United Nations peacekeepingPeacekeeping by the United Nations is a role held by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations as \"a unique and dynamic instrument developed by the Organization as a way to help countries torn by conflict to create the conditions for lasting peace.\"  It is distinguished from both peacebuilding, peacemaking, and peace enforcement.  Peacekeepers monitor and observe peace processes in post-conflict areas and assist ex-combatants in implementing the peace agreements they may have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, UN peacekeepers (often referred to as Blue Berets or Blue Helmets because of their light blue berets or helmets) can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel.  The United Nations Charter gives the United Nations Security Council the power and responsibility to take collective action to maintain international peace and security. For this reason, the international community usually looks to the Security Council to authorize peacekeeping operations through Chapter VI authorizations.   Most of these operations are established and implemented by the United Nations itself, with troops serving under UN operational control. In these cases, peacekeepers remain members of their respective armed forces, and do not constitute an independent \"UN army,\" as the UN does not have such a force. In cases where direct UN involvement is not considered appropriate or feasible, the Council authorizes regional organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Economic Community of West African States, or coalitions of willing countries to undertake peacekeeping or peace-enforcement tasks.  Herv\u00e9 Ladsous has served as the head of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) since 2 September 2011. DPKO's highest level doctrine document, entitled \"United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines\" was issued in 2008.   Process and structure  Peacekeeping forces are contributed by member states on a voluntary basis. As of 31 December 2013, the total size of the peacekeeping force is 98,200 police, troops, and military experts. European nations contribute nearly 6,000 units to this total. Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh are among the largest individual contributors with around 8,000 units each. African nations contributed nearly half the total, almost 44,000 units.   Every peacekeeping mission is authorized by the Security Council.  Formation  Once a peace treaty has been negotiated, the parties involved might ask the United Nations for a peacekeeping force to oversee various elements of the agreed upon plan. This is often done because a group controlled by the United Nations is less likely to follow the interests of any one party, since it itself is controlled by many groups, namely the 15-member Security Council and the intentionally diverse United Nations Secretariat.  If the Security Council approves the creation of a mission, then the Department of Peacekeeping Operations begins planning for the necessary elements. At this point, the senior leadership team is selected. The department will then seek contributions from member nations. Since the UN has no standing force or supplies, it must form ad hoc coalitions for every task undertaken. Doing so results in both the possibility of failure to form a suitable force, and a general slowdown in procurement once the operation is in the field. Romeo Dallaire, force commander in Rwanda during the Rwandan Genocide there, described the problems this poses by comparison to more traditional military deployments:  While the peacekeeping force is being assembled, a variety of diplomatic activities are being undertaken by UN staff. The exact size and strength of the force must be agreed to by the government of the nation whose territory the conflict is on. The Rules of Engagement must be developed and approved by both the parties involved and the Security Council. These give the specific mandate and scope of the mission (e.g. when may the peacekeepers, if armed, use force, and where may they go within the host nation). Often, it will be mandated that peacekeepers have host government minders with them whenever they leave their base. This complexity has caused problems in the field.

Morphine or cocaine?\u201d  \u201cIt is cocaine. A seven-per-cent solution. Would you care to try it?\u201d  \u2013 Dr. Watson speaking to Sherlock Holmes, \u2018The Sign of Four\u2019  Sherlock Holmes is famous for a lot of things. His deerstalker cap, his pipe, his address (\u201cTwo-twenty-one B\u2026Baker Street\u201d), his phenomenal deductive powers and of course\u2026his drug-use. That\u2019s what this posting is about.  The Holmesian Canon (the collection of short stories and the novels), was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was knighted in 1902 for services rendered during the Second Boer War (1899-1902). But before the Boer War, Doyle enjoyed the use of another title.  Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle.  That\u2019s right. He was a physician.  He wrote the Holmes stories in the considerable amounts of spare time that he had between appointments and consultations, to make the extra money that his medical practice failed to provide.  It\u2019s probably not surprising then, that medicine and drugs play a big role in the Canon, since after all, the stories were written by a doctor.  Sherlock Holmes and Drugs  The Holmesian canon gives us a window into the world of Victorian England, at the end of the 19th century. We see clothing, transport, social attitudes, science and technology. And we also get a glimpse into Victorian medicine. How many of the characters are doctors or surgeons? Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Watson, Dr. Trevelyan, Dr. Carthew\u2026the list goes on.  But Holmes\u2019s closest association with medicine (apart from Dr. Watson), is his use of drugs.  I will say this once. So pay close attention.  Sherlock Holmes was not a drug-addict.  He says so himself. Holmes\u2019s brain is overactive. It is constantly whirring around looking for things to occupy itself with. When he\u2019s working on a case, his brain is occupied with problems, facts, deductions, inferences and pieces of evidence.  When Holmes doesn\u2019t have a case, his brain has nothing to work on. Nothing to stimulate it. He gets bored and cranky. Hence the drugs. They serve to keep his brain occupied and stimulated when he doesn\u2019t have a case. He hops off them the moment that he does have one. At best, you might say that Holmes was a recreational drug-user. But certainly not an addict. If he was, he\u2019d be huffing on opium and shooting up heroin all day long, even if he was on a case\u2026which he has never done.  \u201c\u2026My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation\u2026\u201d  \u2013 Sherlock Holmes, \u2018The Sign of Four\u2019  Now, I will sit back while I\u2019m broadsided by a group of angry people screaming at their computer-screens, saying how Holmes is a drug addict because he shot himself up with cocaine and morphine, how he did tobacco, how he huffed opium and did heroin and every other kind of illicit drug imaginable. Of course he was a druggie. Those are all illegal drugs!  \u2026No they\u2019re not.  Drugs in Victorian England  You have to understand that we read the Holmesian stories through modern eyes. Through the eyes of people living in the 21st Century. When these stories were written, some well over a hundred years ago, things were very different.  The most important difference, for the purposes of this posting, is that in Victorian times, opium, morphine, cocaine, laudanum and heroin were all completely legal.  Yes they were.

{"input": "Question: What term is used when a clot forms in a blood vessel? </s> Context: World Thrombosis Day | Key TermsWorld Thrombosis Day | Key Terms  VTE Protocol  Arterial thrombosis - A blood clot that develops in an artery. A clot in a coronary artery blocks blood flow to the heart and is the underlying cause of most heart attacks. A clot that blocks blood flow in an artery in the brain is a major cause of strokes.  Anticoagulant medication - Sometimes called blood thinners; anticoagulants are used to stop the formation of blood clots, thereby reducing the risk of clots in the leg or lungs, strokes and other dangerous events. Examples include: heparin, warfarin, enoxaparin and newer drugs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban.  Atherosclerosis - A disorder caused by a buildup of plaque (a waxy substance containing fat and cholesterol) on the inner walls of large arteries. This narrows the artery and slows the flow of blood. Atherosclerosis/plaques are the underlying process on which thrombosis can take place if ruptured.  Atrial fibrillation - An irregular and often rapid heartbeat that can lead to clot formation in a chamber of the heart. In atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers called the atria beat irregularly and out of synch with the lower chambers. Atrial fibrillation can cause a stroke if the clot breaks free and travels to the brain.  Blood clot - A thick mass of blood cells, platelets and fibrin. Clotting is a natural process to stem the flow of blood from damaged blood vessels.  Blood vessels - Include (1) arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the brain, limbs and organs; (2) veins, which carry blood from the limbs and body organs toward the heart; and (3) capillaries, very small vessels that connect the two.  Cardiovascular disease - Any disease affecting the heart or the circulatory system.  Clotting - The process in which liquid blood becomes a solid mass (called a thrombus). Clotting is also called coagulation. This process is important to prevent excessive bleeding when a blood vessel is injured (such as when you cut yourself). However, the process can be harmful when clots form inside the vessel and block the flow of blood.  Clotting factors - A group of proteins (sometimes called \u201cfactors\u201d) in the blood that works together to cause blood clotting.  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - A blood clot that forms in the veins located deep within a limb, usually the lower leg or thigh. By blocking the flow of blood back to the heart, these clots are often characterized by pain and swelling of the leg. Clots in the leg can break off, travel to the lungs and lodge there as pulmonary embolism (PE). These can be fatal because they block the flow of blood from the lungs back into the heart.  D-dimer - A molecule released from the breakdown of clot; raised levels may indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), but levels are also raised in many other conditions. Measurement of D-dimer is useful to doctors in helping rule out a diagnosis of DVT or PE.  Embolus - A mass, usually a detached blood clot, that travels through the bloodstream and the heart and then lodges in an artery, blocking it.  Factor Xa -\u00a0Factor Xa converts prothrombin to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin, a blood clot. Anticoagulant drugs known as Xa inhibitors act by inhibiting Factor Xa and preventing the formation of thrombin.  Fibrin - The protein substance in blood clots; fibrin creates a web-like structure that binds together platelets and red and white blood cells at the site of injury.  Hemostasis (or Haemostasis) - Hemostasis is a physiological process that maintains blood in a fluid state normally and prevents excessive bleeding from damaged vessels. Because hemostasis has to keep blood fluid in the vessel and form clots when the vessel is damaged \u2013 two opposing roles \u2013 it is very complicated. Hemostasis is responsible for the balance between bleeding and thrombosis.  Ischemia - Insufficient oxygen supply due to a blockage or constriction of a blood vessel.

{"input": "Question: Conventionally treated as comprising a single order, which order of mammals lay eggs? </s> Context: Monotreme - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaMonotreme - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Monotreme  \u2020 Steropodontidae  Monotremes (from the Greek Word, monos 'single' + trema 'hole', referring to the cloaca ) are mammals that lay eggs ( Prototheria ) instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials ( Metatheria ) and placental mammals ( Eutheria ).  They are conventionally treated as comprising a single order Monotremata, though a recent classification proposes to divide them into the orders Platypoda (the Platypus along with its fossil relatives) and Tachyglossa (the echidnas ). The entire grouping is also traditionally placed into a subclass Prototheria, which was extended to include several fossil orders but these are no longer seen as constituting a natural group allied to monotreme ancestry. A controversial hypothesis now relates the monotremes to a different assemblage of fossil mammals in a clade termed Australosphenida .  Contents  [ edit ] General characteristics  Like other mammals, monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate (though not as high as other mammals, see below); have hair on their bodies; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young; have a single bone in their lower jaw; and have three middle ear bones.  Monotremes were very poorly understood for many years, and to this day some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them endure. It is still sometimes thought, for example, that the monotremes are \"inferior\" or quasi-reptilian, and that they are a distant ancestor of the \"superior\" placental mammals. It now seems clear that modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree; a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups.  A feature of monotremes (and also marsupials ) is the claim they don't have a gross communication ( corpus callosum ) between the right and left brain hemisphere.[ citation needed ]  A Long-beaked Echidna  The key anatomical difference between monotremes and other mammals is the one that gave them their name; Monotreme means 'single opening' in Greek, and comes from the fact that their urinary, defecatory, and reproductive systems all open into a single duct, the cloaca . This structure is very similar to the one found in reptiles. Monotremes and marsupials have a single cloaca (though marsupials also have a separate genital tract) while placental mammal females have separate openings for reproduction, urination and defecation: the vagina , the urethra , and the anus .  Monotremes lay eggs . However, the egg is retained for some time within the mother, who actively provides the egg with nutrients. Monotremes also lactate, but have no defined nipples , excreting the milk from their mammary glands via openings in their skin. All species are long-lived, with low rates of reproduction and relatively prolonged parental care of infants. Infant echidnas are sometimes known as puggles referencing their similarity in appearance to the Australian children's toy designed by Tony Barber  \"Questions about The Lost Forests\" . http://australianet.com/tlf/faq.shtml . Retrieved on 2009-03-22.  \u00a0 the same term, though not generally accepted, is popularly applied to young platypus as well. [2] [3]  Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults. Fossil forms and modern platypus young have the \"tribosphenic\" molars (with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle), which are one of the hallmarks of extant mammals. Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials, [4] although this is not well established.

Multiple versions were created using pastel, oils and tempra between 1893 and 1910. There were even intentions to quickly create more reproductions of the image when Munch created a lithograph of the piece in 1895.  Popular artist, Andy Warhol, even produced silk prints of \u201cThe Scream\u201d in 1983-1984 in order to desacralize the art even further by mass-producing it for the pop-conscious and high-consumerist fad culture of the 1980s. The iconic face of the anguished foreground character in \u201cThe Scream\u201d was undoubtedly injected into the minds of a whole new generation of moviegoers when Wes Craven\u2019s aptly names \u201cScream\u201d franchise hit cinemas in 1996. The Ghostface antagonist in \u201cScream\u201d wears a mask that was influenced by a novelty mask created in the 1991-1992 Halloween season by Fun World employee Brigitte Sleiertin, which in turn referenced Munch\u2019s painting.  The costume is the highest sold and worn costume in the United States. Due to its rapidly growing popularity, by the time Scream 3 hit theatres in 2000, the mask was referenced in many commercials and other television shows shortly after\u2013Beverly Hills 90210, Dawson\u2019s Creek, Sopranos, Simpsons and Robot Chicken to name a few\u2013cementing the visual even more firmly in the minds of the general public.  The Doctor Who character, named quite anonymously \u201c The Silence \u201d, appears in the 2011 episode \u201cThe Impossible Astronaut\u201d and bares a striking resemblance to Munch\u2019s character, which The Silence was partially based on.  It\u2019s no surprise that geek culture has latched on to the popularity of this memorable work of art to create derivative works depicting popular fictional characters for yet another generation.  Below are five mashup examples\u2013only a sampling of what has turned into a well-established troupe online. It\u2019s a safe bet for artists to use Edvard\u00a0Munch\u2019s\u00a0\u201cThe Scream\u201d as the subject of their\u00a0parody\u00a0if their\u00a0intention\u00a0is for fans to have an\u00a0immediate\u00a0awareness of the reference, even if they know nothing of the original fine art.

Frederic, a pirate\u2019s apprentice, falls head-over-heels in love with Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley. Frederic is due to be released from his apprenticeship on his 21st birthday, but there\u2019s a snag. Born on 29\u00a0February, Frederic discovers that he is technically still a youngster. Although very much in love, his dedication to duty is unshakeable. Can he find a way to live happily-ever-after with Mabel?  Synopsis  Act I  A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall  The pirates offer a toast to Frederic who is celebrating his 21st birthday and the end of his apprenticeship. Ruth, a maid who also works with the pirates, explains that when Frederic was younger she was instructed by his father to have the small boy apprenticed to a pilot, but she misheard and instead took Frederic to a pirate.  Now that his obligation to the pirates has ended, duty compels Frederic to devote himself to destroying them. When the men admit their inability to make piracy pay, Frederic explains that they are themselves slaves to their tender hearts, particularly regarding their refusal to take advantage of anyone they believe to be an orphan. Frederic wishes he could bring the pirates back to a respectable life, but the Pirate King rejects that possibility.  Ruth longs for Frederic to take her with him when he leaves. He admits that he is reluctant to marry her, though he is satisfied that, despite her age, she is beautiful. But when he sees a group of lovely young women approaching, he rages at her for deceiving him.  The young women are astonished to encounter Frederic and horrified to hear that he is a pirate. He assures them that he only wants to love one of them. They all reject him except Mabel.  The pirates surprise the girls and anticipate soon becoming their husbands. Their father, the Major General, enters and objects to the girls being married against their wills to pirates. He lies his way out of the situation by claiming to be an orphan. The girls are released from the pirates\u2019 clutches, as Mabel and Frederic \u2013 ignoring the pleas of Ruth \u2013 look forward to their marriage.

{"input": "Question: Which hymn, written by John Newton, 1727-1807, was the inspiration for a number one hit of 1973? </s> Context: John NewtonJohn Newton (; 24 July 1725 \u2013 21 December 1807) was an English sailor, in the Royal Navy for a period, and later a captain of slave ships. He became ordained as an evangelical Anglican cleric, served Olney, Buckinghamshire for two decades, and also wrote hymns, known for \"Amazing Grace\" and \"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\".  Newton started his career at sea at a young age, and worked on slave ships in the slave trade for several years. After experiencing a period of Christian conversion Newton eventually renounced his trade and became a prominent supporter of abolitionism, living to see Britain's abolition of the African slave trade in 1807.  Early life  John Newton was born in Wapping, London, in 1725, the son of Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Scatliff) and John Newton Sr., a shipmaster in the Mediterranean service. Elizabeth was the only daughter of Simon Scatliff, an instrument maker from London (the marriage register records her maiden name as Seatcliffe). Elizabeth was brought up as a Nonconformist. She died of tuberculosis (then called consumption) in July 1732, about two weeks before John\u2019s seventh birthday. Newton spent two years at boarding school before going to live in Aveley in Essex, the home of his father's new wife.  At age eleven he first went to sea with his father. Newton sailed six voyages before his father retired in 1742. At that time, Newton\u2019s father made plans for him to work at a sugarcane plantation in Jamaica. Instead, Newton signed on with a merchant ship sailing to the Mediterranean Sea.  Impressment into naval service  In 1743, while going to visit friends, Newton was captured and pressed into the naval service by the Royal Navy. He became a midshipman aboard HMS Harwich. At one point Newton tried to desert and was punished in front of the crew of 350. Stripped to the waist and tied to the grating, he received a flogging of eight dozen lashes and was reduced to the rank of a common seaman.  Following that disgrace and humiliation, Newton initially contemplated murdering the captain and committing suicide by throwing himself overboard. He recovered, both physically and mentally. Later, while Harwich was en route to India, he transferred to Pegasus, a slave ship bound for West Africa. The ship carried goods to Africa and traded them for slaves to be shipped to the colonies in the Caribbean and North America.  Enslavement and rescue  Newton did not get along with the crew of Pegasus. They left him in West Africa with Amos Clowe, a slave dealer. Clowe took Newton to the coast and gave him to his wife, Princess Peye of the Sherbro people. She abused and mistreated Newton equally as much as she did her other slaves. Newton later recounted this period as the time he was \"once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in West Africa.\"   Early in 1748 he was rescued by a sea captain who had been asked by Newton's father to search for him, and returned to England on the merchant ship Greyhound, which was carrying beeswax and dyer\u2019s wood, now referred to as camwood.  Spiritual conversion  During his 1748 voyage to England after his rescue, Newton had a spiritual conversion. The ship encountered a severe storm off the coast of County Donegal in Ulster, Ireland, and almost sank. Newton awoke in the middle of the night and, as the ship filled with water, called out to God. The cargo shifted and stopped up the hole, and the ship drifted to safety. Newton marked this experience as the beginning of his conversion to Christianity.  He began to read the Bible and other religious literature. By the time he reached Britain, he had accepted the doctrines of evangelical Christianity. The date was 10 March 1748, an anniversary he marked for the rest of his life. From that point on, he avoided profanity, gambling, and drinking. Although he continued to work in the slave trade, he had gained sympathy for the slaves during his time in Africa. He later said that his true conversion did not happen until some time later:", "truth": ["amazing grace"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6347", "mistake": "\"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\"", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "error"}

If you remember this TV event when originally broadcast in the 1970s, you will enjoy rediscovering this superb production. First time around? You are in for a treat. Reserve a long afternoon, invite over some friends, pop some corn, and settle in for a first class British soap opera.  Lillie Langtry was considered a great beauty, a femme fatale, whose admirers included Belgium\u2019s King Leopold, the Prince of Wales, and the American judge Roy Bean. Gay playwright Oscar Wilde was also caught in Lillie\u2019s net, writing Lady Windemere\u2019s Fan for her. When she portrayed Lillie, Francesca Annis was at the peak of her career, lauded for her work on stage and in film. And some would also describe her as a femme fatale, capturing the heart of a film star 18 years younger. Ralph Fiennes divorced Alex Kingston of ER fame, after he and Annis met during a production of Hamlet. They were together for 11 years.  Lillie is a feast for the eyes with the costumes and scenery worthy of a Merchant and Ivory production. Annis\u2019s dresses and gowns throughout the series are sumptuous and faithful to the period. Her jewels dazzle. After all, she was frequently on the arm of a royal and so needed to dress accordingly. With Lillie, it was a red carpet appearance every night.  But the series is more than just visual candy (although, nothing wrong with that!) The performances, by Annis and the rest of the cast are Oscar worthy. Particularly outstanding is Peter Egan as the tortured Wilde. His scenes with Lillie are alternately humorous, dramatic, and, sometimes, heartbreaking. Also worth noting is Anton Rodgers as Lillie\u2019s first husband, Edward Langtry, the only male, it seems, immune to Lillie\u2019s charms.  Because of her relationship with the future King of England, Lillie Langtry has oftentimes been called names not repeated in polite company. (This was, after all, Victorian England). Annis\u2019s portrayal, however, is multi-layered and mesmerizing. You cannot take your eyes off Annis as so many others were unable to tear their attention away from the real Lillie. Somehow one thinks that Lillie herself would laud this production.

However, unlike the book we get a more in-depth look                at why the Grinch is the way he is.

The Grinch That Tried to Steal Christmas - Montville CT PatchThe Grinch That Tried to Steal Christmas - Montville, CT Patch  The Grinch That Tried to Steal Christmas  By Donna Jacobson (Open Post) - February 8, 2014  1:21 pm ET  Dana McFee is truly the Grinch. There\u2019s no doubt about that statement. Relating back to the Dr. Seuss book, the Grinch was an evil, conniving, green guy that was exiled from Whoville and lived in a mountain of trash above the quaint little town. The Grinch caused all kinds of trouble for the Whoville residents. Yup, to politicians and some other folk in Montville, Dana is the Grinch.  So how did McFee achieve this monumental acclaim? He merely suggested the shift of residential trash removal toward a town wide trash pick-up. What could be more menacing than a public official trying to offer a way of saving money and helping residents? Yup, Dana the Grinch, had the audacity to question the way an antiquated system ran. So, to ensure that \u201cChristmas\u201d is still alive and well in Montville, certain town employees who work at the transfer station started a campaign to Dump Dana.  Now move ahead a few months to the 2013 Town Council election. The Dump Dana signs arose again from the bowels of the Transfer Station. This time, former Town Coucilor Gary Murphy jumped at the chance to ensure the Grinch remembered his place in Montville\u2019s history. Mr. Murphy placed Dump Dana signs on what could be or not be his property. Offended by the message of the sign, Mr. McFee was caught on camera supposedly swiping a sign, much like the Grinch swooping down on Whoville to ruin Christmas.  The absolutely amazing part of this specific story is that the sign swiping caused a three-month investigation by the local and State police. The sign cost $17.50, yet no one has mentioned how much the investigation and now subsequent prosecution will cost. And what State Prosecutor or even Judge in their right mind would sign a warrant on such a frivolous complaint without first trying to work out an equitable agreement between Murphy and McFee?  Nope, not in Whoville, opps Montville. Here we have a tree-climbing, camera mounting ex-Councilor trying to catch the Grinch doing his dastardly deeds. Even when the real Grinch, in the Suess book stole all the Christmas presents (which I\u2019m assuming cost more than $17.50 even factoring in inflation), he was not prosecuted by the State. I look forward to reading about Mr. McFee\u2019s day in court because in the end, no matter what the outcome, Montville yet again appears foolish. What a sad ending to this story.

{"input": "Question: The excellent cut of beef known as \"hanger steak\" is taken from what part of the animal? </s> Context: Hanging Tender - Resource - Smart Kitchen | Online Cooking ...Hanging Tender - Resource - Smart Kitchen | Online Cooking School  Tweet  \u00a0  Contrary to what you might read in many places, the Hanging Tender,\u00a0NAMP\u00a0140,\u00a0 also known as the Hanging Tenderloin, Hanger, Pillar,\u00a0Onglet\u00a0(French) and Butcher\u2019s Tenderloin, is not a \u201cpart\u201d of the diaphragm of an animal. It is instead a muscle and cut of meat that has stumped a lot of butchers, including published authors like Merle Ellis, who wrote the useful meat book\u00a0 Cutting Up in the Kitchen\u00a0 where he said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the Hanging Tender is. I\u2019ve looked in dozens of reference books and talked to scores of butchers, and nobody seems to know just what the thing is. It\u2019s just there.\u201d  The \u201cthing,\u201d the Hanging Tender, is an elliptical-shaped portion of muscle that is called the \u201cPillar of the Diaphragm.\u201d\u00a0 The pillar is actually the V shaped union of two smaller muscles, joined by a membrane that together help to hold the diaphragm in place. The pillar gets its Hanging Tender name because it literally hangs off the kidney just below the tenderloin on the inside of the left, and only the left, hindquarters and attaches to the last rib. Because it is only found on the left side, there is only one Hanging Tender per steer.  Economical, Hanging Tenderloin is known for its rich, beefy flavor. Some may label the flavor profile \u201clivery,\u201d a taste that old wives\u2019 tales attribute to the Hanger\u2019s proximity to the kidneys. But the truth is that Hanger Steak is only livery if overcooked. Shorter cook times reduce the incidence of \u201cliver\u201d flavor and are a tactic that old wives should try.  When looking for a whole Hanging Tender, you will likely have to order in advance, seek out a\u00a0Specialty Butcher, or try a Mexican market where Hanging Tender may be marketed as \u201cArrachera.\u201d  To cut\u00a0 Hanger Steaks\u00a0 from the Hanging Tender, just remove the silver skin membrane (by starting a tear with the point of a knife and then pulling on it with your fingers), trim as much external fat as you choose to (retaining some external fat allows it to crisp up when cooking) and then separate the two lobes along the thick vein of inedible fat that runs lengthwise up the middle of the Hanging Tender. If there is a leathery silver skin fascia skin on your Hanging Tender, remove it by poking a hole in the Silver Skin to open it and then pulling/trimming it away with your fingers or a\u00a0 Paring Knife . Some chefs allow this skin to burn off but that can lead to excessive charring, so Smart Kitchen advises removing it.  Also don\u2019t worry if your raw meat has some gray \u201cburns\u201d on the meat. They are likely scalds from the hot water wash used to prevent E Coli contamination in the packing plant. The Hanging Tender is an \u201cinterior\u201d cut and gets sprayed. If you have any gray areas and you find them unsightly, trim them off.  Hanging Tender can also be found cut into strips for\u00a0Fajitas\u00a0or\u00a0 Bulgogi\u00a0 and as part of a custom\u00a0Ground Beef\u00a0Mixture. Some restaurants swear by a ground beef mixture of 40% Hanger, 40%\u00a0 Chuck\u00a0 and 20% beef fat.  The roughly V-shaped Hanger steak has historically been more popular in Europe (in the U.K. it is known as a\u00a0 Skirt Steak ) but is gaining in popularity in the U.S. Tough, almost stringy and lacking the\u00a0 Marbling\u00a0 of more expensive cuts, in the domestic meat case, the Hanging Tender is typically trimmed of excess fat, denuded to remove the thick silver skin membrane surrounding the meat and separated along a thick, inedible, central elastic vein of fat into two roughly equal lobes, (though one will be larger) to form\u00a0 Steaks .

Read on Owl Eyes  This eText is now on Owl Eyes. Clicking this link will open a new window.  When exclaiming \"The play's the thing!\" we're seldom asked the embarrassing question of what \"thing\" we mean, exactly. Prince Hamlet, however, has something specific in mind. To elicit visible proof of what a rather visible ghost has told him\u2014that his uncle, King Claudius, murdered his father, the former king\u2014the prince turns playwright. His task: to sneak a few telling lines into a play about regicide his uncle will be watching at court, and to wait for Claudius to flinch. If Hamlet's plan works, he'll be convinced of both the ghost's veracity and the king's guilt and will (theoretically) feel better about paying his uncle back in kind.  The plot is intricate and bizarre, but Hamlet is relying on good, solid Renaissance psychology. Playwrights often claimed that their work encouraged virtue in upstanding citizens and caught the conscience of malefactors. About ten years after the first production of Hamlet , playwright Thomas Heywood edified the reading public with this real-life tale: During the performance of a particularly gruesome tragedy, in which the actors staged the murder of a man by driving a nail through his temple, a woman in the audience rose up distractedly.

The son of Jewish immigrants, he took the stage name Vaughan from his grandmother whose Russian accent pronouncing the endearment \"my little one\" sounded like Vaughan. As a child, he was a member of the National Association of Boys' Clubs which he continued to patronise later in life, donating money throughout his life. At the age of 14 he won a scholarship to the Lancaster College of Art and began singing with a dance band although he originally thought of becoming a boxer, indeed much of his army life during World War II was spent boxing in the Royal Army Medical Corps.  After the war, he returned to the Leeds College of Art where he won a prize to design a furniture exhibition stand. Travelling down to London, he entered a radio talent show which was the start of his long career in entertainment. Beginning in theatres in variety song and dance acts, always dressing immaculately in a top hat, tails and carrying a cane, the ultimate image of a gentleman, he sang for a while with the Nat Temple Band before signing a solo contract with Philips Records. His first few hits were all covers of American hits, \"Istanbul\", \"Happy Days and Lonely Nights\", \"Tweedledee\" and \"Seventeen\", all of which reached the top 20, and the song that became his trademark, \"Give Me the Moonlight\", always sung with the broadest of grins and high kicking at the end of each line was not a sales hit, but he would have to wait until the end of 1956 for his first really big hits when his version of \"Green Door\" hit no.2 and the follow up \"The Garden Of Eden\" in January 1957 became his first no.1. 1957 was a good year for Vaughan with several more hits, \"Man On Fire\", \"Wanderin Eyes\", \"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\" and a collaboration with The Kaye Sisters, \"Gotta Have Something in the Bank Frank\".  He was one of the traditional singers not affected by the coming of Rock n Roll and continued to enjoy hit singles throughout the remainder of the 1950s, culminating in a second chart topper, Tower Of Strength in 1961. His first chart album was the live recording of Frankie Vaughan At The London Palladium in 1959 and although during the 1960s he concentrated on other projects than show-business, he continued to enjoy hit records, including There Must Be A Way, a top 10 hit in 1967 during the summer of love.

Operation Overlord had begun.  First an air-based landing took place very early in the morning, with both British and American troops being parachuted in to occupied France, followed by a sea-based invasion at 6.30 in the morning. In just that one day 130,000 troops were landed on the Normandy coast at Sword, Juno, Gold, Omaha and Utah beaches.  The map show the principal landing points along the Normandy coast  Despite a great deal of lives lost (50,000 in Calvados alone), these battles represented the turning point of the Second World War in western Europe.  Visiting the beaches  For many people a visit to the beaches of the Normandy Landings is a pilgrimage rather than a holiday destination. Many still have memories of that time while others have memories of relations lost in the battles on those beaches.  The memorial on Omaha Beach is a simple yet very beautiful tribute to the Normandy Landings  As you walk along the beaches or through the cemeteries, the sense of history and importance of the places is inescapable. It is an extremely moving event to walk on the Normandy Landings beaches, and also to visit the cemeteries containing thousands of graves in well tended lines, and to reflect on what the world might be like today without the bravery and victory of those landings.  If you plan to visit the Normandy Landing beaches, the coast road can be followed to Sword, Juno, Gold and Omaha beaches - and Utah beach is just a little further.  At Gold Beach this defensive gun position still points out to sea as a reminder...  West of Omaha Beach you can also visit Pointe de Hoc and see the cliffs that the US troops needed to climb as part of the landings in the face of strong defence from the Germans - the various bunkers and craters left by the bombs remind us how severe the battle was at this point.  Several important cemeteries are also passed along this route, while just off Gold Beach at Arromanches you can see the remains of the floating harbour (the Mulberry Harbour) built hurriedly by the allies and used during the landings.  The remains of Mulberry Harbour, just off Gold beach at the town of Arromanches  Many visitors to the landing beaches also like to see the Cafe Gondr\u00e9e, the first house in France to be liberated in the landings. In truth there is little to actually see on the beaches themselves apart from the remains of the Mullberry harbour and a moving tribute built in the sand at Omaha beach.  The War Cemeteries are an evocative reminder of the large numbers that died during the invasions. This is the American War cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer overlooking Omaha Beach  Behind the beaches you will see the remains of bunkers used by the Germans to defend the territory, and even some barbed wire fence sections have been left intact.  The Merville Battery posed a very serious threat to the landings and its elimination was a primary goal for paratroopers from the 6th Airborne Division prior to the land-based landings  Battles of Normandy Museums  There are several museums dedicated to the events including:  The Memorial Museum for the Battles of Normandy in Bayeux offers a great deal of information about the landings.  At Utah Beach and in\u00a0 Arromanches there are Landing Day Museums - the museum at Utah Beach includes various large equipment used in the landings  The Museum of the Occupation is at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont  The Museum of the Liberation can be seen at Cherbourg  An Airborne Museum is found at Sainte-Marie-Eglise  The Memorial Museum of Omaha Beach is at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer  You can find more local travel ideas in the Calvados guide and the Normandy guide .", "truth": ["normandy"], "id": "mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3589", "mistake": "Normandy", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "trivia", "init_status": "pass"}

{"input": "Question: Which ship did Drake command against the Spanish Armada? </s> Context: Francis DrakeSir Francis Drake, vice admiral (\u00a0\u2013 27 January 1596) was an English sea captain, privateer, navigator, slaver, and politician of the Elizabethan era. Drake carried out the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580, and was the first to complete the voyage as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation. With his incursion into the Pacific he inaugurated an era of privateering and piracy in the western coast of the Americasan area that had previously been free of piracy.  Elizabeth I of England awarded Drake a knighthood in 1581. He was second-in-command of the English fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588. He died of dysentery in January of 1596  after unsuccessfully attacking San Juan, Puerto Rico.  His exploits made him a hero to the English but a pirate to the Spaniards to whom he was known as El Draque.  King Philip II was said to have offered a reward of 20,000\u00a0ducats, about \u00a34\u00a0million (US$6.5m) by modern standards, for his life.  Birth and early years  Francis Drake was born in Tavistock, Devon, England. Although his birth is not formally recorded, it is known that he was born while the Six Articles were in force. \"Drake was two and twenty when he obtained the command of the Judith\"  (1566). This would date his birth to 1544. A date of c.1540 is suggested from two portraits: one a miniature painted by Nicholas Hilliard in 1581 when he was allegedly 42, the other painted in 1594 when he was said to be 53.1921/22 edition of the Dictionary of National Biography, which quotes Barrow's Life of Drake (1843) p. 5.  He was the eldest of the twelve sons  of Edmund Drake (1518\u20131585), a Protestant farmer, and his wife Mary Mylwaye.  The first  son was alleged to have been named after his godfather Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.Froude, James Anthony, English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century, London, 1896. Quote: \"He told Camden that he was of mean extraction. He meant merely that he was proud of his parents and made no idle pretensions to noble birth. His father was a tenant of the Earl of Bedford, and must have stood well with him, for Francis Russell, the heir of the earldom, was the boy's godfather.\"  Because of religious persecution during the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549, the Drake family fled from Devonshire into Kent. There the father obtained an appointment to minister the men in the King's Navy.  He was ordained deacon and was made vicar of Upnor Church on the Medway.Southey, Robert. (1897). English Seamen\u00a0\u2014 Howard Clifford Hawkins Drake Cavendish, Methuen and Co. 36 Essex Street WC London Drake's father apprenticed Francis to his neighbour, the master of a barque used for coastal trade transporting merchandise to France. The ship master was so satisfied with the young Drake's conduct that, being unmarried and childless at his death, he bequeathed the barque to Drake.  Marriage and family  Francis Drake married Mary Newman in 1569.  She died 12 years later, in 1581.  In 1585, Drake married Elizabeth Sydenham\u2014born circa 1562, the only child of Sir George Sydenham, of Combe Sydenham,  who was the High Sheriff of Somerset.  After Drake's death, the widow Elizabeth eventually married Sir William Courtenay of Powderham.   Sailing career  At age 23, Drake made his first voyage to the Americas, sailing with his second cousin, Sir John Hawkins, on one of a fleet of ships owned by his relatives, the Hawkins family of Plymouth. In 1568 Drake was again with the Hawkins fleet when it was trapped by the Spaniards in the Mexican port of San Juan de Ul\u00faa. He escaped along with Hawkins.  Following the defeat at San Juan de Ul\u00faa, Drake vowed revenge.  He made two voyages to the West Indies, in 1570 and 1571, of which little is known.

{"input": "Question: In 2006 Monty Panesar became the first person of what religion to play test cricket for England? </s> Context: Juggling with destiny | Sport | The GuardianJuggling with destiny | Sport | The Guardian  The Observer  Juggling with destiny  Last year, few had heard of Monty Panesar. Now he has his own celebrity book deal and heads to Australia as a cult hero and England's most potent bowling weapon. But who is he? What does he want? Emma John met him over the course of two months at home in Luton to talk about family, the thrill of his first Ashes tour and the guiding light of his Sikh faith  Saturday 28 October 2006 21.05\u00a0EDT  First published on Saturday 28 October 2006 21.05\u00a0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  'I am neither a child, a young man, nor an ancient; nor am I of any caste' - Guru Nanak  They call it the Monty Effect. Since Mudhsuden Singh Panesar - renamed Monty by an affectionate aunt - was picked for England last winter, his first club, Luton Town and Indians CC, have not been able to cope with the demand. 'There's a constant stream of children wanting to join,' says Viren Patel, the team manager. 'We could fill this place with 250 kids. But we're a small club and we don't have the resources. We're having to send them elsewhere.'  Panesar's appeal, throughout and beyond cricket, has been a summer sensation. Perhaps it's because you couldn't make this person up. Some will remember the wickets he took this summer with his left-arm finger-spin - great, ripping deliveries, such as the one that bowled the excellent Younis Khan during the Headingley Test against Pakistan. Others might celebrate his being the first Sikh to play cricket for England, at a time when the search for multicultural icons has never seemed more urgent. Most, however, will remember the exuberant dance that followed each of his 27 dismissals. With an elongated leap through the air, eyes on stalks, he hurled himself towards his team-mates in an ecstasy of cartoonish disbelief.  There is, too, his hapless fielding and incompetent batting that have brought ironic cheers from the crowds and so frustrated England coach Duncan Fletcher. Even after Panesar took eight wickets in the match to inspire England to victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in July, Fletcher remained grudgingly sceptical. 'Would we need Monty on a green top?' he asked. 'It's very important that we look at Monty on wickets that don't help him as much as it did [here] ... I still have slight reservations about his batting and his fielding.'  We first meet in late August at the Regent Lodge Hotel in Luton, the kind of bland, dilapidated structure that has given the town such a bad rap, but it's conveniently situated near his parents' home, where he still lives and which he feels no urgency to leave. Family is important to him. Plus, his mum's an ace cook and he doesn't have to do his own laundry.  There is no sign, in the quiet man who greets me, of the bowler who glares at opponents with such intensity. Panesar is dressed casually - he has come straight from a cousin's 18th birthday party - and talks, patiently but awkwardly, about the two summer series, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, in which, at 24, he became England's latest bowling star. 'I was very much star-struck,' he says. 'The team would do things to help me, like playing darts with Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison, getting me involved. It helped get the nerves out of my system.'  Panesar has been playing county cricket for Northamptonshire for five years, but has been an England player for only eight months and retains a charming naivete. While Andrew Flintoff returns after a Test match to his million-pound house in Cheshire, Monty heads back to the family's modestly sized semi-detached.

Benoit Tessier/Reuters  World Anti-Semitism Europe  The mob howled for vengeance, the missiles raining down on the synagogue walls as the worshippers huddled inside. It was a scene from Europe in the 1930s \u2013 except this was eastern Paris on the evening of July 13th, 2014.  Thousands had gathered to demonstrate against the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. But the protest soon turned violent \u2013 and against Jews in general. One of those trapped told Israeli television that the streets outside were \u201clike an intifada\u201d, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.  Some of the trapped Jews fought their way out as the riot police dispersed the crowd. Manuel Valls, the French Prime Minister, condemned the attack in \u201cthe strongest possible terms\u201d, while Joel Mergei, a community leader, said he was \u201cprofoundly shocked and revolted\u201d. The words had no effect. Two weeks later, 400 protesters attacked a synagogue and Jewish-owned businesses in Sarcelles, in the north of Paris, shouting \u201cDeath to the Jews\u201d. Posters had even advertised the raid in advance, like the pogroms of Tsarist Russia.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week  France has suffered the worst violence, but anti-Semitism is spiking across Europe, fuelled by the war in Gaza. In Britain, the Community Security Trust (CST) says there were around 100 anti-Semitic incidents in July, double the usual \u00a0number. The CST has issued a security alert for Jewish institutions. In Berlin a crowd of anti-Israel protesters had to be prevented from attacking a synagogue. In Liege, Belgium, a caf\u00e9 owner put up a sign saying dogs were welcome, but Jews were not allowed.  Yet for many French and European Jews, the violence comes as no surprise. Seventy years after the Holocaust, from Amiens to Athens, the world\u2019s oldest hatred flourishes anew. For some, opposition to Israeli policies is now a justification for open hatred of Jews \u2013 even though many Jews are strongly opposed to Israel\u2019s rightward lurch, and support the establishment of a Palestinian state.  As Stephen Pollard, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle, argues: \u201cThese people were not attacked because they were showing their support for the Israeli government. They were attacked because they were Jews, going about their daily business.\u201d  One weekend in May seemed to epitomise the darkness. On May 24th a gunman pulled out a Kalashnikov assault rifle at the Jewish Museum in Brussels and opened fire, killing four people. The next day the results of the elections to the European parliament showed a surge in support for extreme-right \u00adparties in France, Greece, Hungary and Germany. The National Front in France won the election, which many fear could be a precursor to eventually taking power in a national election.  Perhaps the most shocking result was the surge in support for Golden Dawn in Greece. The party, which has been described as openly neo-Nazi, won almost 10% of the vote, bringing it three members of the European parliament.  In parts of Hungary, especially the impoverished north and east, Jobbik is the main opposition to the governing right-wing Fidesz. Jobbik won 14.7% of votes at the European elections. The party denies being antisemitic but even Marine Le Pen, leader of the French National Front, ruled out cooperating with them in the European parliament.  In November 2012, Marton Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si, a senior Jobbik MP, called for a list to be made of Hungarian Jews, especially those working in Parliament or for the government, as they posed a \u201cnational security risk\u201d. (Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si later apologised and said he was referring only to Jews with dual Israeli-\u00adHungarian citizenship.)

From the towering glacial highlands of its spine to the sweaty mangrove swamps of the coast, Irian Jaya is one of the world's last great wildernesses: maps of the area still show stretches as wide as 300km without any relief data at all. Despite numerous attempts by Western explorers to tame Papua, the colossal island all but repelled them right up until the latter part of the twentieth century. On Indonesian Independence , it seemed logical that West Papua should itself become independent. After all, the capitals of Jakarta and Jayapura are as far apart as London and Baghdad. However, while the Dutch prepared the island for union with Papua New Guinea, the Indonesians, with the collusion of the US, planned to ensure that every part of the old Dutch East Indies would become Indonesian. On November 19, 1969, the UN passed a resolution to endorse an Indonesian occupation of West Papua, on the understanding that a Vote of Free Choice would be held within six years. The vote was stage-managed by the Indonesians and West Papua was ceded entirely to the Indonesians, to be renamed Irian Jaya, or \"Victorious Irian\". Since then, tribal villages have been bombed and napalmed, and local leaders tortured, executed or dropped out of helicopters. The cleansing, or pacification, of native people in Irian paved the way for the largest transmigration scheme the world has ever seen, with four million new inhabitants in little over a decade. An estimated 300,000 Papuans have lost their lives to the Indonesian tyranny, and 15,000 are refugees in New Guinea. The OPM (Organisas Papua Merdeka), or Free Papua Movement, is still particularly active in the jungles of the Lorentz reserve and parts of the Bird's Head; kidnapping foreigners is their means of drawing attention to their cause and common sense is your best precaution. In 2001, in an unsubtle but generous attempt to buy peace, Megawati offered the Papuans autonomy within Indonesia, and sanctioned a change of name for the province, from the unpopular Irian Jaya to the locally preferred Papua. Whether it will be enough to appease the OPM and their allies, however, remains to be seen.  However short, a trip to Irian Jaya requires more planning than any other destination in Indonesia. The first complication is the surat jalan (travel permit) that must be acquired from the police by every visitor on arrival in Irian, with signed permission for each and every one of the small districts you wish to visit. Apply for every feasible destination, as you can't add places to your surat jalan outside of the large towns. Photography in Irian is also a different proposition to other parts of Indonesia. No matter what they say, most X-ray machines at airports are not film-safe; take films out and have them searched by hand. Take great care when photographing people; in areas where photography is rare it can cause great distress, and in areas where it is common, permission and cash are expected first. Bring all camera film to Irian with you. Prices in Irian are a shock after the rest of Indonesia. There is almost no industry on Irian Jaya and everything but a few foodstuffs is imported at great expense by boat or plane from other areas of Indonesia. A lousy fleapit hotel costs twice as much in Irian as a reasonable guesthouse anywhere else; food and fuel are also expensive as they have to be imported. Chartering transport and hiring guides is likely to be the greatest expenditure: up to US$50 for a day in a canoe, or US$500 in a motorized outboard.

It might be easier to count how many you\u2019ve watched which don\u2019t feature the giant (in more ways than one) of French cinema.  Though younger actors like Vincent Cassel and Romain Duris are building names for themselves over here in gritty crime dramas and superior rom-coms like last year\u2019s Heartbreaker , Depardieu just keeps coming back. He currently has two films out in UK cinemas, Potiche , a 1970s-set comedy of sexual politics starring fellow veteran, Catherine Deneuve , and a road-trip movie called Mammuth .  Depardieu\u2019s physical presence has always been striking, but he also stands out for his versatility, successfully switching from the farcical to the romantic to the touching to the chilling, in both arthouse French and blockbuster Hollywood films.  Here are our top five Depardieu roles:  1 - Cyrano de Bergerac (1990)  The role with which Depardieu will always be identified, mainly for that nose.  \u00a0  2 - Jean de Florette (1986)  Another character that\u2019s memorable for his distinctive physical appearance, in this much-loved Claude Berri film Depardieu plays an eternally optimistic hunchback, tricked by a pair of scheming locals when he moves his family out to the country. The film became a bit of a clich\u00e9 with its alluring Provencal scenery, but it\u2019s an incredibly poignant story.  \u00a0  3 - Green Card (1990)  Depardieu starred opposite Andie MacDowell in this rom com about a Frenchman who marries an American woman so he can stay in the US. They have to pretend to really be in love when their marriage is investigated. You\u2019ll never guess what happens. Though Depardieu\u2019s Frenchman is a massive stereotype (he\u2019s a bon viveur who loves his steak and red wine, she\u2019s a vegetarian who eats \u2018bird seed\u2019), his characteristic mix of the obnoxious and charming hits the mark.  \u00a0  4 - Mesrine: Killer Instinct (2008)  Cuddly he ain\u2019t in this true-crime gangster flick, in which he plays scary gangland boss Guido.  \u00a0  5 - Potiche (2010)  Depardieu plays the communist mayor who helps Deneuve\u2019s character to  take control of her husband\u2019s factory. It turns out they have a history  together... Though he often seems to mumble his lines, making us  grateful for the subtitles, he\u2019s still a force to be reckoned with.  Are you a Depardieu fan?

The 40-year-old American actress has been described in the past as \"a model condescending to play a movie role\" in films such as Sex, Lies and Videotape, Michael, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Green Card; and yet, despite often tepid reviews, MacDowell manages to resurface time and again in big budget Hollywood movies.

Have you ever wondered how many licks it takes to get to the core of a          giant jaw breaker? 1, 2,3\u0085slurp. The earth is in some ways like a          giant jaw breaker. It is composed of several layers: the crust, the mantel,          and the core.  CRUST  What comes to mind when you think of the word crust? Perhaps it is the          time old saying,\" Eat your crust!\" The earth's crust is a little different          then the crust on a piece of bread. It is not soft and chewy, but it hard          and composed of different minerals. The thin, outermost layer of the earth          is called the crust. It makes up only one percent of the earth's mass.          The continental crust is thicker than the oceanic crust. It can range          from 25 km thick at the edges to 70 km thick near the center. The oceanic          crust on the other hand is only about 7 km thick and considerably more          dense. The crust and the uppermost part of the mantle make up the lithosphere,          a solid region that is broken into plates. It is about 65 to 100 km thick.  MANTLE  The mantle is the layer below the crust. It makes up almost two thirds          of the earth's mass and is about 2900 km thick. The mantel is divided          into two regions, the upper and lower sections. Directly below the upper          section is the asthenosphere. Heat and pressure cause a          small amount of melting to occur in the asthenosphere. While still solid,          the asthenosphere is able to flow. The ability of a solid to flow is called plasticity. See \" What's          the matter ?\" for an activity to demonstrate plasticity. Since the          asthenosphere is more liquid than the rest of the mantle, the broken lithosphere          plates are able to \"float\" on it.  When the material in the asthenosphere is heated, it becomes less dense          and rises. While the cooler material is more dense tends to sink. Circulating          currents carry the warmer material up and the cooler material down. These          circular currents in the asthenosphere are called convection currents. The circulating convection currents cause the plates to move.  \u00a0  CORE  Below the mantle is the core, the center of the earth. It makes up nearly          one third the mass of the earth. The core is also divided into two regions,          the inner core and the outer core. From seismic or earthquake waves, scientists          believe the outer core is a liquid and the inner core is a solid. The          outer core is made of iron and is very dense. Scientists hypothesize that          the circulation of the outer core causes the magnetic field around the          earth. It is believed to be circulating in the counter-clockwise direction          giving us the north pole in its present location. It switches about every          million years. A record of this \"switching\" is recorded in the rocks both          on land and in the ocean crust. See \" Go west young          man! But which way is north? \"The inner core is made of solid iron          and nickel. Many scientists believe it is kept in the solid state because          of the extreme pressure from the other layers.

Negative Dihedral will decrease lift on the 'rang, and will produce a lower  flight.  Positive Attack will shorten the overall flight of the boomerang.  Negative Attack will increase the overall flight of the boomerang.  Mix and match until you have the boom tuned to your throwing style.

Below are some e-mails I gleaned from BoomerangTalk or RangList  Fast Catch Tuning - John Cross, Calgary  Alberta  [ Top ]  I thought I'd throw in some input on fixing problems with tribladers - fast  catches in particular. Jason had some good tips but I figured I'd post what I  know on the subject. Sorry I'm a bit slow but you know - busy with work yadda  yadda yadda. What follows is fairly extensive. It covers most of what I know and  can recall off the top of my head. A lot of these are little tidbits I've  collected off the likes of Ted Bailey, Rusty, Gel, Dan Neelands, Eric Darnell,  Doug Dufrense, Mark Weary and probably a few others not to mention some of the  better web sites out there. Thanks to everybody in advance for sharing. They  gave me the starting points to work with but all that follows is what works for  me from experiments on my own. The ideas didn't necessarily come from talk about  performance booms but often just from comments on carving tips that I tried and  applied to my booms.  There are always a number of different ways of achieving any effect on a boom.  Sounds like you have the basics of twist and bending tuning for your fast catch  fairly well down. For anybody who doesn't know how to do it, I find the best way  is to pretend you have a two blader (think of it as just a two-blader with a big  elbow). I mark the other two arms like I would if it was a two-blader. One is  the lead arm and the other is the dingle arm. Since it is now a two-blader  (although a funny looking one) you can now use Dr. Fred's tuning method. The \"lead\" arm controls range (adjust with AOA) and height at the beginning of the  flight (adjust with dihedral). The \"dingle\" arm controls accuracy (AOA) and the  height in the later part of the flight (again adjust with dihedral). Bending and  twisting can usually get you pretty close to having a really good flying boom  but sometimes there are problems you just can't seem to fix. Then again, you  might want to try to fix them another way just for fun. Below are the problems I  could think of you can have with your FC boom and some alternatives to bending  and twisting you might want to try out to get your stick performing just right.  Tinkering like this has provided me with many hours of enjoyment and  frustration. Hopefully this will save you some of the later.  Flies too high  This is usually fixed by bending negative dihedral into one or more of the arms.  There are a few other ways of doing this too. You can carve it into your boom by  extending the trailing edge around the tips. Go out with a piece of sandpaper  and take it off slowly right at the tip. You'll be impressed how you can control  the level of the flight. Look at an advance FC by Eric Darnell and you will see  what I mean. Compare the way the tip is carved to that of a sport boom such as  an Alpine by Colorado. The sport boom will likely have the leading edge extended  around the tip rather than the trailing edge.

The Everlys sprang from the traditional country music with which they had grown up, but in the late 1950s they took up the themes of teenage love and disappointment that became the staple diet of the emerging pop stars of the period. They never fully embraced rock and roll, but their breezy harmonies influenced many of the stars who followed them, including The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, and The Byrds \u2014 groups whose popularity started to take off as that of the Everlys waned.  As they were overtaken by new musical fashions from the early 1960s onwards, The Everly Brothers continued to perform and record until 1973, when their relationship fractured publicly during a concert in California.  Phillip Everly was born in Chicago on January 19 1939, the son of Ike and Margaret Everly, who had a popular country singing act in the 1940s. He was almost exactly two years younger than his brother Don, but the boys\u2019 parents brought them up as though they were twins. They shared birthday parties, and were dressed in the same clothes \u2014 Don was not allowed to have a sports jacket until Phil was old enough to have one too.  Related Articles  Felice Bryant  24 Apr 2003  Both boys attended high school at Shenandoah, Iowa, where their parents had a radio breakfast show, on which Don and Phil sang from childhood. After the family had moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, the brothers met the guitarist and producer Chet Atkins and other figures on the local music scene. They were briefly signed up to Columbia, for which they made their first record, Keep a-Lovin\u2019 Me, which was released in February 1956 but made little impact.  It was when The Everly Brothers were taken up by the Cadence record label that their careers began to take off. In 1957 they recorded Felice and Boudleaux Bryant\u2019s Bye Bye Love, on which Phil and Don played guitars alongside Chet Atkins and the Nashville session musician Ray Edenton. The song was an immediate hit, and established the brothers as the first successful pop act to come out of Nashville. Don and Phil bought a new Oldsmobile on the proceeds and embarked on a tour with Johnny Cash. They began sporting matching suits, and their growing army of fans had difficulty telling them apart (Don\u2019s hair was darker, and his the deeper voice).  They followed this success in the same year with Wake Up Little Susie; This Little Girl of Mine; All I Have to Do Is Dream; and Claudette. Bird Dog and Devoted to You were released in 1958, and by now they were one of the most famous pop acts in the United States, as well known as Elvis Presley, Pat Boone and Ricky Nelson. They became close to Buddy Holly, who originally wrote his song Not Fade Away for The Everly Brothers \u2014 they suggested that he record it himself.  After the release of Let It Be Me in 1959, the Everlys moved to Warner Bros Records. Cathy\u2019s Clown, written by Don, remained at No 1 in America for five weeks in 1959 and topped the British charts for seven, selling more than eight million copies worldwide. On the back of its success Cadence delved into its archive to release When Will I Be Loved, which reached No 8 in the US and No 4 in Britain.

Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise -- something scientists say will not happen. Still, skeptics have filed suit to try to stop the project.   It even has a rap dedicated to it on YouTube.Scientists say the collider is finally ready for an attempt to circulate a beam of protons the whole way around the 17-mile tunnel. The test, which takes place Wednesday, is a major step toward seeing if the the immense experiment will provide new information about the way the universe works.\"It's really a generation that we've been looking forward to this moment, and the moments that will come after it in particular,\" said Bob Cousins, deputy to the scientific leader of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. \"September 10 is a demarcation between finishing the construction and starting to turn it on, but the excitement will only continue to grow.\"The collider consists of a particle accelerator buried more than 300 feet near Geneva, Switzerland. About $10 billion have gone into the accelerator's construction, the particle detectors and the computers, said Katie Yurkewicz, spokewoman for CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is host to the collider.In the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. It will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year, and the experiments could generate enough data to make a discovery by 2009, experts say. Check out the collider complex's six detectors \u00bbTesting the unknownExperts say the collider has the potential to confirm theories about questions that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions. They also hope to find a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson, which has never been detected, but would help explain why matter has mass.The collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, when there was a hot \"soup\" of tiny particles called quarks and gluons, to look at how the universe evolved, said John Harris, U.S. coordinator for ALICE, a detector specialized to analyze that question.Since this is exploratory science, the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories, but which are just as interesting, said Joseph Lykken, theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.\"When Columbus sails west, he thought he was going to find something. He didn't find what he thought he was going to find, but he did find something interesting,\" said Lykken, who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of six experiments inside the collider complex.Why should the layperson care about this particular exploration?

Shakespeare died in 1616.The Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.The most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.The identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.The portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"Wells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"It should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.The public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.The portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "truth": ["London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust."], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-4101", "mistake": "the Cobbe family", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died from her injuries shortly afterward.Police said that Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ads service.The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. \"It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,\" the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted on  its Web site.Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blonde man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which had asked for the public's help in identifying the man.Police did not release a photo of Markoff on Monday.Four days before Brisman's killing, Markoff allegedly robbed a 29-year-old woman at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said.A police spokesman would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were \"involved in similar professions.\"\"This is a compelling case with a myriad of evidence -- with computer evidence being a part of it,\" Conley said, adding that additional search warrants would be executed this week.Markoff's arraignment was set for Tuesday morning at the Boston Municipal Court.

The bloody era, when the military used kidnapping, torture and murder to silence dissidents, became known as the \"Dirty War.\" The seven-year junta claimed an estimated 30,000 lives.Galli's parents and grandmother were among the victims.On June 12, 1977, 16-month-old Marianela, her mother, Patricia, her father, Mario, and her grandmother, Violeta, were kidnapped from their home in Buenos Aires. They were taken to the Argentine Naval Mechanics School, known as ESMA, the largest and most notorious of dozens of detention centers operated by the Argentine military at that time.After three days in captivity, the military released Galli and gave her to her father's family. Her parents and grandmother remained inside the ESMA, where they endured two months of torture before being drugged and then thrown alive from an airplane into the chilly waters of the South Atlantic.Thousands perished in the weekly Wednesday \"death flights,\" and most of their bodies were never recovered.\"I don't have my parents with me.

Five-thousand people passed through the white-washed walls of the ESMA.

It's a dynamic environment, with changes occurring by the day and week, not over millions of years.The space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about Earth's closest neighbor.An announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier: There's water on the moon.The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or L-CROSS, and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon's south pole in October and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place. L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep.Michael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is.\"We're opening new chapters. And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,\" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information.\"Wargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon \"is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system.\"Earthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface.The presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.NASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit.Wargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites.\"We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,\" according to Wargo.The LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system.The LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations.All this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way:\"We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet. ...

DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.The \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.\"  Watch firefighters testify \u00bbRicci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an \"unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph.\"Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She left the session after concluding her remarks earlier Thursday.Sotomayor argued before committee members Tuesday that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of \"a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court\" and followed an established precedent.\"This was not a quota case or (an) affirmative action case,\" she said. The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were \"disparately impacted\" by the test.New Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said.The question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter.Based on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court.Ricci was one of several witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor.Linda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that \"it is clear\" from Sotomayor's record \"that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics.\" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge when she has \"shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her,\" Chavez said.Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci case was, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents dating back almost three decades, he said.New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor, telling committee members that she is an \"independent jurist\" with a \"sharp and agile mind\" who would bring \"a wealth of unique experience\" to the high court.", "truth": ["reverse discrimination"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-2706", "mistake": "merit-based civil service system", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

See Josh Levs' interview with Pajitnov and Rogers \u00bbCNN: Alexey, I want to start with you. When you first dreamed up this scenario all those years ago, did you ever imagine it would turn into a global phenomenon?Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris creator: The very first time when my small game started working even without scoring or leveling, I couldn't stop playing. It's a really good game, but I [couldn't] imagine that it would be that big.Henk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software: When I first found it at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1988, I kept on coming back and playing more. And that was a for sure sign that this was going to be a good game.CNN: There are stories of people going in to work on the weekends just to sit at their computer and play for hours. They even dream the Tetris shapes if they play for too long. Could one of you explain to me why it's so addictive and what goes on when you play it?Pajitnov: First of all, it's a very simple game and it has a really strong creative spirit in it. So instead of destroying something, you kind of build up the profile out of those small pieces and enjoy doing it. And that's probably the very important addictive factor.CNN: The simplicity and also the immediate satisfaction -- but then immediately it's time to work for the next one.Pajitnov: Yes.CNN: Henk, tell us some of the stunning statistics.Rogers: Over 70 million products have been sold as a box product, and more recently on the mobile [market] we're almost reaching 80 million downloads worldwide.

Watch a search of the rapper's home \u00bbHe was held in federal custody over the weekend.Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon.Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past.However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that \"a number of people\" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were \"two sides to every story -- sometimes three\" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor.The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped.Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards.The show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest.Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\"At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet.\"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.\"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\"The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement.The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said.The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said.On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns.

Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds.Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend.News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days.Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris.Gallo Records called the death \"senseless and random,\" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was.South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked.\"It's very sad,\" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. \"He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists.\"Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York.His record company said Dube leaves \"a great void\" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans.Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named \"Lucky\" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies.Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career.Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss.\"Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,\" Haarburger said. \"It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically.\"Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

{"input": "Question: What makes up half of Afghanistans GDP? </s> Context: UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy.Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007.The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006.Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said.Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground.The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year.According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade.Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001.\"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\"James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade.\"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\"He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly.\"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said.Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said.However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked.According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes.Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region.He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors.\"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said.Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production.\"You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said.

Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections.He had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo \u00bbBilly was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age.He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.)Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.He sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring.

When I want to talk, I'll talk.\"Del Potro went on to claim his first grand slam, ending Federer's five-year unbeaten run at Flushing Meadows and denying the Swiss maestro a 16th grand slam title.Federer's fine pales in comparison to the one meted out to Serena Williams, who was docked $10,000 for an altercation with a line judge at the climax of her semifinal with eventual winner Kim Clijsters.Williams reacted angrily after being called for a foot fault, and unleashed a torrent of abuse at the official, who reported the exchange to umpire Louise Engzell.The resulting penalty point for a code violation handed the match to Clijsters.Williams later apologized for the incident. She was also fined $500 for racket abuse in the same encounter.Over $31,000 in fines were handed out in the final grand slam of the season with Daniel Nestor, from Canada, forced to pay $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct towards a fan he confronted.Vera Zvonareva of Russia and Austria's Daniel Koellerer were also fined $1,500 for audible obscenities.Federer will get an early chance to put his U.S. Open disappointment behind him when he plays for Switzerland  in a World Group playoff tie against Italy this weekend in Genoa.", "truth": ["five-set"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1155", "mistake": "five", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

{"input": "Question: What is as important as the face transplant itself? </s> Context: CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The woman who received the first-ever near-total face transplant in the United States told her doctor she has regained her self-confidence, said Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic and leader of the transplant team.This illustration represents the transformation of a patient who underwent a near-total face transplant in December.The patient, who prefers to be anonymous, is finally able to breathe through her nose, smell, eat solid foods and drink out of a cup, Siemionow told participants of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago over the weekend.The complex surgery, a 22-hour procedure, took place in December at the Cleveland Clinic. The patient received her new face in one graft from a donor cadaver.\"I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world,\" Siemionow said.  Watch an animation of the face transplant \u00bbThe patient had previously \"suffered severe facial trauma,\" the Cleveland Clinic said. She had no nose, right eye or upper jaw before the procedure, and could not smell or eat normally. People would call her names on the street, Siemionow said.The surgery gave the patient a nose with nasal lining, as well as a palate. This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said.Social reincorporation is as important as the face transplant itself, Siemionow said. At this point, the patient doesn't want to face the \"common world,\" but she is facing her family, the surgeon said.The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said. She can also taste a hamburger and pizza, and drink coffee from a cup, the \"things we take for granted every day,\" Siemionow said.The patient also received lower eyelids, upper lip, skin, muscles, bone, hard palate, arteries, veins and nerves.As for the aesthetics of the new face, Siemionow suggested that restoring function was more important. \"At this point, no one is really looking at beautification,\" she said.Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.Only patients who had already exhausted all possible options for conventional repair were considered for the transplant, Siemionow said.Currently, cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because  transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue, Siemionow said. In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said.While burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said.Previously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China. The Chinese recipient, Li Guoxing, died in July of unknown causes, Guo Shuzhong, a doctor involved in the case, confirmed to CNN.One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. The other French patient had been bitten by a dog. The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear.European news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant, which would be the fifth in the world.Researchers are also making headway into treatments for disorders that give rise to facial abnormalities, experts say. They are identifying genes that become mutated and cause the skull and facial features to become distorted.\"We're moving into the arena where we can do medical treatment,\" Dr. Ethylin Jabs, professor of developmental and regenerative biology at Mount Sinai Medical School, said at the conference.One", "truth": ["Social reincorporation"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1090", "mistake": "Social reincorporation", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "pass"}

CNN's Christiane Amanpour meets the Dalai Lama and some of his unruly flock in \"Buddha's Warriors\" airing Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 11 p.m. ETThe Dalai Lama cracked jokes and chatted when a storm knocked out power during his interview with CNN.DHARAMSALA, India (CNN) -- I never knew much about Buddhism, and was not expecting much, spiritually, from covering the Dalai Lama. But what happened just goes to show how the unlikeliest events can affect you at the unlikeliest times.I flew from covering the historic visit of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in North Korea to Dharamsala, India. This is the home-in-exile of the Dalai Lama and his government, as well as thousands of Tibetan monks and supporters.Our visit coincided with the events that commemorate each March 10, the date the Dalai Lama fled Tibet on horseback in 1959. He managed to evade the Chinese Communist forces, disguised as a soldier and escaping at night. The somber remembrance is a little like what the Palestinians do every year. They call it al-Nakba, or \"catastrophe,\" which marks 1948 when they lost much of their land as the state of Israel was founded.This year, however, the March 10 anniversary took on a more ominous tone. It was the first time the growing split among Tibetan exiles burst into the open. Some of the younger generation of exiles are losing faith in the Dalai Lama's abandonment of the dream of Tibetan independence. Some want action, even if it might mean abandoning their peaceful Buddhist way.I wanted to ask the Dalai Lama about this and where he thought it would lead.The day we visited, we attended a \"Long Life Ceremony\" in which thousands of Tibetans come from all over India and across the Himalayas from Tibet to catch a glimpse of their spiritual leader, to pray for his continued health and long life and to bestow their most precious gifts upon him, including cubes of dried cheese wrapped in muslin, textiles and tapestries.It went on for more than two hours. I never thought I would sit through the whole thing, but something about the chanting, the incense and the vital connection between the Dalai Lama and his adoring flock was mesmerizing.  Watch: Amanpour investigates new breed of Buddhists \u00bbAs a journalist and an observer, I was transfixed.Even though the Dalai Lama has spent nearly 60 years in exile, people are still so faithful to him, so respectful, weeping, bowing low as they pass him sitting high above on his throne-like dais. He towers over them, and yet there is nothing removed or dictatorial about him.  See behind-the-scenes photos from Buddha's Warriors \u00bbAfterwards we prepared for our interview. He gives many, and I wondered what we could elicit from him that would be new or noteworthy. As our cameramen were setting up, I hung around outside to quietly watch as he received the first of many visitors that day: dignitaries, ordinary tourists, prayer groups and school groups.  I've found you can tell almost everything about a person by observing the way they deal with others. He was kind, witty, warm, laugh-out-loud funny and deeply moved by some of the personal tales he heard from those visitors seeking his advice and blessing. I thought about how he must do this so many hundreds of thousands of times and yet he had time for everyone, treating each one like a VIP.Once we sat down, I was immediately slightly thrown off by his style. He told us very clearly that what the Chinese are doing in Tibet amounts to \"cultural genocide.\" And then he burst into his trademark giggles. I couldn't fully understand why, but it is apparently the Buddhist way to laugh off life's horrors, and thus survive.

Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category.Then there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French .Paul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots. Larsen achieved the speed in 22 knot winds, and shortly before his unusual \"boat\" became airborne and flipped.Larsen's speed is just awaiting formal approval from the WSSRC.

I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues.The development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records.\"The fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records,\" the spokesman said.He said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work.\"It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right,\" he said.The spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008.

Amado Carrillo was known as \"El Senor de los Cielos,\" the \"Lord of the Skies,\" because of the fleet of jetliners he used to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico.Carrillo Leyva, 32, was presented at the news conference, surrounded by black-clad, hooded law-enforcement officials. He wore dark-frame glasses and a white jogging suit with double black stripes on the sleeves. His dark hair was long and shaggy.Last month, federal officials offered a reward of up to $2.16 million (30 million pesos) for information leading to his arrest. The same reward has been offered for his uncle, cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, also known as \"El Viceroy\" and \"El General,\" who remains at-large.Rewards of $2 million apiece have been offered for 22 other leading cartel suspects.Wednesday's arrest was the fourth detention of a top drug cartel leader in recent weeks.Last week, officials announced the arrest of Hector Huerta Rios, also known as \"La Burra\" or \"El Junior,\" a top lieutenant of the Beltran Leyva cartel. He was arrested in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Nuevo Leon state, along Mexico's border with the United States.The previous week, Mexican authorities announced the arrest of Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, a drug-trafficking suspect accused of attacking a U.S. consulate and killing Mexican soldiers. Talamantes, also known as \"El Canicon,\" also is suspected in attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex agency said.That same week, the Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant.Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame drug cartels for a surge in violence in the region.Despite the violence, Mexican officials say the country is generally safe and that tourist areas such as Cancun and Acapulco are heavily patrolled. Watch Leyva get escorted by law enforcement officials \u00bbOfficials from Acapulco city hall, the Guerrero state government and the Mexico attorney general went so far as to sign a statement in early March assuring students wanting to go there on spring break that efforts had been taken to ensure their safety.In a speech in mid-March, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 93 percent of the 6,500 deaths attributed to organized crime in 2008 occurred among the criminals. Most of the rest were law enforcement authorities, officials have said.Few civilians are killed, the president said.In that same speech, Calderon ridiculed those who say Mexico is unsafe.\"It is absolutely false, absurd, that anyone indicate that Mexico does not have control over one single part of its national territory,\" he said. \"I challenge anyone who says that to tell me what part of the country they want to go to and I will take that person there.\"Analysts point out that most of the violence is occurring along the U.S. border, particularly in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua and Tijuana. Drug cartel violence is also found on Mexico's western coast.\"The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,\" the U.S. State Department said in a February 20 travel alert. \"Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city", "truth": ["32,"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-3552", "mistake": "32", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Question: Who has not yet signed bill? </s> Context: (CNN) -- Now that Arizona lawmakers have passed what's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back.Arizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them.Critics, including immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status.The bill made it through the state Senate on Monday after it was passed by the state House last week. It's now awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. Supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. Latino members of Congress are calling on Brewer to veto it.Michael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped draft the language of the Arizona bill. The institute is the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.On the heels of the Arizona initiative, Hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. He declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege.\"Arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" Hethmon said. \"If you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- Arizona is the place to do it.\"Hethmon pointed to Arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in Arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. It's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\"Republican State Rep. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the legislation in Arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent.State laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the National Conference of State Legislatures.In 2005, 300 bills were introduced. The next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. Another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009.About 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education.About1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year.Hethmon cited the election year, the Democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation.\"Historically, not only in the U.S. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said.Whether Arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said Ann Morse, the program director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Immigrant Policy Project.\"Certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. With court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, Morse said.Omar Jadwat, the staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants Rights' Project, said following in Arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction.\"Although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, I think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that Arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said.Isabel Garcia, a legal defender in Arizona's Pima County, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\"\"We have not seen this kind of legislation since the Jim", "truth": ["Republican Gov.

The pope addressed the crisis that has rocked the Irish Catholic Church in an 18-page pastoral letter, which was made public Saturday.Critics said the pope did not go far enough in the letter.The acceptance of Magee's resignation came only days after the pope's letter was published.The leader of Ireland's Roman Catholics, Cardinal Sean Brady, wished Magee well in a statement, but said he had to focus on the victims of abuse.\"Foremost in my thoughts in these days are those who have suffered abuse by clergy and those who feel angry and let down by the often inadequate response of leaders in the Church,\" said Brady, who has himself come under fire for failing to report what he learned during an investigation into a priest who became one of Ireland's most notorious child abusers.Brady was part of an internal Church investigation into Father Brendan Smyth in 1975. He did not report his findings to the police and asked two teenagers who gave him evidence to sign oaths of secrecy.In the past five years, Ireland's Catholic Church has had three separate outside investigations into child abuse -- both sexual and physical -- by priests, nuns, and staff at Catholic-run institutions such as schools and orphanages.Four bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the most recent, the Murphy Report, which found a widespread tendency to cover up child abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin between 1975 and 2004.Only one of those resignations has been accepted -- that of Bishop Donal Murray on December 17.The resignation of Bishop Magee is not related to any of the recent statutory reports, said Patsy McGarry, religious affairs correspondent for the Irish Times newspaper.Instead, it is rooted in an internal church report on child protection practices in his Cloyne diocese in southern Ireland.In 2008 the Catholic Church's own child protection watchdog, the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland conducted an audit of child protection practices in every diocese in Ireland, McGarry explained.It found those to be \"inadequate, and in some respects dangerous\" in Cloyne diocese.Its findings were published in December 2008, prompting calls for Magee to resign.Magee did not resign, but he was effectively stripped of his authority in March 2009, when Archbishop Dermot Clifford of the neighboring diocese of Cashel and Emly was appointed \"apostolic administrator\" of Cloyne diocese.The Murphy Commission -- which produced the report into the Dublin archdiocese -- is now investigating Cloyne diocese, McGarry said.

Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year, which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win.Earlier this month, the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption, fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki's political arch rival. The judge called the case invalid and accused Mbeki's government of political interference.Mbeki -- who has been South Africa's president for nearly 10 years -- spoke of some of his achievements when he formally announced his resignation on Sunday during a televised address.  Watch the significance of Mbeki \"falling on the sword\" \u00c2\u00bb\"I depart this office knowing that many men and woman in South Africa have worked to achieve better lives for all,\" Mbeki said.Under his leadership the country has had the longest period of sustained economic growth in the South Africa's history and has reached out to indigent people in an unprecedented way, Mbeki said.Mbeki said the country still has economic, corruption and crime challenges to face in the future. And he gave his vote of confidence to the country's next leader without naming who that leader would be.Gwede Mantashe, secretary-general of the African National Congress, announced Saturday that the party -- which Mbeki has been involved with since his teens -- had asked him to leave before his term was up.Mbeki agreed to do so, he said.Mantashe said the ANC made the decision \"for the citizens of South Africa, so there could be stability within the country\" and so the ANC movement could remain \"stable and unified.\"The case against Zuma -- who replaced Mbeki as ANC president last year -- was thrown out in September 2006, but the National Prosecuting Authority recharged him. Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma's guilt or innocence, and he could be recharged.Political observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma's popularity, particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions.Zuma has denied the charges. He said the case was politically motivated, and harmed his chances to become the ANC's presidential nominee.He could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal.He also faced charges of having a corrupt relationship with his former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who is serving a 15-year sentence for soliciting bribes for Zuma and using Zuma's political influence to benefit his businesses.Mbeki, 66, succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president in June 1999. Critics alleged he pushed for the corruption charges against Zuma.Mbeki recently brokered a power-sharing deal between Zimbabwe's political rivals, who signed the agreement on Monday in an effort to put aside the violent past and end the crisis that has paralyzed Zimbabwe since disputed national elections in March.Under it, longtime Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe remains president, while his", "truth": ["Ten"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1374", "mistake": "Ten South African ministers and the deputy president", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.25}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation.And so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners.CNN: You're in a unique position.

{"input": "Question: Which industry was unfairly criticized? </s> Context: During CNN's \"Going Green: Green Light for Business\" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline.LONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions.Jet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside.The sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue.This is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency.There is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky.Practically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change.The reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues.Aviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating.Punitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development.Meeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake.We identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet.The 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing.Aircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of \"over flights\" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum.We wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create.With the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about", "truth": ["The aviation"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-2505", "mistake": "aviation", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "pass"}

Markoff, who was under police surveillance, was arrested earlier in the afternoon after a traffic stop south of the city, police said.Markoff is suspected in the death of New York City resident Julissa Brisman, 26, who was found unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on April 14. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died from her injuries shortly afterward.Police said that Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ads service.The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. \"It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,\" the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted on  its Web site.Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blonde man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which had asked for the public's help in identifying the man.Police did not release a photo of Markoff on Monday.Four days before Brisman's killing, Markoff allegedly robbed a 29-year-old woman at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said.A police spokesman would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were \"involved in similar professions.\"\"This is a compelling case with a myriad of evidence -- with computer evidence being a part of it,\" Conley said, adding that additional search warrants would be executed this week.Markoff's arraignment was set for Tuesday morning at the Boston Municipal Court. It was not immediately clear if he had retained defense counsel.Davis and Conley warned there may be other victims that come forward in the case.\"We would like to make one final pitch to those out there who may have been a victim of robbery at the hands of Philip Markoff, especially those who may have used Craigslist in the manner in which the victim used Craigslist,\" he said.Authorities received more than 150 leads in the case, which Davis credited to the popularity of the Web site.\"The public came forth, they were fascinated by this crime,\" he said, adding, \"I wish we had this level of cooperation in every homicide that occurred.\"Davis said Boston investigators were working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, in what could be a related case.On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney.The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney.He said no conclusions could be made, but allowed that the incident \"may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area.\"  Watch police say assailant is perusing Craigslist ads \u00bbCraigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster said the company was \"horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence.\"He promised that Craigslist would evaluate the incident to see if additional measures could be introduced to further protect users.CNN's Jason Kessler contributed to this report.", "truth": ["the armed robbery and kidnapping of another victim,"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-838", "mistake": "murder", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: what do the studies show? </s> Context: (CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: \"Why are our kids so messed up?\" \"Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?\" \"What's happening in our schools?\"These are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the \"bystander effect\": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it.Unfortunately, this \"What's wrong with our children?\" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening.Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community.Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: \"What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?\"The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus.Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it.Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, \"I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. .Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information.This dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence.

The ship was repurposed and commissioned for civilian exploration voyages in 1825. How long: Five years Legacy: Aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected specimens and began to develop his theories of evolution, which would later crystallize in \"The Origin of Species.\"Columbus discovers the New WorldWhen: 1492 Who: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus Where: From Spain to the Caribbean The boats: The Santa Maria was a 70 ft, three-masted ship built from pine and oak, that could carry 40 men. The Nina and the Pinta were both smaller, nimbler boats with triangle-shaped masts better for navigating tricky waterways. The square-sail Santa Maria ran aground in modern-day Haiti on Christmas Day 1492. Legacy: Searching for a new way into the East Indies spice route, it was aboard these three ships that Columbus unintentionally discovered the Caribbean.'Micro-yachtsman' crosses the Atlantic in miniature boatWhen: 1993 Who: American Hugo Vihlen Where: Across the North Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Cornwall, England The boat: The Father's Day, the world's tiniest sailboat at a length of 5 ft 4 in, was so small that Vihlen had to roll up into a ball to sleep, and couldn't stand up without opening the hatch and risk taking on water. Likened to a space shuttle, the boat is made from fiberglass-enclosed Airex foam and was fitted with GPS, a water maker, VHF radio and SSB/Ham radio. Legacy: Aboard the Father's Day, Vihlen became the world's first \"micro-yachtsman,\" but it wasn't all smooth sailing -- the boat was surrounded by whales, nearly capsized, and caught the tail end of a hurricane during its 105-day voyage. What world-changing voyages would you add to our list? Sound Off belowMagellan navigates Cape HornWhen: 1519 Who: Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan Where: Around the world bypassing Cape Horn, South America via a narrow strait The boat: Given to Magellan by King Charles I of Spain, The Victoria was the only one of five ships to complete the trip successfully. Only 18 of its original 237 crew members survived and the ship was so badly damaged it was only kept afloat by the crew continuously pumping water out of the hull. How long: Three years Legacy: During the first ever circumnavigation of the world Magellan discovered a shortcut through a waterway in the southern tip of Chile, which helped sailors to avoid the almost continuous ocean storms off Cape Horn. The voyage also established the need for an international date line -- as the explorers found upon return that their calendars were one day off.Pilgrims sail to Plymouth RockWhen: 1620 Who: The Pilgrims Where: From England to Plymouth Rock The boat: Primarily used as a cargo ship, in this instance the Mayflower, which was estimated to be between 90 and 110 ft, was used to transport 102 English separatists.

They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"\"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.One anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.Google focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.Although Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.Conquering the Internet with Chinese characteristicsSo what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?While 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.Moreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.In short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.One could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.Among the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.Tencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China.\"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So.\"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible.

This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start.His address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy.That said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward.Despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral.With Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help?Turkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together.Reading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women.No matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences.Instead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing.Indeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner.

{"input": "Question: What has killed scores of people in Afghanistan? </s> Context: KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan lawmakers have directly accused Pakistan's intelligence agency of involvement in a string of deadly attacks in Afghanistan, blasting their neighbor as \"the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism.\"The recent attack by a suicide bomber on the Indian embassy in Kabul killed more than 40 people.A Pakistani official Tuesday bristled at the accusation, saying that Afghan lawmakers were making allegations without proof.\"We are not an irresponsible nation and we don't blame our failures on others,\" said a senior official with Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). \"If they want to engage in this kind of game, let them be.\"The Afghan Cabinet made the scathing indictment in a resolution Monday, saying Afghanistan would boycott a series of meetings with Pakistan unless \"bilateral trust\" is restored.In recent weeks a wave of attacks carried out by Islamic militants have killed scores of people in Afghanistan, including an assault on a military outpost Sunday that killed nine U.S. soldiers, as well as a suicide attack on the Indian Embassy a week ago that killed 58 people.The two incidents, along with an assassination attempt against Afghan President Hamid Karzai at a military ceremony on April 27, are \"indicative of the attempts by the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) to once again occupy Afghanistan and to perish the true right of the people of Afghanistan for national sovereignty,\" the resolution said.Afghanistan regularly accuses Pakistan's intelligence service -- which once had strong ties with the Taliban -- of orchestrating attacks inside its borders.Pakistan has repeatedly denied involvement, including in the incidents that the resolution cited. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also said there is no indication that \"foreign agents\" were responsible for the embassy attack.The senior ISI official said Tuesday that if Afghanistan has proof that Pakistani intelligence agents were involved in the attacks, that proof should be presented and the ISI will act on it.The official said that the Pakistani government could also blame incidents in Pakistan, like recent attacks in Karachi and Hangu, on others. But without proof, he said, it would be irresponsible.Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous history that dates back several years. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets.After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically.It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in Washington and New York. But Afghanistan claims that Pakistan continues to informally support the militants, who operate from havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share.Adding fresh ammunition to the suspicions, the Rand Corp. -- a U.S. think tank -- released a report last month that said some members of Pakistan's intelligence service and its paramilitary corps were helping insurgents in Afghanistan.The study, funded by the U.S. Defense Department, alleged that members of the two agencies often tipped off militants to the location and movement of coalition forces trying to rout them. It also said personnel within the agencies trained fighters at camps in Pakistan, financed them and helped them cross the border into Afghanistan.The Pakistani military denied and denounced the report, calling it a \"smear campaign\" designed to \"create doubts and suspicion in the minds of (the) target audience.\"Relations between the two countries are strained to such a point that Karzai has threatened to send troops across the border to take on the militants.\"The people of Afghanistan and the international community have come to the reality that Pakistan intelligence institutions and its army have become the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism and extremism to the world and particularly to Afghanistan,\" Monday's resolution said.", "truth": ["suicide bomber"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1221", "mistake": "a wave of attacks carried out by Islamic militants", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

{"input": "Question: Who attended court? </s> Context: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's fear that promoters would \"pull the plug\" on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded, the head of the promotion company testified Tuesday in Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial.\"No one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug,\" said Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live.Murray's defense lawyers contend Jackson self-administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a \"desperate desire to get to sleep,\" because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his \"This Is It\" tour.Jackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson were in court to watch Tuesday's testimony.Earlier Tuesday, a nurse who tried to treat Jackson's insomnia with natural remedies testified that Jackson told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored.Jackson died two months after that conversation with nurse Cherilyn Lee, from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with sedatives.Prosecutors contend Dr. Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home was reckless, in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls.Phillips was the eighth witness called by the defense since the prosecution rested its case against Murray Monday morning.If the tour was canceled, Jackson would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs, Phillips said, although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been.Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff estimated the cost to be about $40 million, leaving him \"a very, very poor man,\" but it was not while the jury was present.Concert director Kenny Ortega sent Phillips an e-mail five days before Jackson's death referring to Jackson's fear the company would \"pull the plug\" on the tour. The e-mail triggered a meeting with Jackson and Dr. Murray to address Ortega's concerns about Jackson's \"lack of focus\" and missed rehearsals, with the debut of his London shows just three weeks away.He and Ortega were satisfied when Jackson told them \"You build the house and I will put on the door and paint it,\" suggesting he would be ready, Phillips testified.Also at the meeting, Phillips told Dr. Murray that he wanted to make sure he knew about Jackson's visits to another doctor, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. \"Because he's his principal physician, I thought he should know,\" he said.Phillips said he was concerned because Jackson \"seemed a little distracted and not focused\" in a meeting after a visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic.The defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol in his frequent visits to Klein in the three months before his death. His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends.Testimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. \"I'm feeling really, really dizzy,\" Lee said. \"This is just very sensitive to me.\"Lee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009. This was after Dr. Murray had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol.Lee, who used IV drips loaded with vitamins, \"sophisticated\" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, to treat Jackson's insomnia, said Jackson became frustrated with her natural remedies.\"He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'\" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol.After some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use", "truth": ["Jackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-2972", "mistake": "Jackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "pass"}

And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" McCracken says.The McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.\"I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,\" McCracken said.When the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.McCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. \"My heart sank,\" he says. \"It just sank.\"Unlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. \"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,\" McCracken says.Now the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?\"Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,\" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER \u00bbIn most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.But then there's what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.\"Talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,\" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"Here, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.1.

Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home.\" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed.Asiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince.According to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported.Mohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack.Saudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake.SPA adds that \"the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time.\"Asiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them.Some of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more.Saudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen.Earlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested.While the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an \"action of treachery and treason\", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its \"open-door policy\" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, \"those citizens residing outside the country\" who wish to \"take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.\"", "truth": ["Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri,"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1491", "mistake": "Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "pass"}

He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move.Brown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating.\"I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,\" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence.\"This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,\" he said.Eastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars.The inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison.\"Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,\" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. \"It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment.\"There is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country.Meditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say.In the past five years, books like the \"Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism\" and \"Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison\" have emerged.\"This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,\" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings.Since its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates.For the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado.Some inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time.Buddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists.Some inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering.The practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days.One inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary \"The Dhamma Brothers,\" said Vipassana was harder than the 8\u00bd years he had spent on death row.

Kapoor responded by enrolling in acting classes and taking singing and dance lessons.He made his Bollywood debut in 1979's \"Hamare Tumhare,\" before moving on to Telugu-language movie \"Vamsa Vriksham\" in 1980, and landing his first Bollywood starring role in 1983's \"Woh 7 Din.\"Watch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. \u00bbKapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979, when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor. He decided that he would propose marriage as soon as he got his big break and 1984's \"Mashaal\" was the opportunity he'd been waiting for. Kapoor's performance won him Best Supporting Actor at India's prestigious FilmFare awards and he married Sunita in May of that year.Kapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful \"Mr India,\" which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans. He has gone on to become one of the biggest names in Indian cinema, picking up a total of five FilmFare awards and a National Film Institute Best Actor award for his role in 2000's \"Pukar.\"Following in his father's footsteps, Kapoor made his debut as a producer in 2002, with the comedy \"Badhaai Ho Badhaai,\" and he went on to produce \"Gandhi, My Father,\" which portrayed the fractious relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal.For years now, in his home town of Mumbai Kapoor has been mobbed by fans wherever he goes, instantly recognizable by his trademark mustache, which he has proudly sported in all but three of his hundred-plus movies.But like most Bollywood stars, he received little acclaim outside India. That changed abruptly and unexpectedly with the release of low-budget British movie \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The film has become an international sensation, winning four Golden Globe awards and receiving an astonishing 10 Oscar nominations.See Anil Kapoor's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" success in photos. \u00bbKapoor's role as the creepy quiz show host earned him a share in the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Cast.

{"input": "Question: When did the shooting take place? </s> Context: Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Seeking to identify the man who shot dead another man outside a store in Naples, Italy, in the spring, an anti-mafia prosecutor distributed on Thursday a video showing the execution.The surveillance-camera video, shot May 11, shows a man wearing a baseball cap, dark jersey, blue jeans and running shoes entering a store, walking to the back and looking around, then walking out. As he exits, he pulls a pistol from his right front pants pocket and shoots a man standing outside the store.As the victim buckles to his knees and then sprawls headlong on the pavement, the killer approaches him from behind and squeezes off a second round into the back of his head, turns and strides unhurriedly out of camera view.Passers-by appear unfazed. One woman tries to lift the victim's head in an apparent attempt to see whether she knows him; a man steps over the body.\"Indeed, it is ugly to see people behaving as if that was not a dead body and going on their daily routine,\" a police spokesman said. \"Unfortunately, this is not an anomaly in Naples and in that neighborhood.\"He said fear led people to behave that way.The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said anti-mafia prosecutor Sergio Amato released the video to the media in hopes that someone would recognize the killer and his apparent accomplice: a man who had been standing next to the victim and walked off just before the shooting.Police said no motive has been determined for the killing, which took place in the poor neighborhood of Rione Sanita, where Camorra -- the name for organized crime in Naples -- is strong.The victim was a bank robber, the spokesman said.Italian Minister for Equal Opportunities Maria Rosaria Carfagna called the video \"tragic.\"\"It shows us, finally, without any censorship, a disgusting side of the Camorra, which along with all the rest of its disgusting faces, has forced a city, a region, a territory, to be ashamed of itself and to hide its real face.\"A street homicide, in broad daylight, in the center of a great European city cannot be considered normal and even less be accepted by the conscience of all Italians as if it were a TV show,\" she said.\"The police forces are waging a battle against organized crime, as the number of arrests shows us.

Last year, Efron's \"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\" bowed with $42 million, and while \"17 Again\" may have fallen short of that mark, it still represents an auspicious maiden voyage for Efron's post-Disney career.Despite the raft of critics who pooh-poohed the film, which received a 61 percent fresh rating on Rottentomatoes.com, audiences were more favorably inclined, giving it a strong A- CinemaScore.Landing at No. 2, the Russell Crowe-Ben Affleck thriller \"State of Play\" pulled in $14.1 million.

After her rescue, Dean, her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions.\"There is speculation that this would have been the bag. It's a leather and canvas bag. You would easily get a child or infant in it,\" Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag.Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, \"we expect it to fetch \u00a33,000 ($4,480).

Fast forward 400-plus years, and we don't really have an official bard, per se -- at least not in corporeal form.Nope, if you want to put your finger on the entity that's currently shaping and torquing our lexicon like a game of drunken Twister, you're already there: Look down at your keyboard, and then at the screen and down at your keyboard again. Yup. Our bard would be the internet, breeding ground of such gems as \"BRB,\" \"tweet,\" and, sadly, \"OMG!!!!!\"Some may call the advent of internet-speak the demise of the English language, and to them we would say, \"STFU.\"Last year, \"unfriend\" was deemed the word of the year by the Oxford American Dictionary. So, much like that tattoo of your initials you got emblazoned across your butt last summer after too many G&Ts, this new slang is here to stay.Besides, Shakespeare coined the word \"puke,\" so it wasn't all sunshine and roses back in the 1500s, anyway.Still, there are some internet terms that don't quite translate when applied to real-life situations (or, OK, any situation other than the original and intended one), because they're too obtuse, redundant or just plain stupid.Here's our take on three of the most awkward phrases and symbols to go from screen to scene:#Ah, the hashtag. First introduced into the Twitter lexicon by Chris Messina in 2007, the hashtag was originally a way to tie together common threads of conversation (e.g., Follow Friday, tweets relating to events, news about natural disasters).Now, however, the hashtag has also become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on the microblogging site (\"This weekend has completely murdered my soul #whiskeyandheartache), and, more recently, to denote sarcasm and caustic wit (\"Wow, I really enjoyed that show. Etch-a-Sketch art is totally dope. More free wine, however, would have made the experience much more tolerable. #JustSayin').That's all well and good in the Twitterverse, but when taken into the real world, the hashtag is a bit harder to hash out.You see, the majority of society -- you know, the people who don't sit in front of their computers tweeting about how \"Eating pancakes makes me feel like death now that I'm 30 #notakidanymore\" -- doesn't understand what the hell you're saying when you tack what amounts to a pound sign onto any given sentence/word in your correspondence (e-mails, etc.). In fact, they could get offended by what you think is an artfully punctuated joke.Listen, we do not yet have a symbol that translates into sarcasm (despite lofty efforts by the folks over at Sarcmark), and the hashtag is no exception. So, for now, stick to being caustic and dry, and even then, watch your mouth. Not everyone is socially fluent enough to recognize superior wit when they see it. #JustSayin'...@MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design may have added the \"@\" sign to its collection in March, but the artfully looping symbol has yet to find any real foothold in the conversational realm.Look, it makes sense to add an @ to your name on Twitter, and Facebook now has a handy tagging feature that works with the addition of that particular keystroke, but referring to your friends as \"@Tom\" or \"@T-Bone\" in digital parlance such as e-mail or chat is just ... well ... redundant.

{"input": "Question: Who takes on role of Jason? </s> Context: LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Derek Mears has a big hockey mask to fill.Derek Mears arrives on the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of the new \"Friday the 13th\" movie.Mears was cast as the iconic boogeyman Jason Voorhees in the new \"Friday the 13th\" movie.A remake of the original 1980 film, the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious Camp Crystal Lake.Mears is no stranger to the horror genre, having co-starred in \"The Hills Have Eyes II.\" His career is extensive and includes stints as a stuntman in two of the popular \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films.He recently spoke to CNN about taking a turn as the ultimate evil, the thrill of continuing a slasher legacy and why he's really not that bloody nice.CNN: You aren't that scary in person, so what made you think you could be that scary on camera?Derek Mears: I've got a lot of issues. I've got a whole lot of daddy issues.No, I sound like a basket case. It's funny with acting -- we all wear masks in our normal life. Not to sound like a weirdo in the hockey mask, but like right now I'm really excited about the film and excited about playing the character, and I will start to speak faster.That's kind of what's coming over me: \"Oh you're, you're really nice,\" but ... on the other side of me there are other Dereks that are angry, and like I said before, have a little bit of issues.CNN: Tell me a little bit about how you were approached. Did you know they were making it before they came to you? Was it kind of a shock?Mears: It's so weird. There's two different versions. There's my version of how it went about, and there's the producer's version.I'll tell the producer's version because my version is really, really long. The short version of my version was I heard they were doing a new \"Friday the 13th,\" and I've never tried to pursue a role before and I went, I really want to do this.So when I heard they were doing it, before I even had an audition, I started training for it. I found out a little about what they wanted for the character -- that he wasn't going to be super, you know bulky or big, that he's more functional. He's still big, but he's lean. So I started training that way and trying to do what I could just to get an audition.On the other end, on the producer's end, they asked a bunch of different industry professionals. They said, \"Hey, were doing a new 'Friday the 13th.' Who do you think would be a great new Jason?\" And my name kept popping up, which I'm blown away by.They brought me in for an audition, and I met with them. and they called me the next day and went, \"OK, you're the guy.\" And I still don't believe it till this day. I'm blown away.CNN: How did you keep it light on the set?Mears: Believe it or not, all the actors ... got along so well. I have never been so close to a cast before on set. We were just goofing around and playing, but then when it's time to work and get serious with certain scenes, we'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to.CNN: Had you seen any of the original \"Friday the 13th\" movies?Mears: Oh yeah.

{"input": "Question: What did the new rules call for? </s> Context: Washington (CNN) -- A new classified directive to coalition forces in Afghanistan puts restrictions on nighttime raids of Afghan homes and compounds, according to a senior U.S. official who has seen the document.The official declined to be identified because a declassified version of the document has not been made public. The directive is signed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, the official said.The directive comes as the coalition seeks to reduce tension between its military forces and Afghan civilians in an effort to maintain Afghan public support.Nighttime raids in which troops enter private homes have sparked problems for U.S. and NATO forces. The raids are viewed as overly invasive -- a violation of the privacy of the home in Afghan culture -- and they can turn violent.The document orders forces to use Afghan troops at night \"whenever possible\" to knock on doors of residences and compounds, and to use them if forcible action is required for entry, the official said.But the directive also orders troops to \"conduct an analysis\" of whether it is militarily essential to conduct a raid at night or whether it can be put off until daylight, the official said. If troops can keep a target under surveillance but wait for daylight, they then can enlist the aid of village elders, perhaps, in determining if a home or compound poses a threat, the official said.The official emphasized that troops always have the right to defend themselves and are given leeway to use their best judgment on the battlefield.McChrystal also is updating another directive, first issued last year, on conducting operations to minimize civilian casualties, the official said.The updated version, which is yet to be published, will include \"more clarity\" for troops on how to operate in \"escalation of force\" incidents, such as when a vehicle approaches a checkpoint in a potentially threatening manner and troops must decide whether, and when, to fire at it. The official declined to offer further details but said the aim is to make sure even the most junior troops have full understanding of rules and procedures.Some troops and local commanders have expressed concerns that recent rules can inhibit their ability to take action under fire.These directives come as the coalition has been involved in several recent incidents in which civilians were inadvertently killed, and as the coalition conducts major operations in southern Afghanistan.McChrystal released a video message to the Afghan populace apologizing for an incident this week in which 27 Afghan civilians were killed.\"I have made it clear to our forces that we are here to protect the Afghan people. I pledge to strengthen our efforts to regain your trust to build a brighter future for all Afghans,\" he said in the message.The official said the documents may be made public in the coming weeks, after current operations ease.", "truth": ["restrictions"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-2866", "mistake": "restrictions on nighttime raids of Afghan homes and compounds", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.19999999999999998}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}
{"input": "Question: Who recounted details of Winehouse's last hours? </s> Context: London (CNN) -- Singer Amy Winehouse's death this summer was the result of alcohol poisoning, an inquest ruled Wednesday, as it reached a verdict of \"death by misadventure.\"A pathologist told a coroner's court in north London that alcohol toxicity was the cause of the 27-year-old's death, with her blood-alcohol levels measured at more than five times the legal limit for driving.The Grammy award-winning artist, who had battled with alcohol and drug abuse over several years, was found dead at her north London home July 23.Testimony at her inquest showed no traces of illegal drugs in Winehouse's system -- but more details emerged about her losing battle with alcohol.Winehouse's physician, Dr. Christina Romete, said she saw Winehouse at 7 p.m. the day before she died, when the singer was tipsy but still able to hold a conversation.Asked when she was going to stop drinking, Winehouse replied that she would call Romete over the weekend to discuss it, the physician said.Winehouse was determined to do things her own way, including therapy, Romete said, but was aware of the risks of alcohol abuse.The singer's personal security guard, Andrew Morris, said he last spoke to her at 2 a.m. on July 23. He said he looked in on her at 10 a.m. and saw her lying on her bed, but figured she was sleeping in, which wasn't unusual, the court heard.Morris said he realized something was wrong when he checked in again at 3 p.m. and saw Winehouse had not moved. She wasn't breathing and had no pulse, he said.Morris said the singer didn't \"drink to get drunk,\" but that he noticed she had started drinking alcohol again that week.Police who searched the flat after her death found three empty vodka bottles, the inquest heard.The pathologist's tests revealed that Winehouse's blood-alcohol level was 416 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol.The pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal.The verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved.A family statement, given by spokesman Chris Goodman, said: \"It is (with) some relief we finally found out what happened to Amy.\"We understand there was alcohol in her system when she passed away. It is likely a buildup of alcohol in her system over a number of days.\"The court heard that Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time. She had started drinking again that week after a period of abstinence,\" Goodman said.Winehouse's father Mitch and mother Janet were among those who packed the small courtroom at St. Pancras Coroners Court to hear the evidence from key witnesses.Her family set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation last month to raise money to help young people in Britain and elsewhere, especially those suffering the effects of ill health, disability, poverty and addiction.Goodman said the ruling \"underlines how important our work with the Amy Winehouse Foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name.\"Winehouse's family said in August that toxicology tests had found that \"no illegal substances\" were in her system at the time of her death but alcohol was present.The singer's soulful, throaty vocals brought her stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her top 10 hit \"Rehab\" -- won her notoriety.Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia.The tattooed London-born singer-songwriter's first album, \"Frank,\" debuted in 2003, when she was 19.International success", "truth": ["Andrew Morris,"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-3065", "mistake": "Andrew Morris", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "pass"}
{"input": "Question: where does the train take skiers to ? </s> Context: (CNN) -- Many skiers who visit Colorado prefer the slopes of Aspen, Vail or Breckenridge. But there's a cool little day trip from Denver that often gets overlooked by out-of-towners.The Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado.The Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later.The 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way, and many riders say it's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70.A roundtrip ticket costs between $49 and $85. There are additional expenses, such as parking at the train station in Denver and lift tickets for skiers. If someone chooses to shop instead of ski, a free shuttle into Winter Park is available.Train riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet. It also travels through almost 30 tunnels, including the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which passes underneath the Continental Divide.\"The train ride up there is spectacular. You see wonderful vistas as you leave Denver through the northern plains and into the mountains,\" Kristal Kraft, a real estate agent in Denver, says. \"And once you get through the Moffat Tunnel, you're right there at Winter Park.\"Kraft says she enjoyed her maiden voyage on the train, which came courtesy of a local home builder that bought group tickets in one of the club cars.\"I loved the convenience [of the train],' she says. \"We relaxed, talked, socialized. And when you get off the train, you are right there at the slopes.\"According to skitrain.com, three additional cars are available for charter and one for company retreats. The Web site lists the price for the presentation car at $5,000 for a winter trip. The site says the current train cars were purchased after Ansco Investment Company bought the Ski Train in 1988.Kraft says the cars are comfortably heated and there is ample room to move around. Kraft, an amateur photography buff, enjoyed switching from window to window, side to side, to take pictures.There is one occasional hitch to riding the train. It shares the track with the Union Pacific Railroad and at times has to stop or pullover to make way for a freight train or Amtrak. And there are instances where another train has an accident.One time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain.They called the passengers together in a cafeteria in Winter Park and advised them to call friends and family to come pick them up. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m.It was a worst-case scenario, he says, and it only happened once. There are occasional delays of a few hours.The bad news is you're delayed; the good news is you're on a full service train with food service and restrooms. And there's the ability to find a beverage.One reviewer on the Web site yelp.com said there's another bonus to the train.\"What's great is that once you get back into Denver you can hit Wynkoop brewery or any other bars around there to keep the party rolling,\" Ramon G. wrote.", "truth": ["between Denver and Winter Park."], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1487", "mistake": "The Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.3}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

Lawrence Township police had levied a $100 fine against an official from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers because of Scabby.The court concluded that while townships have a right to maintain an \"aesthetic environment\" and ensure public safety, its restrictions on expressive displays \"do not justify a content-based restriction of non-commercial speech.\"\"There is no evidence to suggest that a rat balloon is significantly more harmful to aesthetics or safety than a similar item being displayed as an advertisement or commercial logo,\" wrote Justice John Wallace Jr.The balloon and others like it, nicknamed Scabby by the Chicago-based company that made them, have been used by labor unions as street theater since 1990 to protest anti-union activities.IBEW members were marching on the sidewalk outside Gold's Gym in Lawrence Township in April 2005 in response to a dispute with a contractor working at the business.A police officer had ordered the balloon deflated, but returned an hour later to find it blown back up. The labor official in charge admitted he ordered the rat reinflated, and he was given a summons.Lower state courts had ruled the township's ordinance was content-neutral and did not suppress the union's ability to spread its message, since members still could chant and distribute handbills to the public.About 200 Scabby balloons are used by labor unions nationwide, according to Big Sky Balloons.

Watch a search of the rapper's home \u00bbHe was held in federal custody over the weekend.Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon.Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past.However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that \"a number of people\" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were \"two sides to every story -- sometimes three\" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor.The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped.Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards.The show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest.Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\"At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet.\"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.\"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\"The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement.The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said.The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said.On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said.Harris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said.Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation.\"Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,\" according to an affidavit.", "truth": ["Harris"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1238", "mistake": "T.I.", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

Earlier this year, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions.Public Citizen said Tuesday it was \"pleased\" with the FDA's order but added \"there is still more that the FDA must do.\"\"The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions, such as tendon pain, so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture,\" the group said. \"We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures.\"When asked about the lawsuit and why it didn't order the \"black box\" label warning until now, Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004, and updated the information last year.  Dr. Gupta explains more on antibiotic risks \u00bb\"There has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products,\" Cox said. \"We have been working on this issue and making progress over time.\"The companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the FDA or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary, Cox said.Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., which holds licenses for Cipro and Avelox, said it would make the changes requested by the FDA but defended the drugs as \"well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications.\" Schering-Plough markets Cipro and Avelox in the United States under agreement with Bayer.Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which markets Levaquin in the United States, also said it would abide by the FDA's request.Merck & Co., the maker of Noroxin, said it, too, would update the drug's label. But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form.Oscient Pharmaceuticals (Factive), Daiichi Sankyo (Floxin) and Dipomed (Proquin) did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.The fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times, according to the FDA's Dr. Renata Albrecht.\"This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy,\" the FDA said in a statement.Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon.\"Sometimes it's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning,\" she said.Normally, she added, that patients experience some pain or inflammation \"a week or two before the patient will rupture.\"Public Citizen, founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007.\"Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA, the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher,\" the group said", "truth": ["Cipro"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1810", "mistake": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a \"black box\" label warning", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

When Orlean told people she was planning to write a biography of Rin Tin Tin, the German shepherd portrayed in movies and on TV, even her friends were puzzled. \"Whaaat?\" many of them said. Sara Nelson talked with Orlean about how and why she spent eight years on the trail of one of the world's most famous canines.Oprah.com: One man, one mission -- rescuing muttsQ. The book is titled \"Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend\" [Simon & Schuster], but it's really about the several dogs that played him. Much like \"The Orchid Thief,\" it's also about obsession.A: I think I'm often drawn, whether I realize it or not, to the idea of what drives people. What do we love? Orchids have been a source of passion since the beginning of time. Rin Tin Tin has been beloved and admired and dreamed about for nearly a hundred years. The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over.Oprah.com: 33 fall must-readsQ. One of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about Nazi Germany, the 1950s, your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of \"Rinty.\" Why did you construct the book this way?A: I think writing a book is very much a performance. I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s. I just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way I did when I was writing.Q. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin?A: Either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years, I guess! -- or the exact opposite: that there was no real dog, just a character.Oprah.com: Middle-school girls give stray dogs a second chanceQ. Were you surprised by how emotionally attached you got to the story?A: What has always fascinated me and what's very emotional to me is the question of what lasts. People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody.

But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds.They gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway.That leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters.No, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of \"Up\" \u00bbSuch misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, \"Up\" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials.There's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes.And there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or \"Wilderness Explorer\" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around?\"Up\" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs.But if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth.Russell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm, haplessly helpful. He's the mirror image of the child Carl used to be, if only the old man were capable of recognizing it.But instead of looking around him, Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com: Share your review of \"Up\"Written by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- \"Up\" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance. The balance isn't quite as tight as in Pixar's best movies, but the lightness is appealing, and Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) is an irresistible character. He's already carrying his own emotional baggage at 8 years old, but he's all heart, the kind to give kids a good name.Screening in 3-D where possible, \"Up\" doesn't go overboard on stereoscopic gimmickry, but does exploit depth of field in a string of exhilarating cliffhangers and dogfights.Funny and poignant and full of life, \"Up\" easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far.

While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not.Here, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the \"Golden City,\" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks.CNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague.Petra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was \"wow.\"I was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience.The following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent.CNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words?Petra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the \"golden city,\" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush.I think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.In five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.CNN: What was your childhood like?Petra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.We didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.And the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit.

He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt.He then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" he said.Shopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe \u00bb\"There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,\" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible.There are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards.Should these private security guards be armed? \"Absolutely not,\" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in \"the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight.\"\"These random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur. Law enforcement and security prevention measures, no matter how good, cannot forestall a tragedy such as this from happening,\" said a statement issued Wednesday night by the Simon Property Group, which operates regional and outlet malls across the United States.\"We do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time, some of which are visible to the public, with others intentionally less noticeable,\" the statement said. \"Disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment.\"Security expert Lou Palumbo told CNN one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall.\"You start to observe the people coming into the mall area,\" he said. \"To let them in your door and then try to figure out what they're doing, you know, it's not as effective as catching them as they're coming in the door.\"The International Council of Shopping Centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter \"airport style\" security measures, including bag checks and magnetometers.According to Kavanaugh, the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level, red. Such extreme measures are \"in the mall industry playbook ... but it is something no one wants to do,\" said Kavanaugh.While some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done.

The employee was a dual Italian-Iraqi national, the Italian Foreign Ministry said.The U.S. military said the blast struck a meeting of a district advisory council, a neighborhood group that looks at local needs and passes on its assessments to the provincial government.The deputy head of the council was seriously injured, the Interior Ministry official said.The U.S. military blamed Iranian-backed militants it calls Special Groups for the blast and detained three people in connection with the attack, including a suspect \"fleeing the scene [who] tested positive for explosive residue.\"\"We believe the target of the attack was a high-ranking [district advisory council] member as well as the U.S. soldiers,\" said Lt.

The crowd was orderly, and there had been no reports of major incidents or concerns.FBI spokesman Jason Pack said there had been no arrests related to the inauguration so far. FBI and partner agencies investigated about a dozen reports of suspicious incidents or people, but none was anything serious.About 957 people visited the medical tents on the mall for various first-aid needs.Some security screening lines ran slowly, officials said, but there had not been any major systemic problems.Earlier in the day, federal officials were reviewing an unspecified threat to disrupt the inauguration, according to the Department of Homeland Security.The FBI was investigating two \"streams of intelligence\" suggesting that Somalia-based terrorist organization Al Shabaab may have been plotting an attack timed to coincide with the event, the FBI and Homeland Security said in a joint threat advisory obtained by CNN.Security officials made some readjustments to inauguration security as a precaution and did not change the threat level, an administration official said.The ceremony went off without incident.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice designated al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" in February.The State Department calls it \"a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda.

Already this month 11 people have been killed by lightning in the U.S.The same week, a 33-year-old man was struck while jogging in Texas, a 70-year-old California woman was hit while doing yard work and a Kentucky man, 44, fell victim while waiting under a tree for a ride.They are among 11 people killed already this month by lightning strikes in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.\"Lightning is very random in terms of fatalities,\" National Weather Service lightning safety expert John Jensensius told CNN. \"We normally see a good amount of lightning in June, but this is unusually high. There really is no good explanation of why that's the case.\"Six of the 15 lightning-strike deaths in the U.S. so far this year occurred in California, Texas and Florida, with the rest scattered through the South, Midwest and West. No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, \"likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England,\" Jensensius said. \"There have been less severe thunderstorms there.\"Summer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. This week, the first official week of summer, marks \"Lightning Safety Awareness Week\" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The agency's message is \"When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors.\" That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors. Taking shelter under trees offers little safety -- nearly one-third of the people killed by lightning last year were under a tree when they were hit.More than 400 people in the U.S. are hit by lightning each year, according to the National Weather Service. Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more). While not all injuries result in death, many victims are left with devastating and permanent disabilities.You may remember that as a child you were told to count the seconds between a lightning flash and thunder to see how far away the lightning was. But by the time you calculate it, it may be too late.

The pope addressed the crisis that has rocked the Irish Catholic Church in an 18-page pastoral letter, which was made public Saturday.Critics said the pope did not go far enough in the letter.The acceptance of Magee's resignation came only days after the pope's letter was published.The leader of Ireland's Roman Catholics, Cardinal Sean Brady, wished Magee well in a statement, but said he had to focus on the victims of abuse.\"Foremost in my thoughts in these days are those who have suffered abuse by clergy and those who feel angry and let down by the often inadequate response of leaders in the Church,\" said Brady, who has himself come under fire for failing to report what he learned during an investigation into a priest who became one of Ireland's most notorious child abusers.Brady was part of an internal Church investigation into Father Brendan Smyth in 1975. He did not report his findings to the police and asked two teenagers who gave him evidence to sign oaths of secrecy.In the past five years, Ireland's Catholic Church has had three separate outside investigations into child abuse -- both sexual and physical -- by priests, nuns, and staff at Catholic-run institutions such as schools and orphanages.Four bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the most recent, the Murphy Report, which found a widespread tendency to cover up child abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin between 1975 and 2004.Only one of those resignations has been accepted -- that of Bishop Donal Murray on December 17.The resignation of Bishop Magee is not related to any of the recent statutory reports, said Patsy McGarry, religious affairs correspondent for the Irish Times newspaper.Instead, it is rooted in an internal church report on child protection practices in his Cloyne diocese in southern Ireland.In 2008 the Catholic Church's own child protection watchdog, the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland conducted an audit of child protection practices in every diocese in Ireland, McGarry explained.It found those to be \"inadequate, and in some respects dangerous\" in Cloyne diocese.Its findings were published in December 2008, prompting calls for Magee to resign.Magee did not resign, but he was effectively stripped of his authority in March 2009, when Archbishop Dermot Clifford of the neighboring diocese of Cashel and Emly was appointed \"apostolic administrator\" of Cloyne diocese.The Murphy Commission -- which produced the report into the Dublin archdiocese -- is now investigating Cloyne diocese, McGarry said.

What do you think that means?Fareed Zakaria: That's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether Iran has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons. We know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites.But it has always seemed as though there were two views within the Iranian leadership. One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons. ...This would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out. We don't know for sure because this is all guesswork frankly. ...CNN: What's happening with the negotiations?Zakaria: The Iranians have been playing a very peculiar negotiating game where they sometimes seem interested in negotiating but rarely do they actually engage in good faith. ... They rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they're playing games.CNN: What's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions?Zakaria: It probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with Iran and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere. I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime, which seems to be most powerful faction. And that's the right approach to take. We know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average Iranian, and that is entirely counterproductive.CNN: What's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside Iran, including the protest movement?Zakaria: Nobody knows for sure, but it does seem to have confused the situation internally. [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue, which were then attacked by the opposition, and he retracted it, which suggests that he's feeling the pressure. It suggests that there are divisions within the regime, there's some sense of vulnerability. ... It just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them, but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in Iran.CNN: What do you think about the military option?Zakaria: The problems with the military option remain what they've always been, and it's a little alarming to", "truth": ["Iran could be secretly working on a nuclear weapon"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-730", "mistake": "It probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with Iran and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.11764705882352941}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

The man was refused citizenship because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered, Besson said.The decision, made Tuesday, came exactly a week after a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.The ban -- which has not yet come up for a vote -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, the commission announced.Foreigners may become French citizens if they marry French nationals and meet certain criteria, including integrating well in French society and having \"good morality,\" Besson said. It is on the criteria of morality that the man's citizenship request was denied, Besson said.\"This individual imposes the full veil upon his wife, does not allow her the freedom to go and come as she pleases, and bans her from going out with her face unveiled, and rejects the principles of secularism and equality between man and woman,\" Besson said he told President Nicolas Sarkozy.France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request in 2008 on the grounds that she wore a burqa.Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers six months ago that the traditional Muslim burqa was \"not welcome\" in France. He said the issue is one of a woman's freedom and dignity, and did not have to do with religion.France has relatively tight controls on religion, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It has among the most severe government restrictions on religion in Western Europe, as well as some of the highest levels of social tension involving religion, Pew senior researcher Brian Grim told CNN.More than half of French people support a full ban veils, according to a recent opinion poll. The Ipsos poll for Le Point magazine found 57 percent of French people said it should be illegal to appear in public wearing clothes that cover the face.That's despite government estimates that fewer than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil.France has about 3.5 million Muslims, representing about 6 percent of the population, according to Pew Forum research.

{"input": "Question: What did his wife say? </s> Context: Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Pop superstar Rihanna has been ordered to cover up by a Christian farmer who took exception to her \"inappropriate behavior\" while filming a music video on his land.The controversy has erupted in Northern Ireland and was even discussed Tuesday by lawmakers in the province's elected Assembly in Belfast.Rihanna, who was born in Barbados but has Irish ancestry, is in Northern Ireland this week for sold-out shows at Belfast's Odyssey Arena.The 23-year-old had been given permission to film a video for the song \"We Found Love\" in a muddy barley field owned by farmer Alan Graham outside Bangor, about 10 miles from Belfast.Graham explained Tuesday, \"I didn't know who was coming. If the name 'Rihanna' had been mentioned, well, no disrespect, but it wouldn't have meant anything.\"However, he says that when he went to get his tractor Monday and saw the singer stripping down to a bikini top, he stepped in to end the shoot.The local political representative said he \"asked the film crew to stop, and they did.\"Graham insisted that \"there were no hard feelings.\"He added: \"I had a conversation with Rihanna; we shook hands; we parted company on good terms. I found her very gracious, and I hope she understands where I'm coming from. I wish her well.\"Word had quickly spread of Rihanna's surprise appearance in the Northern Irish countryside, and traffic came to a standstill as fans attempted to catch a glimpse of the star.Graham's wife shed more light on the incident Tuesday, revealing that Rihanna had gone topless.Said Mrs. Graham, who declined to give her first name, \"What she was doing became more inappropriate. When she started to go topless, that's what Alan was particularly objecting to -- things were getting out of hand. There was a man as well, and the behavior was getting more inappropriate. ... It wasn't the sort of thing Alan wanted young people (those watching) to see on his land. We are Christians.\"However, Mrs. Graham added: \"The girl was very nice; she shook hands with Alan several times\" after he asked for the filming to stop.Not to be deterred, Rihanna was back filming again in Belfast on Tuesday.But the controversy of the sexy shoot in the barley field rumbled on -- and even made it onto the agenda at the Northern Ireland Assembly.Graham is a local representative with the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (formerly led by Protestant preacher the Rev. Ian Paisley), and the Rihanna row led to a light-hearted exchange between lawmakers in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday.Mike Nesbitt, of rival pro-British party the Ulster Unionists, addressed Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland's first minister.Nesbitt said, \"I wonder if the first minister has had an opportunity to assess the potential damage from the news that the pop icon Rihanna was foiled in her filming ambitions yesterday, which I believe were no more sinister than appearing in a field in red, white and blue.\" (The latter are the colors of the British flag as well as the American one).Robinson replied, \"I'm pretty sure there was no problem with the colors involved!\"Robinson had just been telling the Assembly of his recent trade mission to the United States to encourage Hollywood studios to make more movies in Northern Ireland.", "truth": ["Alan was particularly objecting to"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-3092", "mistake": "gone topless", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year, which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win.Earlier this month, the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption, fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki's political arch rival.

What about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up? Did it all kind of work together?Ware: It does work together. But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.What it's been is the segregation of Baghdad into these enclaves. It's been cutting a deal with Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Iranian-backed militia.

Government records show that the camp's water was contaminated for three decades.Although the Marine Corps contends that two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses, the men facing a debilitating and possibly lethal disease don't believe it.Partain said his illness has been been a \"traumatic, emotional and physical\" ordeal for his family.Two North Carolina senators -- Richard Burr, the ranking Republican on the committee, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat who is not a panel member -- are pushing legislation that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover the medical costs of Marines and their families who were exposed to the contaminated water.The provision, which has passed the Senate, would amend the Defense Appropriations Bill to prohibit the Navy from \"disposing of water-contamination claims before critical scientific studies can be completed.\"According to Hagan, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is conducting human health and water modeling studies to determine whether the toxic water contributed to health problems at the base.Some of the water was contaminated with toxins at concentrations up to 280 times what is currently considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, Hagan said.

The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over.Oprah.com: 33 fall must-readsQ. One of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about Nazi Germany, the 1950s, your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of \"Rinty.\" Why did you construct the book this way?A: I think writing a book is very much a performance. I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s. I just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way I did when I was writing.Q. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin?A: Either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years, I guess! -- or the exact opposite: that there was no real dog, just a character.Oprah.com: Middle-school girls give stray dogs a second chanceQ. Were you surprised by how emotionally attached you got to the story?A: What has always fascinated me and what's very emotional to me is the question of what lasts. People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody. I feel great tenderness toward the people who devoted themselves to Rin Tin Tin and his history because I think everybody wants to have had their existence noted by the universe.Oprah.com: 5 books everyone should read at least onceQ. Okay, in the great \"Stones or Beatles?\" tradition, tell us: Are you a Rinty person or a Lassie person?A: I think you can love both dogs, even if you have an allegiance to one. I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world. Maybe they represented opposite ends of a spectrum -- Lassie was about love and nurture, Rin Tin Tin about", "truth": ["to the idea of"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1567", "mistake": "the idea of what drives people", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.5}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

{"input": "Question: what percentage burns did Brewer suffer? </s> Context: Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN)  -- Three teens accused of setting a 15-year-old friend on fire pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said.Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16, are charged as adults with one count of attempted murder in the second degree in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida.They were arraigned in Broward County Circuit Court before Judge Dale Cohen and are being held without bond.Two other boys ages 13 and 15 have been charged as juveniles.Prosecutors say Jarvis, Bent and Mendez were in a gang that poured alcohol over Michael Brewer, 15, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.Brewer jumped into the swimming pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames, witnesses say.Brewer suffered burns over 65 percent of his body. He's reported in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center, where he's been in a private room since the incident.Gordon Weekes, the attorney for Bent, denounced the fact that the teens were charged as adults.\"It's been decided by society that a 15-year-old can't vote, can't join the armed forces and cannot buy alcohol, because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long-term consequences of their actions,\" he said.\"But they can treat them as adults in court, when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system, which is geared toward rehabilitation,\" he said.Weekes said he and the other two public defenders plan to make separate motions to the court asking that their clients be allowed to post bond.Detectives say witnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him. They said Matthew Bent encouraged the attack.Authorities say Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a \"bad decision,\" according to an arrest transcript.Detectives with the Broward County Sheriff's Office have been unable to interview Brewer. Until last week, he had been on a ventilator to keep him alive.\"We hope that we can maybe get a statement this week,\" said sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal.\"Detectives have been waiting for him to recover to the point where he's strong enough to give us a complete statement,\" he said.Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections. Most of his burns are on his back and buttocks; his face and hands were largely spared, doctors say.Brewer's doctor told CNN the teen faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries.\"They still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting, but his parents are with him all the time,\" said Lorraine Nelson, a hospital spokeswoman.\"I don't tell him what happened,\" Brewer's mother, Valerie, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. \"I just tell him he's in the hospital and he's safe and he's getting better.\"And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?' And I say 'Yes, Michael. You're going to be fine. You're going to be just fine,' \" she said.Investigators believe Brewer owed Bent $40 for a video game. When Brewer did not pay, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle, police say. When Brewer reported him to the police, Bent was arrested.The next day, the group surrounded Brewer. The five boys called Brewer \"a snitch\" and set him on fire, witnesses said.The Brewer family told WFOR that none of the families of the accused boys have tried to contact them, but it doesn't matter.\"We can't focus on it.

Successfully completed sections disappear. The more sections the player completes without reaching the top, the higher the score. iReport: 25 years of TetrisSteadily, the game worked its way around the world.

Page Museum.Zed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles. An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth's skull, according to project director Christopher Shaw.\"The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper,\" Shaw told CNN Thursday. \"We don't know just how smashed up it is, but it's fairly intact because it's a huge jacket we put it around.\"The mammoth's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"tree-boxed\" along with the surrounding dirt, creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact. Zed's remains were encased in a plaster jacket.The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones.Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum, who began analyzing the various fossils in June, Shaw said.\"It's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years,\" Shaw said.John Harris, the head curator of the Page Museum, publicly announced the finding of \"a whole new treasure trove of fossils\" on Wednesday. He described it as \"the most important discovery\" for the museum \"of the last 90 years.\"Shaw said the announcement was made to \"create interest\" in the museum's discovery.Among the most interesting items is likely to be Zed, who is believed to have died in his late 40s. Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years.Not all of Zed's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed.\"Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated, including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis, one tusk and the lower jaw,\" Shaw said. \"It will take another six to 12 months to open everything.\"Shaw said both of Zed's tusks were found intact, which is very rare.\"Previously, we've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved,\" Shaw said. \"It's very exciting to us to have these two complete, beautifully preserved tusks.\"The excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum's attendance and funding, which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession.\"The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the 'fishbowl' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned,\" Shaw said. \"So people come to see us and we've constructed small exhibits.

{"input": "Question: What does de FAA says about the policy? </s> Context: Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is changing a generations-old policy banning pilots from taking antidepressants, saying the new policy will improve safety by bringing to the surface pilots who either ignore signs of depression or lie about their use of medication for fear of losing their licenses to fly.Beginning Monday, pilots with mild to moderate depression will be allowed to fly while taking antidepressants if they can demonstrate they have been satisfactorily treated for at least 12 months.The FAA also will begin a six-month amnesty period, during which pilots who use antidepressants can step forward without fear of penalties. The pilots will be grounded until they can demonstrate they have been stable for a year, although those who can prove a history of successful medical treatment should be able to fly \"within a few months,\" the FAA said.The new policy will \"absolutely\" improve safety, said Randy Babbitt, head of the FAA and a former airline pilot and union chief.\"The concern that we have today is we have people who are either self-medicating or not seeking a diagnosis. Either of those is unacceptable,\" Babbitt said. \"This change ... will allow those people to get the treatment, allow us to monitor and return them to the cockpit [as] safer, better pilots.\"FAA officials said that they do not know the extent of depression among pilots but that pilots are probably representative of the larger population, in which 10 percent are believed to suffer from depression.Nor does the FAA know how many pilots have removed themselves from flying status because they suffer from depression, a condition that now bars them from flying. Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy.Commercial pilots under the age of 40 are required to undergo a medical exam by an FAA-certified physician every year; those over 40, every six months. But the examination focuses largely on the pilots' physical health, and there is no formal assessment of the pilots' mental health.The FAA says pilots have a regulatory duty and professional responsibility to not fly if they know they have a physical or mental condition that makes them unsafe to fly.But the FAA concedes pilots aren't always forthcoming, especially if honesty could cost them their job.\"We know that there are people out there who are not taking antidepressants because they know they would be grounded if they are. We know there are people out there who are taking them and lying to us about that,\" said Dr. Fred Tilton, the FAA's federal air surgeon.\"We think it's safer to [make sure pilots are treated for depression] than to continue to drive it underground,\" he said.Under the new policy, the FAA will, on a case-by-case basis, issue special medical certificates to pilots who take one of four antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro).All four drugs can be used safely without side effects, the FAA said, and other medications will be considered as the agency gains experience and data under its new policy.FAA officials say that they have been studying the issue for a decade, and that the change comes with improvements in medication and as the stigma of depression has diminished.One of the concerns is the risk of suicide by airplane.Between 1993 and 2002, there were 16 \"aircraft-assisted suicides,\" according to a National Transportation Safety Board report, as recounted in a recent FAA medical bulletin. All involved smaller aircraft.In addition, the NTSB ruled that in 1999, the pilot caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 by forcing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean, although the board could not determine the pilot's motives and did not use the term \"suicide.\"The pilot's medical certificate had been renewed 10 days before the crash.

Stanley McChrystal, wants 40,000 more pairs of boots on the ground.Initial reports about the cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over President Hamid Karzai's government.Neither Eikenberry nor the White House would comment on the contents of private advice between the envoy and the president, but the reports alarmed Karzai enough that his office sought confirmation from the U.S. Embassy about them, a Karzai spokesman told CNN.Karzai's office did not get the information it sought, the spokesman said.Whatever Eikenberry told the president, the ambassador is unusually well versed in the military problems facing Afghanistan.He retired from the Army after nearly 40 years of service with the rank of lieutenant general on April 28 -- one day before he was sworn in as ambassador, according to his State Department biography.His long military career included time in Kabul as U.S. security coordinator and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.\"Afghanistan has been at the center of my career since 9/11, when the terrorist-commandeered aircraft crashed into the Pentagon just below the office in which I was working,\" Eikenberry said at his Senate confirmation hearing in March.\"There is no silver bullet and no quick, cheap or easy solutions. There is no substitute for more resources and sacrifice,\" he said then.But, he added: \"There is no exclusively military solution to the issues we and our partners confront in Afghanistan.\"He also advised the U.S. secretary of defense on China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mongolia, and was deputy director for strategy, plans and policy on the Army staff.But he's not new to embassy life, having served as defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China.Eikenberry has a master's degree in east Asian studies from Harvard, an advanced degree in Chinese history from Nanjing University in China, and is a certified translator from Mandarin Chinese.He's also clearly attached to his wife, Ching, insisting in his Senate confirmation hearing that she accompany him to Kabul even though State Department rules barred spouses because the country is so dangerous.He prevailed.

Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier.On the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested.Mohler told police he \"was aware of what was going on in Missouri,\" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office.Five members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an \"associate\" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said.The six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims.Police did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run.Darrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47.More charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system.Alumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an \"associate\" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released.The alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said.Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement.Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children.Mohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but \"his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,\" the statement said.Some lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth.The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Investigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday.

The patient received her new face in one graft from a donor cadaver.\"I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world,\" Siemionow said.  Watch an animation of the face transplant \u00bbThe patient had previously \"suffered severe facial trauma,\" the Cleveland Clinic said. She had no nose, right eye or upper jaw before the procedure, and could not smell or eat normally. People would call her names on the street, Siemionow said.The surgery gave the patient a nose with nasal lining, as well as a palate. This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said.Social reincorporation is as important as the face transplant itself, Siemionow said. At this point, the patient doesn't want to face the \"common world,\" but she is facing her family, the surgeon said.The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said. She can also taste a hamburger and pizza, and drink coffee from a cup, the \"things we take for granted every day,\" Siemionow said.The patient also received lower eyelids, upper lip, skin, muscles, bone, hard palate, arteries, veins and nerves.As for the aesthetics of the new face, Siemionow suggested that restoring function was more important. \"At this point, no one is really looking at beautification,\" she said.Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.Only patients who had already exhausted all possible options for conventional repair were considered for the transplant, Siemionow said.Currently, cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because  transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue, Siemionow said. In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said.While burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said.Previously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China. The Chinese recipient, Li Guoxing, died in July of unknown causes, Guo Shuzhong, a doctor involved in the case, confirmed to CNN.One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. The other French patient had been bitten by a dog. The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear.European news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant, which would be the fifth in the world.Researchers are also making headway into treatments for disorders that give rise to facial abnormalities, experts say.

The following day, he, like all deploying soldiers, reported to the \"ready room\" on post to fill out final paperwork.However, what was to be another day of the mundane erupted into hell on Earth.Burnette heard shots, though that's a sound to which soldiers grow accustomed. He had been hearing blanks for many months of training.But on November 5 at Fort Hood, he quickly understood that something was terribly wrong when he saw the blood -- crimson everywhere.\"Seeing bullet wounds in the back of a friend's head, seeing friends grabbing their arms, and blood just everywhere. It's a pretty hard thing to see,\" Burnette recalled.\"And not having any way to defend yourself.\"The gunman had been in the room for a while and had perfectly blended in with his Army combat uniform, his gold major rank emblazoned on his chest. No one had reason to pay him heed, Burnette said.When the madness began, the gunman popped up like a target at a shooting range. He just stood up and started firing methodically and with precision.He reloaded. And fired. Reloaded. And fired again.\"He was very swift, very tactical,\" said Burnette, sitting in a wheelchair at the Metroplex Adventist Hospital near Fort Hood, his left arm and hand bandaged.The mass shooting last week was the deadliest ever on a U.S. military base. Twelve soldiers and one civilian were killed; more than 40 others were wounded.Fifteen soldiers remained hospitalized on Wednesday, four in intensive care, according to Fort Hood spokesman Col. James Rossi.They were victims of a soldier who turned on his own, authorities say.Burnette saw the laser sights on the gunman's weapon. The shooter looked serious, intent. He screamed at the top of his lungs, \"Allahu akbar,\" which means 'God is great' in Arabic.Burnette dropped to the floor, hugging the ground for dear life. His mind was spinning. What insanity was this?\"Once I saw the blood, I realized I had to move,\" he said. \"I had to get out of there.\"Burnette began to stand up and noticed the gunman was pointing in his direction. He picked up a folding table next to him -- it was the heaviest object he could see -- and hurled it toward the shooter.

More than 120 groups across six continents are holding vegan bake sales from April 24 through May 2.Bake sale participants see the sweet treats as a way to introduce those unfamiliar with a vegan diet to some of the flavorful foods they can eat.While vegetarians stay away from meat but may consume dairy and eggs, vegans give up all animal products.Some people become vegan for animal welfare reasons. Others view it as a way to reduce their carbon footprint. Still others choose the plant-based diet as part of a healthier lifestyle.Ruxandra Costescu, of Bucharest, Romania, said most attendees at the bake sales she helped organize weren't vegan.One person who showed up couldn't decide what he wanted, so he took one of everything, she said, adding that he came back later to buy more of his favorites for his family.\"It's really nice to have people who eat anything really appreciate the vegan treats,\" Costescu said. \"Usually people are amazed that they're so tasty.\"In Sydney, Australia, Amanda Salles was inspired to start regularly holding vegan bake sales after joining the first worldwide bake sale last year.She has never gone to an animal rights rally, but she tries to make a difference by baking vegan desserts like gingerbread cookies.\"I know a lot of people probably think it's not enough or that you should be going to protests or demonstrations,\" she said. \"But it's a good way to participate. It's not very aggressive.\"Some approaches to vegan outreach are less subtle. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has had half-naked activists campaign against meat consumption by covering themselves in fake blood and lying in human-sized meat packages.PETA's theatrics may seem a far cry from a bake sale, but the organization sees the sales and protests as means of reaching the same goal.\"Even if [people] don't like the medium that we're using to get things across, we really just try to make sure they understand why we're doing it,\" said PETA senior campaigner Ashley Byrne.Gary Loewenthal, director of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale, said he believes bake sales can be a nice change of pace for people used to more confrontational forms of activism.\"I liked it because it combined this time-honored, well-liked tradition with vegan outreach,\" he said.He started planning last year's event from his home in Falls Church, Virginia, after brainstorming fundraising opportunities with Compassion for Animals, the animal advocacy group he helps run.Loewenthal sent invitations to cities all over the world and soon generated a buzz online. In 2009, the event had close to 100 participants and raised more than $25,000.Each group decides where to direct the proceeds of its own bake sale. While the money is not required to go to any specific type of organization, many opt to donate to nonprofit groups.Two events in Seattle, Washington, last week raised $1,770 for Pigs Peace Sanctuary, where Edgar, a potbellied pig, is being treated for a broken leg.Funds from a vegan bake sale in California on Sunday will benefit breast cancer research and education through the Avon Foundation. A group in Louisiana will send its proceeds to Food For Life, a vegan hunger-relief organization.When Loewenthal started researching vegan bake sales in 2008, a Google search yielded few results.

Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category.Then there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French .Paul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots.

I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues.The development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records.\"The fact that kite boards have developed has helped ... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records,\" the spokesman said.He said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work.\"It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right,\" he said.The spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008.

And his Japanese ex-wife -- a fugitive in the United States for taking his children from Tennessee -- is considered the victim.\"Japan is an important partner and friend of the U.S., but on this issue, our points of view differ,\" the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said Tuesday. \"Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. Parental child abduction is not considered a crime in Japan.\"The story begins in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, with the January divorce of Savoie from his first wife, Noriko, a Japanese native. The ex-wife had agreed to live in Franklin to be close to the children, taking them to Japan for summer vacations.Savoie in March requested a restraining order to prevent his ex-wife from taking the children to Japan, saying she had threatened to do so, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate WTVF and posted on the station's Web site. A temporary order was issued, but then lifted following a hearing.\"If Mother fails to return to Tennessee [after summer vacation] with the children following her visitation period, she could lose her alimony, child support and education fund, which is added assurance to Father that she is going to return with the children,\" Circuit Court Judge James G. Martin III noted in his order on the matter.After that ruling, Christopher Savoie tried to have Martin recuse himself, as he was a mediator in the case prior to becoming a judge, said Marlene Eskind Moses, Noriko Savoie's attorney. But that request was denied, as Savoie earlier said he had no concerns about Martin hearing the matter.Following the summer trip, Noriko Savoie did return to the United States, and Christopher Savoie then took the children on a vacation, returning them to his ex-wife, his attorney, Paul Bruno, told CNN.  Watch latest report on Savoie's situation \u00bbBut days later, on the first day of classes for 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca, the school called Savoie to say his children hadn't arrived, Bruno said. Police checked Noriko Savoie's home and did not find the children.Concerned, Savoie called his ex-wife's father in Japan, who told him not to worry.\"I said, 'What do you mean -- don't worry? They weren't at school.' 'Oh, don't worry, they are here,' \" Savoie recounted the conversation to CNN affiliate WTVF earlier this month. \"I said, 'They are what, they are what, they are in Japan?' \"The very thing that Savoie had predicted in court papers had happened -- his wife had taken their children to Japan and showed no signs of returning, Bruno said.After Noriko Savoie took the children to Japan, Savoie filed for and received full custody of the children, Bruno said. And Franklin police issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife, the television station reported.But there was a major hitch: Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on international child abduction. The international agreement standardizes laws, but only among participating countries.So while Japanese civil law stresses that courts resolve custody issues based on the best interest of the children without regard to either parent's nationality, foreign parents have had little success in regaining custody.Japanese family law follows a tradition of sole custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children.In court documents filed", "truth": ["Christopher Savoie"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-2806", "mistake": "Christopher Savoie", "score": {"EM": 1, "QA-F1": 1.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "pass"}

The patient received her new face in one graft from a donor cadaver.\"I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world,\" Siemionow said.  Watch an animation of the face transplant \u00bbThe patient had previously \"suffered severe facial trauma,\" the Cleveland Clinic said. She had no nose, right eye or upper jaw before the procedure, and could not smell or eat normally. People would call her names on the street, Siemionow said.The surgery gave the patient a nose with nasal lining, as well as a palate. This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said.Social reincorporation is as important as the face transplant itself, Siemionow said. At this point, the patient doesn't want to face the \"common world,\" but she is facing her family, the surgeon said.The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said. She can also taste a hamburger and pizza, and drink coffee from a cup, the \"things we take for granted every day,\" Siemionow said.The patient also received lower eyelids, upper lip, skin, muscles, bone, hard palate, arteries, veins and nerves.As for the aesthetics of the new face, Siemionow suggested that restoring function was more important. \"At this point, no one is really looking at beautification,\" she said.Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.Only patients who had already exhausted all possible options for conventional repair were considered for the transplant, Siemionow said.Currently, cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because  transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue, Siemionow said. In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said.While burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said.Previously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China. The Chinese recipient, Li Guoxing, died in July of unknown causes, Guo Shuzhong, a doctor involved in the case, confirmed to CNN.One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. The other French patient had been bitten by a dog. The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear.European news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant, which would be the fifth in the world.Researchers are also making headway into treatments for disorders that give rise to facial abnormalities, experts say.

And we should all agree that sometimes, in the name of national security, it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the American people.However, I and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security.In this global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaeda and its allies, too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons: the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority.Torture plays directly into a central tenet of al Qaeda's recruiting pitch: that everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the United States of America.From Morocco to Malaysia, people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and other overseas prisons. The result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide, particularly where we need it most: in the Muslim world.Once permitted, torture and lawlessness are not easily contained. Coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high-level terrorists at Guantanamo to low-level detainees at Abu Ghraib.Years later, images of abuse there remain fixtures across the Arab and Muslim world. And as John McCain has argued, the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well.Torture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it, but from those who seek to conceal it. After years of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing, what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general-designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true: that yes, \"waterboarding is torture.\"As we move forward, President Obama is wise to \"reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals\" -- but the American people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy.Reclaiming Guantanamo and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former Vice President Dick Cheney called \"the dark side\" will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues.However, we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader. Countries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join Albania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies.Still, it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles, many handed over from the previous administration: looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries; and the fact that we already know some released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield.In some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the American people.And even as we embrace long-overdue change, we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited, the sacred responsibility to protect American lives which they strove to honor, and the humbling reality that there are no easy", "truth": ["the rule of"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-1112", "mistake": "The president ordered the eventual closure of Guant Bay prison and CIA \"black site\" prisons, and placed interrogation in all American facilities by all U.S. personnel under the guidelines of the Army Field Manual", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0625}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

You can work out new deals with the unions. But in the end, if people aren't buying cars or they can't get credit, how do you remain viable?Fields: Well, consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now. The good news is, our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received. Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months. We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again.But getting that consumer confidence is really important. And that's why today we're announcing our Ford advantage plan, and it's for any customer who buys a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury product, when they come into the showroom and buy their product, if that customer loses their position, we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they're unemployed, to give them that peace of mind.Post your comments on AMfixChetry: You're also offering some zero percent financing. I'm sure that you're trying to do that as well because of the frozen credit in a lot of instances. I want to get your take on this, though.President Obama announced yesterday he's giving ... Chrysler a month, basically, to submit a reorganization plan that the administration finds acceptable. The Obama administration also of course forced General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner out. Was that the right move, in your opinion?Fields: Well, what we are supportive of is that the president is committed to a vibrant U.S. auto industry. As we mentioned, Ford is in a different position. We're not asking for the emergency taxpayer assistance. But what we are focusing on is taking decisive action to streamline our business, but more importantly win new customers with the great set of products we're going -- we're coming out with over the next couple of months.Chetry: You know, there is some unprecedented government intervention going on right now in the U.S. auto industry at your competitors.

{"input": "Question: who was arrested? </s> Context: NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A top Baha'i official has criticized Iran's claim that the six imprisoned leaders of the religious minority were held for security reasons and not because of their faith.President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government has been accused of trying to eliminate the Baha'i community.Bani Dugal, the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations, called Iran's assertion \"utterly baseless.\"\"The allegations are not new, and the Iranian government knows well that they are untrue,\" Dugal said on Wednesday, quoted in a news release issued by the Baha'i movement.\"The documented plan of the Iranian government has always been to destroy the Baha'i community, and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan.\"Iranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham said the people were detained for \"security issues\" and not their faith, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said.Elham said on Tuesday that the Baha'is were members of a group working together \"against national interest.\"\"The group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners, the Zionists in particular,\" he said.The arrests of the six last week and another Baha'i leader in March sparked sharp condemnation by the Baha'is, the United States, Canada, the European Union and humanitarian groups.The Baha'is say the latest arrests are part of a pattern of religious persecution since 1979, when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created in the predominantly Shiite nation.The Baha'is say they have been killed, jailed and \"otherwise oppressed\" only because of their religion.\"The best proof of this is the fact that, time and again, Baha'is have been offered their freedom if they recant their Baha'i beliefs and convert to Islam, an option few have taken,\" Dugal said.Dugal said Iran's practice of connecting the group to Zionism, the underlying political philosophy of the Jewish state, was a \"distortion\" and an attempt to \"stir animosity\" among the Iranian public.The Baha'i World Center, which the movement refers to as its \"spiritual and administrative heart,\" is in the Acre/Haifa area in northern Israel -- a location that predates the founding of the state of Israel since it was formed during the Ottoman Empire's rule of Palestine.The Baha'is explain that their founder, Baha'u'llah, \"after a series of successive banishments from his native Persia, was exiled, with members of his family and a small band of his followers, to the Turkish penal colony of Acre in 1868.\"Dugal said the Iranian actions were the \"most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the Baha'is as agents of foreign powers, whether of Russia, the United Kingdom, or the United States and now Israel all of which are completely baseless.\"Dugal said the government's philosophies are based largely on the idea that there can be \"no prophet following Mohammed\" and that the faith \"poses a theological challenge to this belief.\"They say Baha'u'llah is regarded by Baha'is as \"the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Mohammed.\"The Baha'is-- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- say they have 5 million members across the globe, and about 300,000 in Iran.", "truth": ["of the religious minority"], "id": "mrqa_newsqa-validation-3737", "mistake": "Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Mohammed", "score": {"EM": 0, "QA-F1": 0.0}, "data_name": "news", "init_status": "error"}

Richard Findley, who died Friday after being struck by a truck. Authorities believe that White was driving the truck, which was thought to be stolen. Police were attempting to flag it down when Findley was struck.\"The killing of the officer is absolutely abhorrent, but also, Mr. White was presumed innocent and deserved his day in court just like any other citizens,\" Johnson said Monday night. \"We live in a constitutional democracy, and no one has the right to be judge and jury.\"The FBI's Baltimore field office said it has opened a civil rights investigation into White's death. The Justice Department said Tuesday that federal prosecutors have been in contact with the state police and FBI as well as county prosecutors and the department's own Civil Rights Division.\"In support of the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office, which intends to retain lead responsibility for the criminal investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office will provide guidance and legal advice to the officials looking into the death and seeking to develop evidence of criminal violations,\" the department said in a written statement.Johnson said Monday that he had requested that the Maryland State Police conduct an independent investigation into White's death.White family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement.

None has been suspended or removed.There were no surveillance cameras in the area of the jail where White was being held. White had not had the opportunity to meet with an attorney, Henry said.A physical conducted when White was processed revealed no health issues, according to Johnson. He was checked regularly in his cell and appeared fine when corrections officers saw him at 10:15 a.m. Sunday.

The deaths occurred between 1986 and 2007.\"Six of the victims were women who were working as prostitutes -- high-risk behavior that makes them vulnerable to crime,\" authorities said.Police believe the killer had sex with the runaway, but she was killed by someone else.The developments have prompted officials to form a local, state and federal task force to investigate the homicides. A state lab is working to determine whether the DNA of at least 23 other slain prostitutes matches that of the killer.\"In the past, we might have linked some of these homicides through their method of operation, but theory has given way to technology,\" said Edward Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief. \"Within the last couple of weeks, we have been able to confirm a link.\"Flynn, who described the killer as an \"unknown suspect who conducts his business in secret,\" said the investigation would require tips from the community.\"This suspect has been able to avoid and evade law enforcement for these last 23 years. He has never been arrested for a felony as he does not appear in any DNA database,\" Flynn said.Police said 42 prostitutes were killed between 1986 and 2007, and that 31 percent of the cases have been solved. There has been a higher clearance rate -- 78 percent -- in other homicides.Of the seven killed, two were in 1986, three in 1995, one in 1997 and one in 2007. The runaway was one of the three killed in 1995.Flynn said there have been \"patterned homicides\" discovered across the country as a result of advanced DNA technology, citing investigations in Los Angeles, California; Mesa, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada. However, he said there is no link with the Milwaukee cases.In discussing advances in DNA technology, Flynn said there were no matches in 1990s, two around 2000 and the seven have been linked in recent weeks.\"We already have determined that five suspects in murders of other prostitutes -- completely unrelated to this investigation -- have been identified because their DNA match open homicide cases.
