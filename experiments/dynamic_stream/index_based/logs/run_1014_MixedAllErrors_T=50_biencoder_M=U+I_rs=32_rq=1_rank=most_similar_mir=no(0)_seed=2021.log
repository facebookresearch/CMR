Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937 , but chose in early 1936 to move re-militarization forward by a year for several reasons , namely : the ratification by the French National Assembly of the Franco - Soviet pact of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against Franco - Soviet `` encirclement '' ; the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937 ; the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge ; economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regime 's popularity ; the Italo - Ethiopian War , which had set Britain against Italy , had effectively broken up the Stresa Front ; and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year . In his biography of Hitler , the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitler 's preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks , and Hitler 's need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 1935 -- 36 . | Question: who defied the treaty of versailles by sending troops into the rhineland ?", ['Adolf Hitler'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-31482'), ("Context: The outer core of the Earth is a fluid layer about 2,400 km ( 1,500 mi ) thick and composed of mostly iron and nickel that lies above Earth 's solid inner core and below its mantle .

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?
