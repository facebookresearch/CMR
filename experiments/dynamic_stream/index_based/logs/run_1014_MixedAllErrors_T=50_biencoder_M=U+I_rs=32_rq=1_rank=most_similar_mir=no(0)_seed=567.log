The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ?

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production .

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great .

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production .

Although Kirei understood the distinction between good and evil , he could only revel in committing sins and accepted that side of himself after attempting to redeem himself . Originally the master of the Assassin of the Fourth Holy Grail War , Kirei secretly murdered Tokiomi to obtain Gilgamesh while becoming an indirect caretaker for Rin . It is also revealed in the prequel Fate / Zero that he is responsible for the fire that killed Shirō 's biological parents , having indirectly wished for it with his dying breath after being shot through the heart by Kiritsugu Emiya . Ranked far lower in the Church hierarchy than Ciel ( from Tsukihime ) , Kirei employs many of the same techniques and weapons she does , as well as a powerful martial art called `` Super Bajiquan '' that allows him to not only match , but also defeat low ranking servants , something the aforementioned Ciel can not do . He can also perform the Baptismal Rite , an immensely powerful holy sacrament used to exorcise demons . Kirei is also skilled at spiritual surgery thanks to his `` Open Wound '' Origin . He is surprisingly powerful as a Magus , having trained under Rin 's father .
