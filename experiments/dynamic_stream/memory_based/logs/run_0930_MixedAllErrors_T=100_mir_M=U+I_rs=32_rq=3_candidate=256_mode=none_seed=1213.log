The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions .

The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structure in India and was originally commissioned by the emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE . Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha . It was crowned by the chatra , a parasol - like structure symbolising high rank , which was intended to honour and shelter the relics . The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka , whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha . Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka 's wedding . In the 1st century BCE , four elaborately carved toranas ( ornamental gateways ) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added .

This , as well , was taken into consideration in the Great chain of being . Advances were made by scholars such as Procopius , Timotheos of Gaza , Demetrios Pepagomenos , and Thomas Aquinas .

Over time, psychoanalysis has been revised and developed in different directions. Some of Freud\'s colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, went on to develop their own ideas independently. Freud insisted on retaining the term psychoanalysis for his school of thought, and Adler and Jung accepted this.  The Neo-Freudians included Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, and Harry Stack Sullivan.  The basic tenets of psychoanalysis include:  # a person\'s development is determined by often forgotten events in early childhood rather than by inherited traits alone  # human attitude, mannerism, experience, and thought is largely influenced by irrational drives that are rooted in the unconscious  # it is necessary to bypass psychological resistance in the form of defense mechanisms when bringing drives into awareness  # conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious, or with repressed material can materialize in the form of mental or emotional disturbances, for example: neurosis, neurotic traits, anxiety, depression etc.  # liberating the elements of the unconscious is achieved through bringing this material into the conscious mind (via e.g. skilled guidance, i.e. therapeutic intervention).   Under the broad umbrella of psychoanalysis there are at least 22 theoretical orientations regarding human mental development. The various approaches in treatment called "psychoanalysis" vary as much as the theories do. The term also refers to a method of analysing child development.  Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the "analysand" (analytic patient) verbally expresses his or her thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst infers the unconscious conflicts causing the patient\'s symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems. The analyst confronts and clarifies the patient\'s pathological defenses, wishes and guilt. Through the analysis of conflicts, including those contributing to resistance and those involving transference onto the analyst of distorted reactions, psychoanalytic treatment can hypothesize how patients unconsciously are their own worst enemies: how unconscious, symbolic reactions that have been stimulated by experience are causing symptoms. Freudian psychoanalysis relies on the concept that it is only after having a cathartic (e.g. healing) experience can a person be "cured" and aided.   Psychoanalysis has received criticism from a wide variety of sources. It is regarded by some critics as a pseudoscience. Nonetheless, it remains a strong influence within the realm of psychiatry, and more so in some quarters than others.   History  1890s  The idea of psychoanalysis () first started to receive serious attention under Sigmund Freud, who formulated his own theory of psychoanalysis in Vienna in the 1890s. Freud was a neurologist trying to find an effective treatment for patients with neurotic or hysterical symptoms. Freud realised that there were mental processes that were not conscious, whilst he was employed as a neurological consultant at the Children\'s Hospital, where he noticed that many aphasic children had no apparent organic cause for their symptoms. He then wrote a monograph about this subject.  In 1885, Freud obtained a grant to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a famed neurologist, at the Salpêtrière in Paris, where Freud followed the clinical presentations of Charcot, particularly in the areas of hysteria, paralyses and the anaesthesias. Charcot had introduced hypnotism as an experimental research tool and developed the photographic representation of clinical symptoms.  Freud\'s first theory to explain hysterical symptoms was presented in Studies on Hysteria (1895), co-authored with his mentor the distinguished physician Josef Breuer, which was generally seen as the birth of psychoanalysis. The work was based on Breuer\'s treatment of Bertha Pappenheim, referred to in case studies by the pseudonym "Anna O.", treatment which Pappenheim herself had dubbed the "talking cure". Breuer wrote that many factors that could result in such symptoms, including various types of emotional trauma, and he also credited work by others such as Pierre Janet; while Freud contended that at the root of hysterical symptoms were repressed memories of distressing occurrences, | Question: September 23, 1939 saw the death of what famed neurologist, best known for founding the field of psychoanalysis?', ['freud', 'freudian', 'sigmund freud', 'freudian theory'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7767'), ("Context: Johnny Whitworth as Markos ( season 1 ) , a mysterious man connected to Jane 's past .

The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.  A Last Hurrah  In 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.  \xa0  Final Stop  After leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.  \xa0  The Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.  \xa0  At the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.

Colorado River Compact was signed by the delegates from the seven Colorado River Basin states : Wyoming , Colorado , Utah and New Mexico were designated Upper Basin states and California , Arizona and Nevada as the Lower Basin states . This compact determined that the water would be shared equally among the upper and lower basin states . Prior to the compact , the name of the river was standardized along its length . Previously the portion of the river upstream from its confluence with the Green River had been known locally as the `` Grand River '' . The change was opposed by many local residents in Utah and Colorado , and the new name was enforced locally by acts of the state legislatures in both states in the early 1920s .

When creating the character , screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite . Wasikowska read Carroll 's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role . She also watched Jan Švankmajer 's Alice . She said , `` When we were kids , my mum would pop it in the VCR player . We would be disturbed , and would n't really understand it , but we could n't look away because it was too intriguing . So I had kept that feeling about Alice , a kind of haunting feeling . '' Although facing pressures to conform to society 's expectations , Alice grows into a stronger - willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path ; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls , describing the character as `` stubborn , brave , ( and ) non-girlie '' . Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six - year - old girl .   Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp , The Mad Hatter . Wasikowska said that the characters , `` both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds , and have a special bond and friendship . '' Burton explained that Depp `` tried to find a grounding to the character ... as opposed to just being mad . '' Burton also said that , `` In a lot of versions it 's a very one - note kind of character and you know ( Depp 's ) goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character .

Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter 's clothes , skin , hair , personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions . In an interview with Depp , the character was paralleled to `` a mood ring , ( as ) his emotions are very close to the surface '' . The Hatter is `` made up of different people and their extreme sides '' , with a gentle voice much like the character 's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent ( which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher 's Rab C. Nesbitt character ) reflecting a darker , more dangerous personality . Illusionary dancer David `` Elsewhere '' Bernal doubled for Depp during the `` Futterwacken '' sequence near the end of the film .   Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims , the Red Queen . She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters : the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts . Her first name is a play on the word irascible because she is easily irritated , obstreperous , impatient , and quick to anger . Bonham Carter 's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen . The character hates animals , and chooses to use them as servants and furniture . It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband , the King .

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, "I shall never take a wife, as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic."

State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can\'t charge tuition fees (they can charge "attendance dues" for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation\'s then-private Catholic school system integrated.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

Its formal dedication as Soldier Field was on Saturday , November 27 , 1926 , during the 29th annual playing of the Army -- Navy Game . Its design is in the Neoclassical style , with Doric columns rising above the East and West entrances . The stadium cost $13 million to construct ( $182 million in 2015 dollars ) , a very large sum for a sporting venue at that time ( in comparison , L.A.

Shooting was entirely on location , and was fraught with difficulties .

The energy for this to happen is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP . Myosin functions as an ATPase utilizing ATP to produce a molecular conformational change of part of the myosin and produces movement . Movement of the filaments over each other happens when the globular heads protruding from myosin filaments attach and interact with actin filaments to form crossbridges . The myosin heads tilt and drag along the actin filament a small distance ( 10 - 12 nm ) . The heads then release the actin filament and then changes angle to relocate to another site on the actin filament a further distance ( 10 - 12 nm ) away . They can then re-bind to the actin molecule and drag it along further . This process is called crossbridge cycling and is the same for all muscles ( see muscle contraction ) . Unlike cardiac and skeletal muscle , smooth muscle does not contain the calcium - binding protein troponin . Contraction is initiated by a calcium - regulated phosphorylation of myosin , rather than a calcium - activated troponin system . | Question: the involuntary movement of smooth muscles is called ?', ['contraction'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-11599')]

Its main purpose in many animals is to supply vital proteins to the cell . It is formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle , and originates from the squamous granulosa cells present at the primordial stage of follicular development . The corona radiata is formed when the granulosa cells enlarge and become cuboidal , which occurs during the transition from the primordial to primary stage . These cuboidal granulosa cells , also known as the granulosa radiata , form more layers throughout the maturation process , and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the Graafian follicle . For fertilization to occur , sperm cells rely on hyaluronidase ( an enzyme found in the acrosome of spermatozoa ) to disperse the corona radiata from the zona pellucida of the secondary ( ovulated ) oocyte , thus permitting entry into the perivitelline space and allowing contact between the sperm cell and the nucleus of the oocyte . | Question: which follicle stage is characterized by the development of a corona radiata ?', ['the transition from the primordial to primary stage'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-24789'), ('Context: The food web in the rhizosphere can be considered as three different channels with two different sources of energy ; the detritus - dependent channels are fungi and bacterial species and the root energy dependent channel consists of nematodes , symbiotic species , and some arthropods . This food web is constantly in flux as the amount of detrius available and the rate of root sloughing changes as roots grow and age . This bacterial channel is considered to be a faster channel because of the ability of species to focus on more accessible resources in the rhizosphere and have faster regeneration times compared with the fungal channel . All three of these channels are also interrelated to the roots that form the base of the rhizosphere ecosystem and the predators , such as the nematodes and protists , that prey upon many of the same species of mircroflora . | Question: what supplies the energy for most of the microorganisms in the rhizosphere ?', ['fungi and bacterial species', 'nematodes , symbiotic species , and some arthropods'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-82497'), ("Context: The active ( trophozoite ) stage exists only in the host and in fresh loose feces ; cysts survive outside the host in water , in soils , and on foods , especially under moist conditions on the latter .

The cysts are readily killed by heat and by freezing temperatures , and survive for only a few months outside of the host . When cysts are swallowed they cause infections by excysting ( releasing the trophozoite stage ) in the digestive tract . The pathogenic nature of E. histolytica was first reported by Lösch in 1875 , but it was not given its Latin name until Fritz Schaudinn described it in 1903 . E. histolytica , as its name suggests ( histo -- lytic = tissue destroying ) , is pathogenic ; infection can be asymptomatic or can lead to amoebic dysentery or amoebic liver abscess . Symptoms can include fulminating dysentery , bloody diarrhea , weight loss , fatigue , abdominal pain , and amoeboma . The amoeba can actually ' bore ' into the intestinal wall , causing lesions and intestinal symptoms , and it may reach the blood stream . From there , it can reach different vital organs of the human body , usually the liver , but sometimes the lungs , brain , spleen , etc .

Nicknamed “The Tin Man”, and described as “as the best all-round jockey that the turf has ever seen”, Archer was the holder of several records which lasted deep into the 20th century. He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, claiming 2,748 victories from 8,064 starts. He won a total of 21 classic races, including Epson Derby five times. He committed suicide at the age of 29 after the loss of his wife during childbirth.  Sir Gordon Richards (5 May 1904 – 10 November 1986) was one of the England’s finest jockeys, often considered the world’s greatest ever jockey. He is still the only jockey to have been knighted. Gordon Richard was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times. He amassed a total of 4,870 winners, and a record 12 consecutive winners ridden. In 1999, the Racing Post (leading racing newspaper in Britain) placed him at number 1 in their list of the top 50 jockeys of 20th century.  Lester Piggott (born 5 November 1935) – is a retired professional jockey and one of the most successful English flat racing jockeys of all time. Nicknamed “The Long Fellow” to his height, Lester Piggott introduced a new style of race-riding that was adopted all over the world and enabled him to become Champion Jockey eleven times. Piggott boasts 4,493 career wins including 30 British classics.  William Lee “Bill” Shoemaker (August 19, 1931 – October 12, 2003) is one of the all-time legends who have graced the sport. Referred to as “The Shoe”, he held the world record of number of professional jockey victories for 29 years. Shoemaker used his small size (1.50 m) to his advantage riding 8,833 winners. A high school dropout, Shoemaker went to ride a total of 40,350 races, and win the United States Champion Jockey by earnings , a record 10 times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1958.  Russell Avery Braze (born 7 August 1958) is the record holder of the most race wins in North American horse racing history . He’s victory counter stopped at the astonishing 12,007 number. Baze won 400 or more races per year for four consecutive years and got rewarded with a special Eclipse Award in 1995. Since then he has on over 400 races a year seven additional times; an achievement that no other jockey has accomplished more than three times. Russell Baze was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. He also received the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 2002.  Julieann Louise “Julie” Krone (born July 24, 1963) is one of the most successful female jockeys in North American horse racing history. Julie became the first female to win a Triple Crown Race when she claimed the Belmont Stakes, riding on Colonial Affair. She sustained number of severe injuries while racing, but always came back stronger. Because of her never give up attitude, Krone was named by USA Today as one of the 10 Toughest Athletes and was honored with the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award by the Women’s Sports Foundation. In 2000 she became the first woman inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy water factor, played almost entirely in silence.  The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast: Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his skiing double in the film is one of the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage while Columbia's Region 1 NTSC disc has the best picture quality, if a little too dark in places, but no extras).  On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 64 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.  19 people found this helpful  3.0 out of 5 starsTrue life story that deserves better  ByThe CinemaScope Caton 22 January 2011  In 1944 Norway which is under Nazi occupation, a group of resistance fighters attempt to sabotage a factory which is producing heavy water which will be used in the development for the first atomic bomb. Based on a true story, Anthony Mann directs this WWII diverting action adventure but with none of the distinction that earmarks his best films. A few years later, this kind of thing would be done better with WHERE EAGLES DARE.

This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos , and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous . Ejiofor noted this , calling Mordo `` a very complex character that , really , I do n't think can be nailed down either way '' . Director Scott Derrickson added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him . Ejiofor described Mordo 's relationship with the Ancient One as `` long and intense '' , while noting a `` growing respect '' between the character and Strange , until `` things get complicated '' . Derrickson felt Mordo was a fundamentalist , saying `` When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code , the process of breaking out of that is a violent one .

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann\'s bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the "atrial conduction system" of the heart.  Structure  The Bachman\'s bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both).  Besides Bachmann\'s bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area.  Function  The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann\'s bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus.  Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann\'s bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.  What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center ...What Is a Bundle Branch Block? - Heart Health Center - EverydayHealth.com  What is a bundle branch block, and how could it affect my future heart health?  — Reba, Indiana  A bundle branch block is a delay or obstruction along the pathway that electrical impulses travel in your heart to make it beat. It is not an obstruction of blood flow in an artery or anywhere else. It indicates an “electrical” problem.  There are several different types of bundle branch blocks, some more serious than others. (They go by names such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree atrioventricular node blocks.) A bundle branch block can occur in people who appear healthy, but it can also be a sign of an underlying heart condition. In most people, bundle branch blocks are benign and nothing to worry about, especially if you have normal exercise tolerance and have had normal stress test results.  In order to really understand how these blocks manifest, you’ll need a short anatomy lesson. I’m afraid I can’t do this any better than the American Heart Association does on its web site, so I am going to pick up some of the AHA’s wording here:  In a normally functioning heart , the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized group of cells in the heart\'s right upper chamber, emits an electrical impulse somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. This impulse then travels throughout the heart on a specified route. As the impulse passes through the heart, the heart muscle contracts (beats). The impulse first travels through the upper chambers (the atria). Between the upper chambers and the lower chambers (the ventricles), the impulse must pass through one small group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Then it goes along a track called the "bundle of His." From there, this bundle divides into a right bundle and a left bundle. These two bundles go to the right and left lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. All of this is much like following the roads on a freeway map.  Normally, the electrical impulse travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed. Thus, both ventricles contract at the same time.  Occasionally, there\'s a block in one of the bundle branches, so | Question: "Where would one find ""Bachmann\'s bundle""?" ?', ['heart', 'cardiac'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3074'), ('Context: Middle - earth : Shadow of Mordor is an open world action - adventure video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.

They simply hypothesized that if the plasma membrane is a bi-layer , then the surface area of the mono - layer of lipids measured would be double the surface area of the plasma membrane . To examine their hypothesis , they performed an experiment in which they extracted lipids from a known number of red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) of different mammalian sources , such as humans , goats , sheep , etc. and then spreading the lipids as a mono - layer in a Langmuir - Blodgett trough . They measured the total surface area of the plasma membrane of red blood cells , and using Langmuir 's method , they measured the area of the mono - layer of lipids . In comparing the two , they calculated an estimated ratio of 2 : 1 . This supported their hypothesis , which led to the conclusion that cell membranes are composed of two apposing molecular layers . The two scientists proposed a structure for this bi-layer , with the polar hydrophilic heads facing outwards towards the aqueous environment and the hydrophobic tails facing inwards away from the aqueous surroundings on both sides of the membrane . Although they arrived at the right conclusions , some of the experimental data were incorrect such as the miscalculation of the area and pressure of the lipid mono - layer and the incompleteness of lipid extraction . They also failed to describe membrane function , and had false assumptions such as that of plasma membranes consisting of mostly lipids . However , on the whole , this envisioning of the lipid bi-layer structure became the basic underlying assumption for each successive refinement in modern understanding of membrane function . | Question: who is the scientist that propounded the bi-lipid molecular layer of cell membrane ?", ['Evert Gorter', 'François Grendel'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-47477'), ("Context: Religion in Australia is diverse .

The executive power of both the vice president and the president is granted under Article Two, Section One of the Constitution. The vice president is indirectly elected, together with the president, to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.  The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession, and would normally ascend to the presidency upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president.   The Office of the Vice President of the United States assists and organizes the vice president\'s official functions.  The vice president is also president of the United States Senate  and in that capacity only votes when it is necessary to break a tie. While Senate customs have created supermajority rules that have diminished this constitutional tie-breaking authority, the vice president still retains the ability to influence legislation; for example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was passed in the Senate by a tie-breaking vice presidential vote.   Additionally, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College.  While the vice president\'s only constitutionally prescribed functions aside from presidential succession relate to their role as President of the Senate, the office is commonly viewed as a component of the executive branch of the federal government. The United States Constitution does not expressly assign the office to any one branch, causing a dispute among scholars whether it belongs to the executive branch, the legislative branch, or both.   The modern view of the vice president as a member of the executive branch is due in part to the assignment of executive duties to the vice president by either the president or Congress, though such activities are only recent historical developments.  Origin  The creation of the office of vice president was a direct consequence of the creation of the Electoral College. Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention gave each state a number of presidential electors equal to that state\'s combined share of House and Senate seats. Yet the delegates were worried that each elector would only favor his own state\'s favorite son candidate, resulting in deadlocked elections that would produce no winners. To counter this potential difficulty, the delegates gave each presidential elector two votes, requiring that at least one of their votes be for a candidate from outside the elector\'s state; they also mandated that the winner of an election must obtain an absolute majority of the total number of electors. The delegates expected that each elector\'s second vote would go to a statesman of national character.  Fearing that electors might throw away their second vote to bolster their favorite son\'s chance of winning, however, the Philadelphia delegates specified that the runner-up would become vice president. Creating this new office imposed a political cost on discarded votes and forced electors to cast their second ballot.  Roles of the vice president  The Constitution limits the formal powers and role of vice president to becoming president,   should the president become unable to serve, prompting the well-known expression "only a heartbeat away from the presidency," and to acting as the presiding officer of the U.S. Senate.  Other statutorily granted roles include membership of both the National Security Council and the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.    President of the United States Senate  As President of the Senate, the vice president has two primary duties: to cast a vote in the event of a Senate deadlock and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney\'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.  Regular duties  As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), the vice president oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote.

Here they are posing for a souvenir photo for General Douglas MacArthur who is scheduled to visit the camp. The scene is from Season 3 "Big Mac" .  M*A*S*H was an ensemble show built around its main cast of up to 8 actors playing the roles of the key staff of the 4077th MASH. Over the years, the series endured many changes in its main cast as some members left and were replaced by others.  Supporting the main cast was a large recurring cast who played various doctors, nurses, supporting staff, patients and civilians. Many of these recurring characters became highly recognizable and an important ingredient in the atmosphere of the MASH as a close knit military community. Also notable was the appearance of many guest stars playing one-off roles. Some of these were already established actors while others were young aspirants at the beginning of their careers. Many young actors who had their first break with M*A*S*H would go on to make significant contributions in film and television elsewhere.  Main characters  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan  The TV series drew most of its main characters from the 1970 film of the same name however new actors were used except for Gary Burghoff who reprised his role as Radar. Klinger, Potter and Winchester were new characters who did not exist in the 1970 film while the roles of Hawkeye and Trapper were reversed--in the film, Trapper was a chest specialist and Chief Surgeon instead of Hawkeye.  Loretta Swit as Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan, and Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce are the only two actors who appear both in the first episode and the last episode. Their two characters, along with Father Mulcahy, all appear in both episodes; however, Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot only, and William Christopher for the rest of the series. Only Alan Alda was present in every episode of the series. The Season 4 episode Hawkeye consists of Hawkeye doing a monologue while in the home of a Korean family. He speaks almost without stopping in order to avoid falling asleep with a concussion. No other main cast character appears.  Whenever a character left the series, the producers experimented by filling the gap with a character who was wholly dissimilar from his predecessor:  Trapper, every bit as much a womanizer and prankster as Hawkeye, was replaced by B.J. Hunnicutt, a devoted family man who tended to take life in stride (though he had a knack for practical jokes).  Henry Blake, a buffoonish but likable and friendly draftee, a competent surgeon but inept as a military commander, was replaced by Colonel Potter, a career soldier who understood the rule book better than anyone else but still earned a great deal of respect from the draftee doctors of the 4077th.  Frank Burns, an almost incompetent doctor and rather unintelligent person in general, but fiercely loyal to the military, was replaced by draftee Major Winchester, who is as skilled a surgeon than Hawkeye, if not better, but frequently outwits the other doctors as well as showing more humanity than they give him credit for having.  Radar began the series as a wise-to-the-ways-of-the-Army-and-the-world teenage boy who was forced to become a man by the war (the way the character was portrayed in the book and feature film), became over time a pure and innocent midwestern youngster with an unflappable ability to keep the M*A*S*H running like a well-oiled machine. This incarnation was replaced (in his job function) with Maxwell Klinger, who was already well known to lie and scheme on a daily basis and who was the epitome of disorder, but learned to handle the day-to-day affairs of the unit tolerably well, though never up to the standard set by Radar.

She was later adopted along with her younger sister Sharon by the Rackham family.  When the Rackham family passed away, they moved in with their Aunt Sylvie until they were old enough to leave home.  At the age of 16, Tracey met Darryl and she became pregnant. After Garth was born, they married a few years afterwards.  Darryl worked on building outdoor conservatories, but unknown to his wife he also robbed banks. Most of it payed off and the family moved into a luxurious house that they named "Dalentrace," where most of the furniture came from more stolen bank deposits.  After being married for 14 years and sending Garth to a private school for higher learning. Tracey found out that Darryl had been arrested with Sharon\'s husband Chris for armed robbery .  At court the two men were sentenced to 12 years in prison, Darryl told Tracey to wait for him.  Tracey was heartbroken and told Sharon that the house would be empty without Darryl and Garth would be crushed. Sharon offered to stay with her to help and support her.

Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC\'s list of Britain\'s Best Sitcoms.  History  The series originated on London\'s comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits".   As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho.  The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer.  Richardson\'s project, The Comic Strip Presents..., aired on Channel 4\'s opening night on 2 November 1982, with The Young Ones following a week later on BBC2.  The series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.  The show was voted number 31 in the BBC\'s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.  Setting  The main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), conceited wannabe anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), oppressed paranoid hippie Neil (Nigel Planer), and the suave, charming Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet\'s landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in "Bambi" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in "Cash".  The show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned.  This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as "variety" shows attracted higher fees than "comedy".  Synopsis  Stories were set in a squalid house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.  When it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Mayall and Edmondson had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot.  Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character | Question: "Who played Vyvyan, a psychotic punk metal medical student with orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars embedded in his forehead, in the UK TV series ""The Young Ones""?" ?', ['adrian edmondson'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3339'), ('Context: The 40 - Year - Old Virgin is a 2005 American sex comedy film directed by Judd Apatow , who co-wrote the screenplay with Steve Carell .

The right to property was a crucial demand in early quests for political freedom and equality , and against feudal control of property . Property can serve as the basis for the entitlements that ensure the realisation of the right to an adequate standard of living and it was only property owners which were initially granted civil and political rights , such as the right to vote . Because not everybody is a property owner , the right to work was enshrined to allow everybody to attain an adequate standard of living . Today discrimination on the basis of property ownership is recognised as a serious threat to the equal enjoyment of human rights by all and non-discrimination clauses in international human rights instruments frequently include property as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited ( see the right to equality before the law ) . | Question: who started the slogan of right to work in france ?", ['Louis Blanc'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-53195'), ("Context: During the following years Northumbria repeatedly changed hands between the English kings and the Norwegian invaders , but was definitively brought under English control by Eadred in 954 , completing the unification of England .

The most common opinion, however, seems to be that it had nine. What made the Hydra so difficult was the fact that, whenever one of its heads was chopped off, two would grow in its place. Hercules managed to get around this rather major obstacle by having his nephew, Iolaus, cauterize each stump with a hot iron as soon as Hercules could chop off a head. The hero then buried the monster\'s immortal head beneath a rock. The task was made somewhat more difficult by Juno, who sent a crab to nip at the feet of Hercules while he battled the Hydra. - Hydra  Various authors have given us different numbers for how many heads Hydra had originally.

The first blood transfusions were also attempted around this time, although these were often unsuccessful and proved fatal in humans.  The first successful blood transfusion recorded was performed by British physician Richard Lower in 1665 when he bled a dog almost to death and then revived the animal by transfusing blood from another dog via a tied artery.  In 1667, Jean-Baptiste Denis who was physician to King Louis XIV, performed the transfusion of blood from an animal to a human. Denis transfused the blood from a sheep to a 15-year old boy and later to a labourer, both of whom survived the transfusions.  Related Stories  Zika virus infection can break down and damage testes of male mice, new research shows  In 1818, British obstetrician James Blundell successfully transfused human blood to a patient who had hemorrhaged during childbirth. In 1901, Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian physician discovered the first human blood groups, which helped transfusion to become a safer practice. By performing experiments in which he mixed blood samples taken from his staff, Landsteiner discovered blood groups A, B and O and established the basic principals of ABO compatibility. In 1907, an American surgeon called Reuben Ottenberg suggested that patient and donor blood should be grouped and cross matched before a blood transfusion procedure.  Between 1914 and 1918, anticoagulants such as sodium citrate were found to prolong the shelf life of blood and refrigeration also proved to be an effective means of preserving blood. In the 1920’s and 30’s, the voluntary donation of blood for storage and use was started. At around the same time, Edwin Cohn developed cold ethanol fractionation, a method of breaking down blood into its component parts to obtain albumin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen, for example.  During the Second World War, blood transfusion was used on a large scale to treat injured soldiers and became well known as a life saving procedure.  “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human ...Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″ | BRANCH  Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″  Abstract  The first experiments in blood transfusion took place in the seventeenth century, using blood drawn from animals. After the death of a French patient and the trial of his physician for manslaughter, transfusion was abandoned for a century and a half. When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth. During the course of the century, transfusion was applied as a remedy to different kinds of sicknesses and injuries, and performed at different times with various fluids. By the 1880s, British doctors had abandoned transfusion with blood in favor of infusion with saline solution; the practice was only again resumed after the recognition of human blood types in the twentieth century. Developments in the practice of transfusion and infusion during the century reflect shifting views of how gender and species identity are embodied, and of relations of affinity and immunity between bodies of different kinds. They also reflect a shift from a vitalist to a mechanist understanding of blood and its function.  Download this page in PDF format  Blood transfusion as a medical practice dates to the seventeenth century; [1] > the first experiments were performed a few decades after William Harvey published his demonstration that blood circulates in the body in De Motu Cordis (1628).\xa0 Harvey’s discovery showed that blood circulated indefinitely, rather than being either consumed within the body or expelled from it. To cure pathologies of the blood was thus no longer exclusively a matter of stimulating or preventing its evacuation; now the goal was to affect blood’s circulation within the body and its interaction with other organs. The earliest blood transfusions involving human subjects were carried out almost simultaneously in France and England in 1667.

(Photo: Microsoft)  After more than 10 years, the era of the Xbox 360 is officially over.  Microsoft announced Wednesday it will stop production of the video game console. The company will continue to sell any remaining Xbox 360 consoles available at retailers until they are gone.  "The Xbox 360 helped redefine an entire generation of gaming at Microsoft," said Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft\'s Xbox division, in a statement. "I am incredibly proud of all of the work and dedication that went into development of the Xbox 360 hardware, services and games portfolio over the last decade."  Spencer says Microsoft will continue to support the device, allowing users to maintain access to the Xbox Live network and call for any technical issues. The company will also continue to sell games while supplies last.  The successor to the original Xbox helped cement Microsoft as a key player in the video game market. As of 2014, sales of the Xbox 360 topped 84 million worldwide.  Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .

NowThe business and culture of our digital lives,  from the L.A. Times  Kinect sex game will not become reality, Microsoft says  December 17, 2010\xa0|\xa0 5:54 pm  Microsoft’s Kinect motion controller has been out for less than two months and already there’s an adult company looking to produce a 3-D sex game for the Xbox 360 console.  But Microsoft, maker of Kinect and Xbox, immediately shot down any speculation that the game will pass the certification process.  Kinect enables video game players to move characters through the use of real-life movements made possible by 3-D object scanning and manipulation. Kinect uses cameras and microphones to track movement and voice commands as a controller.  So the Web was buzzing earlier this week when ThriXXX, an Austria-based game company, posted a YouTube video featuring a graphic demo of a 3-D adult game using the controller for Xbox 360.  But when Microsoft was asked about the prospects of the game actually making it to the video game console, a\xa0spokesperson said in a statement that it wasn\'t going to happen.\xa0  "This isn\'t the first example of a technology being used in ways not intended by its manufacturer, and it won\'t be the last," the statement said.  "Microsoft did not authorize or license its technology for this use," it said. "Xbox is a family friendly games and entertainment console and does not allow Adults Only (AO) content to be certified for use on its platform, and would not condone this type of game for Kinect."

This cigar is considered the cradle of the Hoyo de Monterrey line of cigars. It is nice looking with a beautiful dark brown wrapper and burns harmoniously and uniformly. Considering flavor, the wrapper combines earthy and spicy aromas with herbaceous pre-draw. When light it presents the palate with woody and earthy flavors. The second third of the smoke reveals the taste of cocoa and spice interspersed with subtle chili-like flavors. The after-taste following the last third is unusually sweet combining it with mushroom flavors. This is one of the tastiest cigars you can ever smoke.  History  Hoyo de Monterrey brand has a long history on the international market of Cuban cigars. Everything is dating since back in 1865 when Don Jose Gener y Batet established this marque of Cuban cigars after he purchased one of the most qualitative plantations of tobacco from the famous region of Cuba, Vuelta Abajo. In time, the brand imposed itself on the market, but with a higher success on the British one. There are only a few brands of Cuban cigars that can be proud of their success. The huge success of this brand was not solely because of the high quality tobacco from Vuelta Abajo, but also due to the wide variety of flavours which can be found in each line of this brand. One of the most appreciated lines created by this brand is considered to be Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure Especial. This line earned a fantastic popularity among all levels of Cuban cigars smokers.  Searching for the finest line of cigars created under the name of Hoyo de Monterrey can be a difficult task as they all are excellent. However, the line Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure Especial is distinguishing itself by others through the immense quantity of flavours, the imposing size of the cigar and with their spectacular appearance.

Also, on the cigar you will not notice prominent veins, but only a few of them that are very thin. The construction of the cigar is perfect. The cigar is solid built, with no soft spots that can make you have a difficult time while smoking it.

09/30/2021 16:06:21 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: TurbineA turbine (from the Latin turbo, a vortex, related to the Greek , tyrbē, meaning "turbulence"),   is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: The 76,192 - square - kilometre ( 29,418 sq mi ) island is divided between two separate , sovereign nations : the Spanish - speaking Dominican Republic ( 48,445 km , 18,705 sq mi ) to the east , and French Creole - speaking Haiti ( 27,750 km , 10,710 sq mi ) to the west .

Morgan Whitaker, AOL.com  Sep 28th 2015 7:00AM  NASA has set the Internet abuzz after announcing that it is unveiling a "major science finding from the agency\'s ongoing exploration of Mars."  The space agency is scheduled to discuss the details of the discovery on Monday at 11:30 a.m. EDT -- but speculation is already running rampant ahead of the big reveal.  READ MORE: Stargazers witness rare event in supermoon eclipse  Many space experts believe that the finding could be related to the discovery of flowing water on the planet\'s surface after noticing that some of the participants in the news conference are authors on a paper on the same topic scheduled to be delivered this week.  Researchers already know that frozen water exists on Mars in the form of ice caps, but the discovery of liquid flowing water would have much more significant meaning.

Pamuk, a fellow at Columbia University, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was overjoyed by the award and accepted it not just as "a personal honor, but as an honor bestowed upon the Turkish literature and culture I represent."  The author did have one complaint: The Swedish Academy announced the prize at 7 a.m., EDT.  "They called and woke me up, so I was a bit sleepy," said the 54-year-old Pamuk, adding that he had no immediate plans to celebrate, but looked forward to being with friends back in Turkey.  The selection of Pamuk, whose recent trial for "insulting Turkishness" made headlines worldwide, continues a trend among Nobel judges of picking writers in conflict with their own governments. British playwright Harold Pinter, a blunt opponent of his country\'s involvement in the Iraq war, won last year. Elfriede Jelinek, a longtime critic of Austria\'s conservative politicians and social class, was the 2004 winner.  Pamuk, whose novels include "Snow" and "My Name Is Red," was charged last year for telling a Swiss newspaper in February 2005 that Turkey was unwilling to deal with two of the most painful episodes in recent Turkish history: the massacre of Armenians during World War I, which Turkey insists was not a planned genocide, and recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey\'s overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast.  "Thirty-thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands, and nobody but me dares to talk about it," he said in the interview.  The controversy came at a particularly sensitive time for the overwhelmingly Muslim country. Turkey had recently begun membership talks with the European Union, which harshly criticized the trial. The charges against Pamuk were dropped in January.  "I think that Orhan Pamuk was a splendid choice for the Nobel Prize, not only for the evident literary merit of his work, but because of his courageous defiance of political pieties in Turkey," historian Ron Chernow, president of the PEN American Center, the U.S. chapter of the international writers-human rights organization, said in an e-mail to the AP.  Virtually the only Turkish author widely known to U.S. readers, Pamuk embodies the push and pull between East and West, between writers and the state, between what we know and what we want to know. Pamuk has become a celebrated and resented reminder of his country\'s darkest past, like such Nobel laureates as Germany\'s Guenter Grass and Mississippi native William Faulkner, whose tormented narratives of the American South became models for Pamuk.  "I have so much respect for Faulkner," Pamuk told the AP on Thursday. "What Faulkner did was to combine complicated history with modernist literature, experimental literature, with an art that is authentic and new and daring. I have also tried to do that."  "Snow," a deeply sad and dreamlike novel published in the United States in 2004, is among the most political of Pamuk\'s works. It tells of the despair young women in a small Turkish town feel when the state decrees that they can\'t wear their Islamic headscarves at their university, a divisive issue for many in Turkey, where most women cover their hair in the Muslim tradition.  Many of the educated, liberal Turkish women who read "Snow," Pamuk said in a 2004 interview with the AP, "felt I should not pay so much understanding to the humiliation of a woman who is not allowed to wear a head scarf."  He has spoken up for others in peril.

Quantity:  Quantity: 1 - Scale of Hardness Rock Set with Diamond This is the traditional Mohs Scale with a small raw diamond included. There are ten numbercodedspecimens measuringapproximately 1 x 1 1/2 inches(except the diamond, dont you wish!). The determination of the hardness of a mineral can be an important step toward its identification. Hardness is the resistance which the smooth surfof a mineral offers to being scratched. A diamond is the hardest of all substances and can only be scratched by another diamond. Over a century ago, Friedrich Mohs by experimentation made up a scale of hardness which is referred to as Mohs scale. It does not imply an exact hardness, but is set up so that any mineral can scratch all those beneath it in the scale, or can be scratched by those above it in the scale. Since a diamond is the hardest it is given the number 10; talc is the softest so it is given number 1. Quartz is often used as a division in the scale and all those above 7 are called hard minerals. Here are the samples included in the set and their number on the scale of hardness: 1 Talc 6 Feldspar 2 Gypsum 7 Quartz 3 Calcite 8 Beryl 4 Fluorite 9 Corundum 5 Apatite 10 Diamond Some very familiar objects can be used in conjunction with this scale. A fingernail has the hardness of 2. 5, a copper coin between 3 and 4, a nail about 5, common window glass 5. 5, a steel file or porcelain tile 6. 5. Other minerals are sometimes substituted in the scale such as topaz for beryl since they both have a hardness of 8. Scale of hardness with diamond is recommended for grades 6 to 12. Age: 9 years Features:  Ages 11-18. Grades 6-12. Ten specimens, approximately 1 x 1 1/2 (except diamond), number-coded. Traditional Mohs Scale with a small diamond included.

The hardness of a mineral largely determines its durability and is related also to the strength and toughness of solid substances. It is important not to confuse hardness of a material with strength. Many hard materials (such as diamonds) are brittle and will break easily if they are struck. However, in common usage the term 'hardness' is often extended to include strength and toughness.  Strength of Materials  A full discussion of the strength of materials is beyond the scope of this Entry. Suffice it to say that there are different types of strength:  Types of strength  Bending  When it is bent.  Hence, in simple terms, the strength of a material is a measure of its resistance to various forms of deformation.  Hardness  The relative hardness of minerals is determined according to Mohs Scale, named after the German mineralogist, Friedrich Mohs , who devised it in 1812. In the original Mohs Scale, ten minerals were arranged in order of increasing hardness and were assigned the numbers one to ten.

In short , many in those colonies believed that , as they were not directly represented in the distant British Parliament , any laws it passed affecting the colonists ( such as the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act ) were illegal under the Bill of Rights 1689 , and were a denial of their rights as Englishmen . | Question: who asked for representation in parliament in return for taxes ?", ['American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-29726'), ("Context: A long - distance relationship ( LDR ) ( or long - distance romantic relationship ( LDRR ) is an intimate relationship between partners who are geographically isolated from one another . Partners in LDRs face geographic separation and lack of face - to - face contact . LDRs are particularly prevalent among college students - constituting 25 % to 50 % of all relationships .

The latter 's title track , `` Second Time Around '' , was sung by Frederick in a duet with Teresa James . It illustrated the story of the show 's newly married couple , Frank Lambert ( Patrick Duffy ) and Carol Foster ( Suzanne Somers ) , as they had visions of mixing their households of kids together . Step By Step was another TGIF hit , running six seasons on ABC and its seventh and final on CBS . From 1992 to 1994 , Frederick and Salvay 's newest project with Miller / Boyett was at first titled A New Day in its earliest development . Following a revamp in its creation ( by Bickley / Warren ) , it premiered on TGIF in March 1993 as Getting By . The series had two different theme songs during each of its two seasons , the second of which aired on NBC . The first theme that Frederick and Salvay wrote was sentimental in nature with woodwind instrumentation , and sung by Mark Lennon . The second theme had the funk / hip - hop sound that had started to be heard on sister shows such as Family Matters , and had a different male vocalist . In 1994 , the two worked on Miller / Boyett 's single - season comedy On Our Own . It starred Ralph Louis Harris and the six Smollett siblings as a family learning to fend for themselves after the death of their parents . The series ' theme , one in a long line of feel - good , inspirational tunes from Frederick and Salvay , was performed by Joe Turano . | Question: who sang the theme song to step by step ?", ['Frederick in a duet with Teresa James'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-6167')]

They think it\'s all over - it is now!"  Photo: PA  Kenneth Wolstenholme | Obituaries | News | The IndependentKenneth Wolstenholme | The Independent  Kenneth Wolstenholme  Wednesday 27 March 2002 00:00 BST  Click to follow  The Independent Online  Kenneth Wolstenholme, sports commentator: born Worsley, Lancashire 17 July 1920; DFC 1944, bar 1945; married (one daughter); died Torquay, Devon 25 March 2002.  There is a deep irony in the long-running success of the BBC television show They Think It\'s All Over. The broadcaster who had coined the phrase at the 1966 World Cup Final, Kenneth Wolstenholme, protested angrily at the use of the title for a programme he thought was tacky, and threatened legal action.  His complaints were brushed aside, just as he himself had been brushed aside in 1970 when the BBC replaced Wolstenholme, then virtually the nation\'s only football commentator, with David Coleman. Wolstenholme deserved better from the corporation he had served, in radio and television, since soon after the Second World War. Had he gone quietly, he might have been favoured with a job elsewhere in the BBC, but he continued to rail against what he thought of as declining standards and dumbing down until his death.  He was born in Worsley, near Bolton, in 1920 and stayed loyal to the Wanderers. He worked in local newspapers until he joined the RAF, anticipating call-up by volunteering for pilot training in 1938. He flew Blenheims and Mosquitos during the war, taking part in more than 100 missions, and was awarded a DFC and bar. He entered broadcasting in Manchester and commentated on his first televised match in 1948, although he was far better known as a radio reporter in the 1950s, a period when football relied almost entirely on newspapers and the BBC for exposure.  When Henry Rose, the Daily Express\'s northern football writer, arrived in the press box at Anfield on a Saturday afternoon the Liverpool crowd would rise and applaud. Wolstenholme enjoyed a similar status among listeners as he pronounced upon the latest choice of an England team, made in those days by three or four club directors in the guise of FA selectors.  Wolstenholme became internationally famous in 1964 when the BBC launched Match of the Day, the  Saturday-night showing first of one match and then of a selection of matches that became a national institution. Wolstenholme was its first presenter and was successful enough to be confirmed as the BBC\'s presence at all the major football events, in which role he went on to cover 23 FA Cup Finals, 16 European Cup Finals and five World Cup Finals. It was at Wembley, in 1966, that he told a cheering nation, as Geoff Hurst ran in on Germany\'s goal, "Some people are on the pitch. They think it\'s all over . . . [The ball flew into the net.] It is now."  Four years later he was replaced for the 1970 World Cup Final by David Coleman. He thought the dismissal sudden enough to be termed brutal: "It was clear they didn\'t want me any more and I was a bit miffed about that." He was too famous not to find other employment, and his very familiar voice could later be heard on Channel 4, where he presented Italian football.  He even made a return to radio football in 1991 but his career with Metro FM, a North-east station, lasted for just one broadcast, Watford v Sunderland. The producer commented: "Our style is fast, pacy and upbeat. Ken had plenty to say but he was too laid-back."

Now, the 1984 romantic comedy is getting a remake – this time with a twist.  Producer Brain Grazer admitted during an interview with CNBC that a remake of “Splash”; was in the works. While Grazer kept mostly mum on the details, he revealed that this version of the story would be told from the mermaid’s perspective.  RELATED: John Stamos Singing “Under The Sea’ From “The Little Mermaid’ Is The Best Way To Start Your Weekend  The original film saw an unlucky-in-love Tom Hanks fall in love with a beautiful mermaid, played by Daryl Hannah, after she rescues him from drowning.

Simply titled “Wet”;, there’s no word on if the film’s original stars will appear in the sequel, but Grazer did share at least one big name could be attached to the project.  “There’s a movie star involved, or going to be involved,”; Grazer said during the interview. “I haven’t announced it.”;  RELATED: Casting Call: Stars Nab A New Role Gallery  “Wet”;”s mermaid star would certainly be at home on land or sea.

Movie Review - - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE ...Movie Review -    - SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE - NYTimes.com  SCREEN: 'SPLASH,' A MERMAID'S LOVE  By JANET MASLIN  Published: March     9, 1984  THOUGH Ron Howard's comedies don't adhere to any familiar formulas - Mr. Howard's funny ''Night Shift'' was about a prostitution ring operating out of a morgue, and his even more disarming new ''Splash'' is about a mermaid in Manhattan - they have a comfortably old-fashioned flavor. ''Splash'' may feature a heroine with fins, but it's mostly a standard love story, albeit one with some delightful new twists. The boy (Tom Hanks) is a lonely bachelor with a single overriding wish: ''to meet a woman, fall in love, get married, have a kid and see him play a tooth in the school play.'' And the girl (Daryl Hannah) at first knows only one word of English: ''Bloomingdale's.''  ''Splash,'' which opens today at the National and other theaters, accomplishes the improbable with some enchanting underwater sequences, scenes that make credible the thought that Daryl Hannah might really be a mermaid. Following a brief prologue in which she meets Allen Bauer, played by Mr. Hanks when both are children, the mermaid reappears to save his life when he falls overboard near Cape Cod. There are hints that Allen may be susceptible to aquatic creatures in the decors of both his office and his apartment, since there are large fish tanks in both places (only rarely does Mr. Howard use such unnecessarily broad strokes). But nothing in his past hints at how hard Allen will fall for the beautiful, innocent mermaid once she sprouts a pair of tawny legs and follows him home.

The new park was originally called New Sportsman 's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison Field . Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman 's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals , the St. Louis Browns . In 1953 , the Anheuser - Busch Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman 's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium , later becoming Busch I . The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season . The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium , or Busch II , in downtown St. Louis , opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005 .

The most common opinion, however, seems to be that it had nine. What made the Hydra so difficult was the fact that, whenever one of its heads was chopped off, two would grow in its place. Hercules managed to get around this rather major obstacle by having his nephew, Iolaus, cauterize each stump with a hot iron as soon as Hercules could chop off a head. The hero then buried the monster\'s immortal head beneath a rock. The task was made somewhat more difficult by Juno, who sent a crab to nip at the feet of Hercules while he battled the Hydra. - Hydra  Various authors have given us different numbers for how many heads Hydra had originally.

Published on Nov 8, 2014  This video is about Mitochondrial Eve  The idea that a African Woman, “Mitochondrial Eve", is the woman from whom all people on earth inherit their DNA  Is proven to be a scientific  fact.  In the field of human genetics, the name Mitochondrial Eve refers to the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living anatomically modern humans,  She is from Africa, & is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago.  This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend.  The dating for "Eve" was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis and a boost to the theory of the origin and dispersion of modern humans from Africa.  The biblical connotation was very clear from the start.  1 January 1987 in Nature, in which their findings clearly showed that all current human mtDNA originated from a single population from Africa.  mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or matrilineally.  The Human MRCA studies, confirm that All humans alive today share a surprisingly recent common African ancestor, This is true, even for people born on different continents.  Category  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through ...Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  Adam and Eve existed say Renowned genetics expert through DNA research  by John Taylor  Background:  In human genetics, Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans. This is the most recent woman from whom all living humans today descend, in an unbroken line, on their mother’s side, and through the mothers of those mothers, and so on, back until all lines converge on one woman, who is estimated to have lived approximately 100,000–200,000 years ago. Because all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) generally (but see paternal mtDNA transmission) is passed from mother to offspring without recombination, all mtDNA in every living person is directly descended from hers by definition, differing only by the mutations that over generations have occurred in the germ cell mtDNA since the conception of the original “Mitochondrial Eve”.  Mitochondrial Eve is named after mitochondria and the biblical Eve. Unlike her biblical namesake, she was not the only living human female of her time. However, her female contemporaries, excluding her mother, failed to produce a direct unbroken female line to any living person in the present day.  Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived between 99,000 and 200,000 years ago, most likely in East Africa, when Homo sapiens sapiens (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species.  Origin of the name:  Cann, Stoneking and Wilson did not use the term “Mitochondrial Eve” or even the name “Eve” in their original paper; it appears to be a catchy term popularised by the media.

By 1978 , the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations , including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas . In 1985 , the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel ( 47 % ) were significantly higher than that of US civilians ( 30 % ) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness . The report also cited an estimated tobacco - related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million , and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military , including the elimination of tobacco products from stores , raising tobacco prices to civilian levels , and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking . In 1986 , the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced , `` an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services . '' It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption . The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training , increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas , and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty . The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians , and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990 . In 1992 , the DeCA Directive 40 - 13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel , and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back . In 1993 , the USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN - 71 ) became the first smoke - free Navy ship . By 1994 , the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces , designated outdoor smoking areas , and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit . Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government - owned , rented , or leased interior spaces , but the Department of Defense approved a three - year phase - in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7 , 2002 . Despite these attempts , by 1988 , the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians . And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9 % from 1980 to 1998 , it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing . | Question: when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations ?", ['1975'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-35789'), ("Context: On April 21 , 2016 , HBO officially ordered the seventh season of Game of Thrones , just three days prior to the premiere of the show 's sixth season .

We 're heading into the final lap . '' Director Jack Bender , who worked on the show 's sixth season , said that the seventh season would consist of seven episodes .

She performed professionally in London before joining Les Ballets Russes in 1923.  After she left Les Ballets Russes in 1925, de Valois established a private dance studio in London and started a ballet company. The Vic-Wells Ballet changed names numerous times before becoming the Royal Ballet, one of the world\'s leading classical ballet companies. De Valois started a second ballet company in 1946 that is now located in Birmingham and called the Birmingham Royal Ballet.  In addition to her numerous administrative and teaching duties, de Valois choreographed several works, including The Rake\'s Progress (1935), The Prospect Before Us (1940) and a version of Don Quixote (1950). Her talent for launching national dance companies extended beyond Britain. She was instrumental in recommending Celia Franca for the position of founding artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada . In 1956, de Valois became the founding director of the Turkish State Ballet.  Although she officially retired from her position as artistic director of the Royal Ballet in 1963, de Valois remained on faculty at the Royal Ballet School for a number of years.  De Valois was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1951.  Websites:  Royal Ballet  Learn more:  De Valois, Ninette. Come Dance with Me. [1957] Dublin: Lilliput, 1992. ---. Invitation to the Dance.

"It must be Madam," said those of us who could not see her, and everyone spontaneously rose to applaud the fragile, white-haired figure who had been wheeled to her place at the side of the stalls circle.  Madam it was. Dame Ninette de Valois, who has died aged 102, had made it, as she had made it almost every year, to see the student dancers who would carry forward the work she had started so many years ago - the tiny enterprise that was to grow into the whole edifice of the Royal Ballet and its school.  Earlier that year, on February 20, she had made it to Covent Garden for the 50th anniversary of the reopening of the Royal Opera House in 1946 with her company\'s production of The Sleeping Beauty. And she had come on stage for a standing ovation, led by the Queen from the royal box.  She was also at Sadler\'s Wells that year for the final gala there, before the demolition of the theatre where her company had started. Far from being sentimental or nostalgic, Dame Ninette, although she never ceased to recognise the vital part which that theatre, thanks to Lilian Baylis, had played in the foundation of British ballet, knew it was time for rebuilding and lent her blessing to the enterprise.

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn al-Athir, writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event. Various historical secondary sources - Morgan, Chambers, Grousset - state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory. The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals.

William Hartnell (who in time became the first\xa0 Doctor Who ) was the appropriately named Sergeant-Major Bullimore, with Bill Fraser as the odious beady-eyed Sergeant Claude Snudge, who together had responsibility for the men in Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.  Modelled on the 1956 film\xa0 Private\'s Progress , the concept was simple: a group of men serving out time as conscripts in the army are determined to dodge duty and derive maximum fun out of a situation they\'d rather not be in.  The fact that\xa0 National Service \xa0was still compulsory in Britain when the series began, and also that the Second World War had only been over for 12 years, meant that audiences could readily identify with the situation, and sympathise with the plight of the conscript.  Michael Medwin (later replaced by Harry Fowler) led as motley a crew of conscripts as you\'re ever likely to meet, played by Bernard Bresslaw, Norman Rossington, Charles Hawtrey (whose character was heavily into knitting) and Alfie Bass, who portrayed Private "Excused Boots" Bisley.  Bresslaw displayed a minus IQ in the series and had a catchphrase of "I only arsked" which became the title of a 1958 film spin-off.  Mostly broadcast live to air, the show spawned a Top 5 pop hit in 1958 with its theme tune. But not everyone saw the funny side of\xa0The Army Game, and a real serving officer believed it to be a corrupting influence and decreed that the men in his command should not watch it.\xa0He relented after the cast heard of his edict and "invaded" his headquarters.  The cast of\xa0The Army Game\xa0changed a great deal over the years (remarkably, for a short while, three of the characters were played by different actors before their principals returned to the roles), with most of the original members leaving after the second series.  That slow drain of thespian talent - Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw, William Hartnell and Michael Medwin were among the first to go - proved the show\'s undoing.  New arrivals who felt honour-bound to devise skiving stratagems included the cowardly Private Bone, Corporal \'Flogger\' Hoskins (another Cockney sharpster, to replace the departed Springer) and Private \'Chubby\' Catchpole, played by Dick Emery whose stock line "Hello, honky tonks" he took into his later solo show .  The episodes of\xa0The Army Game\xa0that have survived the passing years do not seem anywhere near as funny now as they once were, probably because the era of National Service \xa0has since long passed into the memory.  One further peacetime army sitcom was tried in the 1970s ( Get Some In! ) but, otherwise, subsequent service productions have harked back further, to the war years, the most notable example being the BBC\'s\xa0 Dad\'s Army \xa0(Frank Williams - the vicar in\xa0Dad\'s Army\xa0- was the dithering Captain Pocket in\xa0The Army Game.)  In 1960, Alfie Bass and Bill Fraser marched their beloved characters into civvy street for\xa0 Bootsie and Snudge .

The British were victorious in this war , and as a result desired access to the teak , oil and rubies of northern Myanmar . This prompted the Third Anglo - Burmese War in 1885 . The British government justified their actions by claiming that the last independent king of Myanmar , Thibaw Min , was a tyrant and that he was conspiring to give France more influence in the country .

When Guiteau, a lawyer with a history of mental illness, shot Garfield in the back on July 2, 1881, he thought God had told him to shoot the president. He also thought he had killed the president, but it wasn\'t the bullet that did the job.  page 1 of 2  James Garfield Assassination - 20th American PresidentJames Garfield Assassination - 20th American President  James Garfield Assassination  James Garfield Assassination  The assassination of James Abram Garfield  Charles Guiteau borrowed $15  dollars and bought a revolver at a sporting goods store for $10. The  revolver was an ivory handled .44 caliber british bulldog. He Checked  into the Riggs House hotel room 222 on the night before he was to  execute his plan.  Guiteau  arrived at the rail station early on July 2, and lay in wait for the  President to arrive, lurking about the train station to find the proper  attack point. Garfield was en route while Guiteau waited feverishly.  President James Garfield planned to leave Washington D.C. around 9:30 in the morning on July 2,  1881 from the Baltimore & Potomac train station. He was going to meet  up with First Lady Lucretia Garfield in Massachusetts for a long awaited and deserved vacation.  Garfield arrived at the rail station with Secretary of State James G. Blaine. In  another carriage just behind, followed Garfield\'s two oldest sons, while Lucretia in poor health and still recovering, was resting in a New  Jersey resort and preparing for travel.  Garfield and Secretary Blaine  arrived at the train station and were making their way through the  crowds as Guiteau approached them from behind. Guiteau raised his  gun, aimed, fired and the first shot grazed and stunned the President. He then fired  a second shot that struck the President forcefully and lodged deep into his  back. Garfield slumped to the tile floor, looking on as Guiteau was pounced upon, quickly subdued and arrested. Guiteau requested to be taken to jail at once and he was obliged.  Guiteau  Left a letter to be found the morning of the shooting addressed to  General William Tecumseh Sherman: July 2, 1881. It Read...  "I  have just shot the President. I shot him several times, as I wished him  to go as easily as possible...I am going to the jail. Please order out  your troops and take possession of the jail at once."  Dr.  Smith Townsend was the first doctor to reach Garfield and attempt  treatment of his gunshot wounds. Unimaginable today in the 21st century, doctors probed the  presidents wound in search of the bullet lodged deep inside without  sterilization, unwashed hands and non sterile instruments. First; Dr.  Willard Bliss, then Surgeon General of the Army, and Surgeon General of  the  Navy.  Garfield was first brought to a room upstairs above the depot on a mattress and later transported to the White House  On  July 26th a young Alexander Graham Bell brought a sort of makeshift apparatus to the  White House he had worked on for days. Combining two different inventions to  create a metal detection device. He attempted to locate the bullet with  the new device, which he referred to as an induction balance. The  attempt was to no avail. (The first X-ray machine was not invented until November 8,  1895 by Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen).  The bullet was never found by Bells  invention nor during any of the intrusive probing by doctors unwashed  hands. It wouldn\'t be until Garfield\'s death and an autopsy was  performed that the discovery was made. The bullets path deviated to the  left and rested just behind the pancreas. Sadly the bullet was not in a  life threatening position. | Question: Which American president was assassinated by Charles Guiteau in 1881?', ['president garfield'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5704'), ('Context: Most goals in a season : Ian Rush , 47 ( during the 1983 -- 84 season ) . | Question: most goals scored in a season by a liverpool player ?', ['47'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-87326'), ("Context: Misconduct will result in the player either receiving a caution ( indicated by a yellow card ) or being dismissed ( `` sent off '' ) from the field ( indicated by a red card ) .

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and digital cameras.  Camera obscura  Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura, a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese  and ancient Greeks,   which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface.  An Arab physicist, Ibn al-Haytham, published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD. He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter. Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images. Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura.   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse, publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year.   In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing.   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce\'s time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.  Early fixed images  The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce,  using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.  The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.  Daguerreotypes and calotypes  After Niépce\'s death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.  Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.  Dry plates  Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855, thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called "instantaneous" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. | Question: Who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', ['fox talbot', 'henry fox talbot'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6913'), ('Context: Sherrod Brown ( D )   Stephen Faris ( write - in )   Philena Irene Farley ( G , write - in )   Bruce Jaynes ( L )   Jim Renacci ( R ) | Question: who is running for us senate from ohio ?', ['Jim Renacci ( R )', 'Stephen Faris ( write - in )', 'Philena Irene Farley ( G , write - in )', 'Sherrod Brown ( D )', 'Bruce Jaynes ( L )'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-32005'), ('Context: The United States are the most successful nation in the history of the competition , with 32 victories .

Anne and her elder sister Mary received a Protestant upbringing although their father James converted to Catholicism and remarried.  In 1683 Anne married Prince George of Denmark (1653�1708).  She had between 16 and 18 pregnancies but only one child survived - William, Duke of Gloucester who died aged 11 of smallpox in 1700.  Her sister Mary married William of Orange but Anne was forbidden by her father to visit her in the Netherlands. When William landed in England in 1688 to take the throne, Anne on the influence of her close friend Sarah Churchill (1650�1744) the wife of John Churchill (1650�1722), supported her sister and brother-in-law against her father James. Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough by William when he was crowned King William III and her sister Queen Mary II. Anne detested her brother-in-law, and the Churchills' influence led her briefly during William�s reign to engage in Jacobite intrigues.  Mary died in 1694 and on William�s death in 1702 Anne succeeded to the throne as Queen Anne. When she was crowned in April 1702 Anne was 37 years old and after her many pregnancies had poor health and no longer her youthful figure.  She was shy and stubborn and very different from her outgoing sister Mary. Anne and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, remained close friends � Anne addressed Sarah as �Mrs Freeman� and she called Anne �Mrs Morley�.  Sarah�s husband the Duke of Marlborough commanded the English Army in the War of Spanish Succession, and won a series of victories over the French at Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708) and Malplaquet (1709). The influence of the Churchill�s however began to decline and after a violent quarrel in 1710, Sarah Churchill was dismissed from court. Abigail Masham succeeded the duchess as Anne's favourite, using her influence to further the Tories.  Towards the end of her life, Anne suffered from gout and she could hardly walk. On her death in 1714 her body had swollen so large that she was buried in an almost square coffin. On the question of succession, Anne's family loyalty had convinced her that this should fall to her father's son by his second wife (Mary of Modena), James Edward Stuart, known as the Old Pretender. However, the Act of Settlement in 1701 ensured Protestant succession to the throne, and Anne was succeeded by George I, great-grandson of James I.  Queen Anne's Signature  Quotes:  �She meant well and was not a fool; but nobody can maintain that she was wise, nor entertaining in conversation� � Sarah Churchill (about Queen Anne)  �Queen Anne was the quintessence of ordinariness; she also had more than her fair share of small-mindedness, vulgarity and downright meanness� � Historian J.P. Kenyon  �Cricket is not illegal, for it is a manly game� - Queen Anne.  �Brandy Nan� � nickname for Queen Anne (who was reputedly fond of drink).

The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002, before being revived by the same channel in 2006 under the title of All Star Family Fortunes . The game involves two families providing answers to \'everyday questions\' that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show (e.g. \'Name something usually done in the dark\') to win cash prizes (and sometimes mystery prizes for giving a correct answer). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, originally known as "Mr. Babbage", which famously sounds a wrong answer "Eh-uhh" sound effect and its accompanying X to signal the strike, as well as a "ding" for a right answer).  Contents  11 External links  Hosts and presentation[ edit ]  Family Fortunes was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980–83) then by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983–85). After being rested for the whole of 1986, the show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter, and had a consistently successful run for the next 15 years. It was then moved out of peak time and became a daily daytime show, hosted by Andy Collins , but it only had a short run in this format before being axed.  In 2006, the series was revived with Vernon Kay as host, and was renamed All Star Family Fortunes , as each team consisted of a celebrity and four family members. The show was also transmitted back to peak time. Prize money goes to a charity of the celebrity\'s choice, and contestants being either celebrity families, or a group of actors famous for playing a fictional family. Several Christmas specials of All Star Family Fortunes have aired as well.  The most iconic aspects of the show are the large computer screen, named "Mr Babbage" by original host Bob Monkhouse and the famous computerised "Eh-uhh" sound used when wrong answers are given. Both were originally designed to appear high-tech but have since become fondly regarded for being quite the opposite (as compared to the original US Feud, which has used a video board since its 1999 revival). The computer screen name "Mr Babbage" was in recognition to the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer, Charles Babbage .  Format[ edit ]  Two family teams, each with five members, are asked to guess the results of surveys, in which 100 people would be asked open ended questions (e.g. "we asked 100 people to name something associated with the country Wales" or "we asked 100 people to name a breed of dog"). Although rarely acknowledged in the show, the 100 people surveyed are invariably audience members who have volunteered before the show.  Each round begins with a member of each family (in rotation, meaning all players do this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question is read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the most popular answer, the other nominee is asked. The family with the more popular answer then chooses whether to "play" the question, or "pass" control to the other family.  The host then passes down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each. After each answer, the board reveals whether this answer featured. If not, the family is assessed a strike, and the family loses control of the board after accumulating three strikes (also referred as striking out) in the round. If a family manages to come up with all the survey answers (most commonly six in the early part of the show, reduced in number after the commercial break) before striking out, they win the amount in pounds of the total | Question: Who presented Family Fortunes in the two years between Bob Monkhouse and Les Dennis?', ['max bygraves'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-287'), ('Context: Honda first adopted the Si badge for the Japanese domestic market ( JDM ) third - generation Civic in November 1984 . Mainly offered in hatchback form , the main aesthetic difference for the Si was a slight bulge in the hood , which accommodated the taller DOHC engine . A four - door sedan variant also existed in Japan , but was only produced in small numbers and is rare . Designated as ZC1 in Japan and D16A1 in Europe , the new engine put out 118 hp ( 88 kW ) , enabling the car to hit 122 mph ( 196 km / h ) and go from 0 -- 60 mph in 8.9 seconds . Since compact cars at the time typically made less than 100 hp ( 75 kW ) , the Si proved popular amongst enthusiasts . In 1986 , the Si trim was extended to the Civic hatchback , offering the same powertrain of the CRX Si but with four - seats . Added improvements for the Civic Si hatchback included a removable glass sunroof , a five - speed manual gearbox , tilt steering wheel , a full - width taillight panel , a color - keyed front airdam , sedan - style disk wheel covers , and a roof spoiler .

In a diploid cell there are two sets of homologous chromosomes of different parental origin ( e.g. a paternal and a maternal set ) . During the phase of meiosis labeled `` interphase s '' in the meiosis diagram there is a round of DNA replication , so that each of the chromosomes initially present is now composed of two copies called chromatids . These chromosomes ( paired chromatids ) then pair with the homologous chromosome ( also paired chromatids ) present in the same nucleus ( see prophase I in the meiosis diagram ) . The process of alignment of paired homologous chromosomes is called synapsis ( see Synapsis ) . During synapsis , genetic recombination usually occurs . Some of the recombination events occur by crossing over ( involving physical exchange between two chromatids ) , but most recombination events involve information exchange but not physical exchange between two chromatids ( see Synthesis - dependent strand annealing ( SDSA ) ) .

The Second World War was far from over, yet those countries were looking for ways and means to reconstruct their systems of education once peace was restored. Very quickly, the project gained momentum and soon took on a universal note. New governments, including that of the United States, decided to join in.  Upon the proposal of CAME, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945. Scarcely had the war ended when the conference opened. It gathered together the representatives of forty-four countries who decided to create an organization that would embody a genuine culture of peace. In their eyes, the new organization must establish the “intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind” and, in so doing, prevent the outbreak of another world war.  At the end of the conference, thirty-seven countries founded the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Constitution of UNESCO , signed on 16 November 1945, came into force on 4 November 1946 after ratification by twenty countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Lebanon, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States. The first session of the General Conference of UNESCO was held in Paris from 19 November to 10 December 1946 with the participation of representatives from 30 governments entitled to vote.  The political divisions of the Second World War\xa0marked the composition of the founding Member States of UNESCO. It was not until 1951 that Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany became Members, and Spain was accepted\xa0in 1953. Other major historical factors, such as the Cold War, the decolonization process and the dissolution of the USSR, also left their trace on UNESCO. The USSR joined UNESCO in 1954 and was replaced by the Russian Federation in 1992 alongside 12 former Soviet republics. Nineteen African states became Members in the 1960s.  As a consequence of its entry into the United Nations, the People's Republic of China has been the only legitimate representative of China at UNESCO since 1971. The German Democratic Republic was a Member from 1972 to 1990, when it joined the Federal Republic of Germany.  Some countries\xa0withdrew from\xa0the\xa0Organization for political reasons at various points in time, but they have today all rejoined UNESCO.

Please direct any interview requests or policy questions to our media and public relations staff at newsroom@entnet.org .  Good intentions to keep ears clean may weaken the ability to hear. The ear is a delicate and intricate body part, including the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum. Therefore, special care should be given to this part of the body. Start by discontinuing the habit of inserting cotton-tipped applicators or other objects into the ear canals.  Why does the body produce earwax?  Cerumen or earwax is healthy in normal amounts and serves as a self-cleaning agent with protective, lubricating, and antibacterial properties. The absence of earwax may result in dry, itchy ears. Self-cleaning means there is a slow and orderly movement of earwax and dead skin cells from the eardrum to the ear opening. Old earwax is constantly being transported, assisted by chewing and jaw motion, from the ear canal to the ear opening where, most of the time, it dries, flakes, and falls out.  Earwax is not formed in the deep part of the ear canal near the eardrum. It is only formed in the outer one-third of the ear canal. So, when a patient has wax blockage against the eardrum, it is often because he has been probing the ear with such things as cotton-tipped applicators, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only push the wax in deeper.  When should the ears be cleaned?  Under ideal circumstances, the ear canals should never have to be cleaned. However, that isn’t always the case. The ears should be cleaned when enough earwax accumulates to cause symptoms or to prevent a needed assessment of the ear by your doctor. This condition is call cerumen impaction, and may cause one or more of the following symptoms:  Earache, fullness in the ear, or a sensation the ear is plugged  Partial hearing loss, which may be progressive  Tinnitus, ringing, or noises in the ear  Itching, odor, or discharge  Coughing  What is the recommended method of ear cleaning?  To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal.  Most cases of ear wax blockage respond to home treatments used to soften wax. Patients can try placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil, glycerin, or commercial drops in the ear. Detergent drops such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide (available in most pharmacies) may also aid in the removal of wax.  Irrigation or ear syringing is commonly used for cleaning and can be performed by a physician or at home using a commercially available irrigation kit. Common solutions used for syringing include water and saline, which should be warmed to body temperature to prevent dizziness. Ear syringing is most effective when water, saline, or wax dissolving drops are put in the ear canal 15 to 30 minutes before treatment. Caution is advised to avoid having your ears irrigated if you have diabetes, a hole in the eardrum (perforation), tube in the eardrum, skin problems such as eczema in the ear canal or a weakened immune system.  Manual removal of earwax is also effective. This is most often performed by an otolaryngologist using suction or special miniature instruments, and a microscope to magnify the ear canal. Manual removal is preferred if your ear canal is narrow, the eardrum has a perforation or tube, other methods have failed, or if you have skin problems affecting the ear canal, diabetes or a weakened immune system.  Why shouldn't cotton swabs be used to clean earwax?  Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. This is often caused by attempts to clean the ear with cotton swabs. Most cleaning attempts merely push the wax deeper into the ear canal, causing a blockage.

In bays where they occur in very high numbers, predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods, which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are a vital part of marine food chains. One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population.

Saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food ; the saliva also contains mucus , which lubricates the food , and hydrogen carbonate , which provides the ideal conditions of pH ( alkaline ) for amylase to work . After undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus . It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis . Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion . Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin . As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall , mucus is secreted by the stomach , providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals .

We caught a few glimpses of the result early in Kill Bill Vol. 1 with the wreckage left behind when Bill and the Vipers assaulted a tiny rural chapel and slaughtered everyone in sight. Vol. 2 gives us, for the first time, a full account of the wedding rehearsal massacre that sets the plot of this two-part epic in motion. After fending off attacks from Bill’s trailer-trash kid brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and her chief rival within the Squad, Daryl Hannah’s Elle Driver, The Bride tracks her ultimate quarry to his lair in Mexico.  It might be a slight exaggeration to describe Kill Bill Vol. 2 as a “relationship movie.” But it may look like one, at times, in comparison with the wall-to-wall Asian swordplay action of Vol. 1 . Both films are still, as Carradine says, “kung-fu samurai Spaghetti Western love stories.” But as the actor noted in a recent published interview: “ The second one has got a lot more of what you’re used to from Quentin; the quirky character stuff, the surprises, the funny stuff.”  In Kill Bill Vol. 1 , actor David Carradine was almost entirely a sinister presence behind the scenes, a familiar, seductive, baritone voice murmuring on the soundtrack\xad—despite the fact that he played the movie’s title role. But along with Uma Thurman, who continues to cut a wide swath as the revenge-driven Bride, “David dominates Vol. 2 ,” according to writer-director Quentin Tarantino.  When I tell people the name of the movie is Kill Bill ,” Carradine says, “and that I’m Bill, they ask me: ‘Well, what are you, the bad guy?’ And I have to tell ’em, ‘There are no good guys in a Quentin Tarantino movie. It’s all about the bad guys.’ The essence of a Tarantino movie is an inside look at the minds and hearts of violent people. That’s what we go to see his movies for. It’s climbing inside these people’s psyches and showing what makes them tick. There’s a nobility about Bill, yet you also know he’s one of the most evil people you’ve ever met in your life. “Bill is more fun than anything,” Carradine recently told The Associated Press. “Bill has virtually no human problems. He’s just kind of put himself above it all.”  In Vol. 1 we learned that Bill, a broker of killers for hire, had assembled and trained a ruthless assortment of assassins, the so-called Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS). Each of these gifted murderers was code-named for a different species of poisonous snake: O’Ren-Ishii (Lucy Liu) was Cottonmouth, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) was California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) was Copperhead, and Budd (Michael Madsen), Bill’s kid brother and the only other male in the Viper Squad, was known as Sidewinder.  The lethal weapon known as Black Mamba, played by Thurman, the most talented of them all, was also Bill’s lover, and she became a fugitive from the assassination game when she learned that she was pregnant with his child. At that moment her worldview shifted on its axis. She no longer wanted to kill or to put her life in mortal danger. She changed her name, hid out in a small town, and found herself a kind and stable man to a marry.  But Bill was not about to let this situation stand.

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

The opening credits were originally accompanied by the song `` I Do n't Want to Be '' by Gavin DeGraw . The theme was removed from the opening in the fifth season ; Schwahn said that this was to lower production costs , to add more time for the storyline , and because he felt that the song was more representative of the core characters ' adolescent past than their present maturity .

Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the Mediterranean theatre , but his American allies , who were providing the bulk of the men and equipment , over-ruled him . British Lieutenant - General Frederick E. Morgan was appointed Chief of Staff , Supreme Allied Commander ( COSSAC ) , to begin detailed planning . The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing - craft , most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific . In part because of lessons learned in the Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942 , the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing . The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support , particularly close air support , and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore . The short operating - range of British aircraft such as the Spitfire and Typhoon greatly limited the number of potential landing - sites , as comprehensive air - support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible . Morgan considered four sites for the landings : Brittany , the Cotentin Peninsula , Normandy , and the Pas de Calais . As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas , the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus , so these sites were rejected . | Question: who came up with the d day invasion ?', ['British Lieutenant - General Frederick E.

By 1850 there were seven railway termini located around the urban centre of London and the concept of an underground railway linking the City of London with these stations was first proposed in the 1830s . Charles Pearson , Solicitor to the City of London , was a leading promoter of several schemes , and he contributed to the creation of the City Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King 's Cross in 1852 . Although the plan was supported by the City of London , the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed . In 1854 the Metropolitan Railway ( also known as the Met ) was granted permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of £ 1 million . With the Crimean War under way , the Met found it hard to raise the capital , and construction did not start until March 1860 . The railway was mostly built using the `` cut - and - cover '' method from Paddington to King 's Cross ; east of King 's Cross it was built by tunnelling and then followed the culverted River Fleet in an open cutting to the new meat market at Smithfield . The 3.75 - mile ( 6 km ) railway opened to the public on 10 January 1863 , using steam locomotives hauling wooden carriages . It was hailed as a success , carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day , borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service .

Reuters/Jim Young +  By Martyn Herman | WHISTLER  WHISTLER Amy Williams roared to Britain\'s first Olympic gold medal in an individual winter event since 1980 in the women\'s skeleton on Friday but had an anxious wait before Canada had an appeal against her helmet rejected.  The Canadians, whose own gold medal hope Mellisa Hollingsworth finished a tearful fifth, followed an earlier failed U.S. appeal against Williams\'s helmet which they said had illegal aerodynamic features.  Maybe the hosts were just bamboozled by the speed of Williams who had never won a World Cup race despite a silver medal the 2009 world championships.  The ice cool Queen of Speed smashed the women\'s course record on Thursday to hold the midway lead and went even faster in heat three with a new record of 53.68 to widen the gap to the chasing pack led by favorite Hollingsworth.  With a healthy 0.52-second cushion going into her fourth and final slide, Williams kept it clean through the 16 unforgiving curves to match the feat of Briton Robin Cousins who won the men\'s figure skating title in Lake Placid 30 years ago.  SPORTING HEROINE  "It\'s amazing, I feel like I\'m in a little bubble and not sure if it\'s real or not," the curly-haired Williams told Reuters as fans, some dressed as St George, waved Union Jacks in the grandstand and toasted their new sporting heroine.  "I knew I had to just keep it together. I can\'t remember what I did on the last run, half of the track is just a blur."  Hollingsworth\'s gold medal dream ended in despair when she crunched into a wall in the middle of her final run meaning Germany\'s Kerstin Szymkowiak took the silver, 0.56 seconds behind Williams, and compatriot Anja Huber the bronze.  "It is just really hard," Hollingsworth, this season\'s World Cup winner, said, tears streaking her red cheeks.  "I feel like I have let my entire country down. It could have happened anywhere, at a World Cup ... but it happened at the Olympic Games."  Williams, on a sled she calls Arthur, was unstoppable in all four runs, leading from start to finish, to become Britain\'s first gold medalist in a sliding sport since Anthony Nash and Robin Dixon in the two-man bobsleigh in 1964.  Former rower Steve Redgrave, Britain\'s most decorated Olympian, greeted Williams after her final slide to glory.

Contents  Synopsis  SPOILER: Plot details or story follow.  The McCallister family prepares to spend Christmas with Peter and Frank\'s brother Rob in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate\'s home in a suburb of Chicago the night before their flight. Eight-year-old Kevin, their youngest son, finds himself the subject of ridicule from his siblings and cousins. After getting into an argument with his older brother Buzz, he is sent to the third floor bedroom of the house, where he wishes his family would disappear. During the night, a power outage resets the alarm clocks and causes the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to reach the airport on time, Kevin is left behind and the family does not realize it until they are already airborne. Once in Paris, his mother and father desperately try to book a flight home.  Meanwhile, Kevin wakes up to find the house empty and is overjoyed to find that his wish came true. He takes Buzz\'s life savings, practices shooting with Buzz\'s BB gun, jumps on the bed, watches a gangster film, and eats a large amount of junk food. However, he finds himself scared by the appearance of the Chicago Police Department called by his parents to check on him, his next door neighbor "Old Man" Marley, who was rumored to have murdered his family many years earlier, and the appearance of the Wet Bandits, Harry Lyme and Marv Merchants, who are breaking into other vacant houses on the block.  On Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears Harry and Marv discussing plans for breaking into his house that night. After conversing with a Santa Claus impersonator and watching a local choir perform in a church, he comes across Marley. The two of them talk, and he learns that Marley is in fact a very nice man and the rumors about him are not true. He tells Kevin he is watching the choir because his granddaughter is in it, and he never gets to see her because he and his son have not spoken in years after a big argument they had. Kevin advises him to reconcile with his son.  His own spirits lifted by encouraging Marley, Kevin heads home and sets up various booby traps inside the house. Harry and Marv break in. After the two spring every trap in the house, Kevin flees to the second floor of the house and dials 911. They chase him out of the house, and he flees to the vacant neighboring home. The Wet Bandits catch him when he runs to the top of the stairs and hang him on a coat hook on the door. Marley sneaks up behind them and knocks them out with a snow shovel before taking Kevin home. Shortly after, Harry and Marv are arrested.  Kevin wakes up the next morning and is disappointed to see that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house, calling for him. He goes downstairs, and the two of them meet and reconcile. Immediately after, the rest of the McCallisters, having traveled directly from Paris to Chicago, arrive. Kevin and Buzz have a moment of reconciliation. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry\'s missing gold tooth and wonders what it is. Kevin then goes over to the window and sees Marley greeting his son and his family. While Marley is hugging his granddaughter, he looks up to see Kevin, and waves to him (as a sign of thanking him). Kevin waves back, grinning also, and watches as Marley heads inside with his family. However, Buzz interrupts Kevin\'s musings by calling out, "Kevin! What did you do to my room?"  Kevin immediately runs off probably to Buzz\'s room or somewhere in the house, and the film ends.  Spoilers end here.

Displaying considerable    talent from a very early age, he was assistant organist at the small local church by the time he was ten. In 1836,    Verdi completed his first opera, "Rocester." The music from this work only survives in the composer\'s next opera,    "Oberto, Conte di San Bonifacio," which opened at La Scala in 1839. His next opera, "Un Giorno di Regno" ("King for a    Day"), was a complete failure and resolved Verdi to cancel his La Scala contract and give up music altogether.    The manager of La Scala, Bartolomeo Merelli, persuaded him to persevere and write his next opera - "Nabucodonosor"    ("Nebuchadnezzar"). This opera came to be called "Nabucco" and premiered in 1842 to great acclaim. His next two operas    - "I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata" and "Ernani" - secured Verdi\'s reputation as a major figure in the music world.    Between 1844 and 1850 Verdi composed at a tremendous rate. "Luisa Miller" in 1849 and "Stiffelio" in 1850 demonstrate    Verdi\'s maturing style and more flowing musical line. During his "middle period" Verdi wrote three of his most    successful operas: "Rigoletto," "Il Trovatore," and "La Traviata." In 1859, Verdi wrote "Un Ballo in Maschera" which,    like several of his other works, aroused the ire of the censors who objected to the representation of a rebellion    against a monarch. From 1861-65, after Napoleon III drove the Austrians from northern Italy, Verdi was elected to    represent Busseto in the newly-formed Italian parliament. During this time he wrote "La Forza del Destino" and "Don    Carlos."  In 1870, he accepted a commission to write an opera for the opening of the Suez Canal. The opera, "Aida," premiered    in both Cairo and Milan in 1871. Following the success of "Aida," Verdi retired to his estate Sant\'Agnata. In 1875,    the death of the great Italian novelist and patriot Alessandro Manzoni moved Verdi to complete a requiem mass that    had originally been intended to honor his noted compatriot, Gioacchino Rossini.  Verdi was drawn back to the opera    by his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, who introduced him to the celebrated Arrigo Boito. They both worked together on    "Otello," which premiered at La Scala in 1886. Verdi\'s last opera was the only other comedy he had written since the    disastrous "Un Giorno di Regno" - "Falstaff," considered Verdi\'s humanistic swan song.  In January, 1901, Verdi became    ill while staying in Milan. City officials spread the streets around his hotel with straw so that the sound of the    horses\' hooves would not disturb him. He passed away on January 27, 1901, and was buried at the Casa di Riposo, a    retirement home for elderly musicians that was established by Verdi himself.  - from the New York City Opera  The Creation of Falstaff  "It is not often that a man\'s strength is so immense that he can remain an athlete after bartering half of it to    old age for experience; but the thing happens occasionally, and need not so greatly surprise us in Verdi\'s case,"   said George Bernard Shaw of "Falstaff." By the 1890s, even after some 15 years of retirement from opera, Verdi\'s    reputation as the preeminent composer of Italian opera was as secure as it had been for decades. After the premiere    of "Otello" in 1887, the world assumed it had heard its last from Verdi. But in 1893, he astonished everyone by    ending his operatic career with a return to a genre that had previously | Question: Whose last opera was Falstaff?', ['giuseppe verdi', 'verdi'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5526'), ('Context: A rotating wheel space station is a hypothetical wheel - shaped space station that rotates about its axis , thus creating an environment of artificial gravity .

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread.

This period was known as the ‘golden age’ of Australian tennis.  In the 1960s, men's tennis open titles were dominated by six Australian men: Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Ken Rosewall, and Fred Stolle. Between 1961 and 1970, Australian men's tennis champions won at least one Open Singles title every year at either Wimbledon or the French or US Opens, as well as the Australian Open titles. In men's tennis, the golden age culminated in 1969 with Rod Laver's second Grand Slam win, as well as four major titles in the same year.  Margaret Court, courtesy of Australian Open  In 1970, Margaret Court also completed the Grand Slam. Court is one of only three women ever to win four international tennis open titles in one year. Indigenous player Evonne Goolagong Cawley was also a strong force in women's tennis in Australia in the 1970s with wins at Wimbledon, the French and the Australian Opens.  The ‘golden age’ for Australian tennis players declined from 1969 when amateur players were joined by professionals. Also by the 1980s, the Australian Open synchronised its dates to begin in January in line with the European, UK and USA players events schedule, which greatly widened the pool of players.  Yet even following the decline of Australia's dominance in the Grand Slam tournaments, tennis remained popular in urban areas and the Australian Open grows in popularity as a spectator sport.  Early tennis development 1900s–1950s  The golden age of Australian tennis was built on the early successes of both men's and women's tennis with Grand Slam tournament winners: Norman Brookes in the 1900s to 1919, Jack Crawford in the early 1930s, and Harry Hopman from 1929–39. This was in tandem with the consistent wins and popularity of women's tennis from the 1920s to the 1950s. Daphne Akhurst reached the Wimbledon final in 1925 and won the Doubles in 1928. From the1930s to the 1950s, Nancy Bolton got to the USA Singles Open and won other titles with her doubles partner, Thelma Long. Bolton was ranked No.4 in 1947 and stayed in that position until 1949.  This series of wins in the amateur Grand Slam tournament titles of the 1940s and 1950s was made possible by extensive community and industry support, and investment in the development and administration of amateur tennis players.  Harry Hopman, courtesy of Australian Open  Harry Hopman was a captain turned coach of 22 Australian Davis Cup teams between 1939 and 1967. As coach Hopman guided Australian male tennis players to 15 Davis Cup victories in 20 years. Ken Rosewall, Frank Sedgeman, John Bromwich, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Lew Hoad and Margaret Smith Court were all either trained by Harry Hopman or managed by Nell Hopman. ( The Hopman Era: Australia on the Rise)  Amateurs, tennis community and industry in the 1960s  By 1969 the game started to change. Professional players were invited to join the amateurs at the Grand Slam tournaments and prize money was offered for the first time, different tennis court surfaces and different game strategies emerged, and metal racquets were introduced.  Professional versus amateur  In 1969, the Australian Open Championships became 'open' to amateurs and professionals. This followed in the footsteps of the French Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, UK, and the USA Open. Rod Laver returned to win his second grand slam in 1969.  The advantages to amateur Australian champions who had enjoyed the riches of the Davis Cup endorsements soon disappeared with the advent of ‘open’ tennis.

B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY     1900  •S     Anthony van Dyck.      aking into consideration the intellectual life of the  Flemish and of the Dutch in general, the painters are  undoubtedly the most gifted of our countrymen. The  taste for Art was most lavishly bestowed upon them,  they have been the creating genius of our race, men with  keener eyes and more subtle feeling and with a hand more cunning  than the majority of their "fellow countrymen. They have been  instrumental in bringing the people of the low-lying countries to the  fore, causing them to rank amongst the highest in the Ideal world.  Now the most poetical of these painters was Anthony van Dyck, that is  to say if one understands by that word « poetical » a certain suscep-  tibility for impressions, and an inclination to be touched by emotions,  as may be termed sorrowful, suffering and tender.   Van Dyck was endowed with more feeling than strength, he  offered apparently but little resistance to the influence of others, yet  his natural disposition and his fine artistic taste were not submerged  by the powerful impression made on him by his illustrious prede-  cessors. These impressions, it may be said, he outgrew rather than  threw off, and drifted unconsciously into an independence which  ripened and matured through the increasing power of his matchless  talent. Born in Antwerp, of the bluest blood, he loved his native town  and with true artistic feeling was carried away and enraptured by  all that may be called beautiful, brilliant and glowing ; he surpassed  all others by the sensibility of his character, by the distinction of his  style, by his power to charm and by his love of the eminent. The  tender graceful sensitiveness of his nature made him a striking contrast  to and a protest against that boorishness and sluggishness, which are  considered by some the characteristics of our nation.   Such van Dyck appears to us as artist when we take a broad and     impartial view of him, but upon a nearer acquaintance his talents  become more sharply defined, especially when viewed by the glimpses  we get of his life and from a closer examination of his work.   So too he appears to us as a man : of noble exterior, conscious of  his own worth, speaking by the spirit that vibrates through his whole  being and which overshadows his surroundings through the charm  of his personality. He looks what he is, the portrayer of princes, of  eminent men and of noble ladies, of Madonnas and Saints, and above  all the painter of the Man of Sorrows and the Mother of Woe.

It restricted opening hours for licensed premises to luncheon ( 12 : 00 to 14 : 40 ) and supper ( 18 : 30 to 21 : 30 ) . In the late 1980s the licensing laws in England and Wales became less restricted and allowed pubs to allow the consumption of alcohol on the premises from 11 : 00 until 23 : 00 , although nightclubs were allowed to stay open much later . Significantly revised rules were introduced in November 2005 , when hour limits were scrapped , and pubs were allowed to apply for licences as permissive as `` 24 hours a day '' .

Changes include the development of the Hillsborough stadium, players, the board and the general infrastructure of the club.  Owls fans already know, Sheffield Wednesday is more than a football club. Sheffield Wednesday is a symbol. The blue and white stripes, the ‘Owl’ and the motto ‘Consilio et Animis’ (Wisdom and courage) are just some representations of the club that are seen throughout the UK each time the players step onto the playing turf.  As Wednesday fans, we are all part of the S6 family. Mascot, Ozzie the Owl, is one well known Hillsborough icon known by the fans young and old. Ozzie the Owl is often seen before, during and post-match.  Ozzie was an ever present as matchday mascot from 1990 to 2006. He was then reintroduced in 2009, a home league fixture to Charlton Athletic in January of that year. Initially, Ozzie the Owl was a character created by Ruben Grossman back in 1949, appearing in the ‘Funny Folks’ publication.  This week I\xa0caught up with Ozzie the Owl to question him on the past, present and future of Sheffield Wednesday.  Q: When and how did you become a Sheffield Wednesday mascot?  A:\xa01999/2000 season, recommendation from a friend at the club.  Q: How do you and fellow mascot Barney prepare for a match day?  A: Nothing special, make sure we drink plenty of water as dehydration is a concern.  We meet up about 1:30 and work out where we need to visit.  Q: Besides matchday, what other opportunities arise as a Sheffield Wednesday mascot?  A: Mascot Races, Parties, Charity Events, Owls in the Park to name a few.  Q: What is the best thing about being a Sheffield Wednesday mascot?  A: I get to be part of the club I love and support.  Q: Current favourite Sheffield Wednesday player and why?  A: Keiren Westwood. In my playing days I was a keeper, so I always appreciate a great keeper.  Q: Favourite ever Sheffield Wednesday player and why?  A: Following on from my previous answer, has to be the legend that is Kevin Pressman! He is the reason I became a keeper.  Q: Best Sheffield Wednesday moment at Hillsborough?  A: From a personal point of view the promotion game against Wycombe. All four sides of the great stadium full of Wednesday fans in party mode! An atmosphere never to be forgotten.  Q: Best game you have seen at Hillsborough?  A: The recent 6-0 demolition of Leeds sticks in my mind.  Q: Best goal you have seen at Hillsborough?  A: The one that springs to mind is Di Piedi’s overhead kick vs Sunderland in the League Cup.  Q: Expectations this season?  A: It would be brilliant to get automatic promotion, but a play-off place should be achievable. Top 10 should be the minimum aim.  Q: Where do you see Sheffield Wednesday in three\xa0years?  A: In the Premier League!!!  Hopefully we will see mascots Ozzie & Barney long into the future at Hillsborough as we continue to take progressive forward steps towards the Premier League.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ozzie for taking the time to answer my questions. You can contact Ozzie on twitter,\xa0 @O22IE_OWL , and his partner in crime Barney,\xa0 @BarneyOwl67 .  Look out for them both on Saturday 3rd October, as Sheffield Wednesday take on Preston North End at home. Be sure to say ‘hi’ and grab a photo.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.  Special relationships exist between the measures of consecutive angles, opposite angles and opposite sides of a parallelogram. A square is the most straightforward parallelogram, because it has 2 sets of parallel sides. Naturally, all of its angles and sides match in length or measure.  Facts About a Parallelogram  (1) The degree measure of the four angles of a parallelogram add up to 360 degrees. Remember that all quadrilaterals (4 sided figures) have angles which add up to 360 degrees. Here's a sample:  Then: a + b + c + d = 360 degrees  (2) The degree measure of any two consecutive angles add up to 180 degrees.                 In parallelogram ABCD:  angle a + angle b = 180 degrees  angle b + angle c = 180 degrees  angle c + angle d = 180 degrees  angle a + angle d = 180 degrees  (3) Opposite angles have the same measure in terms of degrees.  In parallelogram ABCD:  (1) Opposite sides are parallel:  side AD || side BC  NOTE: The symbol || means parallel.  (2) Opposite sides have the same lengths:  side AD = side BC  side AB = side CD  Diagonals of a Parallelogram  The diagonals of a parallelogram divide the parallelogram into two side-by-side triangles.  As shown in the picture below, diagonal AC forms equal alternate interior angles with each pair of parallel sides.  We can also see that there are two triangles in the picture below.  Triangle 1 is congruent to triangle 2 by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Method.  Where did the two triangles come from?  They were formed by diagonal AC.  I should also note that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other as shown in the picture below.  AE = EC  where E is the midpoint of BOTH diagonals.

It lived and nested on the ground and ate fruits that had fallen from trees. There were no mammals on the island and a high diversity of bird species lived in the dense forests.  In 1505, the Portuguese became the first humans to set foot on Mauritius. The island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade. Weighing up to 50 pounds, the dodo bird was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors. Large numbers of dodo birds were killed for food.  Later, when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony, pigs and monkeys were brought to the island along with the convicts. Many of the ships that came to Mauritius also had uninvited rats aboard, some of which escaped onto the island.  Before humans and other mammals arrived the dodo bird had little to fear from predators. The rats, pigs and monkeys made short work of vulnerable dodo bird eggs in the ground nests.  The combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced dodo bird populations. Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius, the once abundant dodo bird was a rare bird.  The last dodo bird was killed in 1681.  Although the tale of the dodo bird’s demise is well documented, no complete specimens of the bird were preserved; there are only fragments and sketches. The dodo bird is just one of the bird species driven to extinction on Mauritius. Many others were lost in the 19th century when the dense Mauritian forests were converted into tea and sugar plantations.  Of the 45 bird species originally found on Mauritius, only 21 have managed to survive.  Although the dodo bird became extinct in 1681, its story is not over. We are just beginning to understand the effects of its extinction on the ecosystem.  Recently a scientist noticed that a certain species of tree was becoming quite rare on Mauritius. In fact, he noticed that all 13 of the remaining trees of this species were about 300 years old. No new trees had germinated since the late 1600s.  Since the average life span of this tree was about 300 years, the last members of the species were extremely old. They would soon die, and the species would be extinct. Was it just a coincidence that the tree had stopped reproducing 300 years ago and that the dodo bird had become extinct 300 years ago? No.  It turns out that the dodo bird ate the fruit of this tree, and it was only by passing through the dodo’s digestive system that the seeds became active and could grow. Now, more than 300 years after one species became extinct, another was to follow as a direct consequence. Will more follow?  Luckily, some creative people discovered that domestic turkey gullets sufficiently mimic the action of the dodo bird’s digestive system. They have used turkeys to begin a new generation of the tree, which is now called the dodo tree. If these seedlings survive to produce their own seeds, the species will be saved.  Questions for Thought:  Mauritius is a medium-sized island that is extremely far away from any mainland. What does Island biogeography suggest about such places?  Birds and bats are frequently responsible for the natural pollination and seed dispersal of trees. What will their extinctions and endangerment mean for the forests where they live?

Susan Bullock  Share on Messenger  Close  Gloriana was given its world premiere on 8 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House, before an invited audience of diplomats and dignitaries from all over the world. Acclaimed in the UK and internationally for Peter Grimes (1945), and with Billy Budd (1951) also a huge success, Britten wrote his next and ninth opera in honour of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It caused quite a stir, but not the kind of stir that a composer necessarily wants. Britten had collaborated with librettist William Plomer on the story of Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex (based on Lytton Strachey \'s 1928 book Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History ). Their opera depicts Queen Elizabeth I as an all-too-human woman torn between her sense of duty as the monarch and her illicit love for the headstrong Essex, who ultimately betrayed her trust, leading her to condemn him to death.  Think back 60 years to 1953. There were no fly-on-the-wall TV documentaries about the royal family or Hello magazines charting their every move. The monarchy were far more distant and inaccessible. Duty was everything.  Therefore to see a queen portrayed as a flawed human being with real feelings of love for a much younger man was deemed scandalous and insulting. The audience would have been expecting an opera that extolled the vitues of Queen Elizabeth I and which would in turn glorify the young Queen Elizabeth II. There was a lukewarm response from both the first night audience and critics. Sadly the work has always been stigmatised by this lacklustre reaction, and even though Britten wrote that the young Queen had in fact been "delighted and flattered" by the private performance of the piece given at the home of Lord Harewood before the official premiere, and that subsequent performances were well attended and enthusiastically received, the composer felt "kicked around" by the initial response to Gloriana. In marked contrast to his other operas, there has since been relatively few productions of this opera.  Susan Bullock (centre) as Queen Elizabeth I in Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, June 2013. Photograph: Clive Barda  This month, I\'m singing the ageing, procrastinating and troubled Queen this time, in the Royal Opera House\'s new staging that marks the Queen\'s diamond jubilee year. To find the fine line between playing a monarch and a woman torn apart by her love for a much younger man is very challenging. In researching my role I\'ve looked at many paintings of Elizabeth I at various stages of her life, and it is well documented that she was a highly intelligent woman, accomplished in several languages, witty and at times very sharp-tempered. The David Starkey TV series on Elizabeth I was very informative, and Glenda Jackson \'s portrayal of the Queen was outstanding in the BBC\'s Elizabeth R .  By basing their text on Strachey\'s book, himself a radical biographer, infamous for looking at icons of history in a new way, Britten and Plomer place the soprano singing Elizabeth I right in the heart of this great historical figure. The scene where Essex rushes in to the Queen\'s bedroom unannounced on his return from Ireland, finding her in a state of undress without her wig or make up is a particularly powerful one in both the book and opera. The reaction of the Queen is hugely affecting – she is at once surprised, shocked, distressed, and then very angry because of Essex\'s failure to beat the rebel Earl of Tyrone.

Following the first abolition of the Greek monarchy, Philip was forced into exile with his poverty-stricken parents; he was famously carried in a makeshift cot made from an orange box.  Most of Philip\'s early life was spent moving from home to home. In adulthood, he became an officer in the Royal Navy, when he married the then-Princess Elizabeth, in 1947.\xa0Although he was born a prince of Greece and Denmark, he renounced those titles when he became a British citizen in 1947, and adopted the surname Mountbatten, an Anglicized version of Battenberg which came from his mother\'s side of the family.  On that occasion he was also created Duke of Edinburgh by his new father-in-law, King George VI. In 1957, he was given the title Prince Philip.\xa0His full title is now HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich.  Unlike Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, Philip was not given the title of Prince Consort. His children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, all share a surname of Mountbatten-Windsor, given to the children in honour of their father, by Queen Elizabeth, by an Order-in-Council in 1960. However, the Royal House name remains Windsor.  As consort to the Queen, Philip\'s responsibilities include supporting his queen in her duties as sovereign, and he is normally seen accompanying her to ceremonies including the State Opening of Parliament and overseas state visits. Philip is not only the longest-serving consort, but also the oldest serving spouse of a reigning monarch. He holds a number of royal titles, including Prince of the United Kingdom, which was bestowed upon him by the Queen in 1957.  Like other members of the royal family, Philip is linked to a number of charitable ventures through his patronage. He is either patron or president of 800 organisations covering a wide range of areas, including science, technological research and development, sport, welfare of young people and conservation and the environment. Over the course of his public life, Prince Philip has visited research stations and laboratories across the UK, as well as coalmines, factories, engineering works and industrial plants.  He was the first president of World Wildlife Fund - UK from its formation in 1961 to 1982, and international president of the organisation, which later changed to the World Wide Fund for Nature, from 1981 to 1996. His links with the body continue to date in his capacity as president emeritus. The Duke of Edinburgh is also associated with the UK higher education sector, having served as chancellor of the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Salford and Wales in the past. He is a life governor of King\'s College, London and patron of London Guildhall University.  Being an airman, Prince Philip boasts nearly 6,000 flying hours as a pilot through experience accumulated from 1952 to 1997. He is also patron of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators of the British Empire and has been Master of Trinity House since 1969.  His successful career, role beside the Queen and commendable public engagements notwithstanding, Prince Philip is also famous for his knack for providing unsavoury gaffes. He is particularly known in Britain for regularly causing offence with bigoted comments whilst on public visits. For example, when visiting China in 1986, he told a group of British students that they had better not stay there too long or they would get "slitty-eyed".  Many more have been uttered over the years and one cannot rule out another mistake during any future engagements!

What’s the ...Espresso, Mocha, Latte Cappuccino, Americano? What’s the Difference? | Coal Creek Coffee  Espresso, Mocha, Latte Cappuccino, Americano? What’s the Difference?  11 May  Categories: Coffee  There’s nothing like a smooth cup of coffee first thing in the morning. Coffee jump-starts your day. It also is a treat to some who like to savor the flavor of different blends. When you walk into your local coffee shop and see this huge menu you wonder, is there really a difference between all these different types of drinks?  Let me enlighten you about what exactly goes into the making of each of these gourmet coffee drinks.  Espresso  Espresso is a very strong, finely ground dark coffee. It is made in a special coffee maker and is packed into a metal filter that sends pressurized water through it making a superb coffee. Espresso is served in smaller portions, generally in one or 2-ounce cups. For those who feel the taste is too bitter, a cube of sugar usually accompanies it.  Mocha  Mocha usually is any type of espresso drink with a shot of chocolate in it. There are a few different ways you can make this. Either you can put a few pumps or squirts of chocolate syrup into your espresso or you can add some hot chocolate mix to it. The choice is really up to the creator of the drink. Both ways are tasty.  Latte  A latte consists of steamed milk poured on top of an espresso. There is no foam consistency to it. Basically, it’s espresso mixed with milk. It’s not fancy but gives a creamy taste to an otherwise bitter espresso.  Cappuccino  When you think of cappuccino, you usually associate that with foam. Cappuccino is made with espresso and then foam is scooped onto the top. The foam is usually made with the steam coming out of a lever on the espresso machine. I like to sprinkle a little cinnamon to add an extra pizzazz to my cappuccino.  Americano  This type of espresso is a watered down form of a regular espresso. For those of you who can’t handle the intense strength of espresso, an Americano allows you to enjoy the flavorful taste of espresso but at a fraction of the strength. It is made by either filtering water onto espresso or pouring water into the already brewed cup. Whichever way it’s made, the outcome is the same.  So now that you’ve gotten the basic terms of espresso drinking down, you should be able to dive into your local coffee house and decipher the menu, right? Nope, not true at all. Under each of these specialty coffees, there are even more terms to break those up. Here are a few definitions you may need to know before you order your drink.  Wet  When you refer to a “wet” cappuccino, it is understood that you would like half steamed milk and half foam in and on your drink.  Dry  Wait. How can a beverage be dry? In coffee-house speak, that just means you want foam. So in any other terms, you will not find steamed milk in your drink. Once you drink away all that foam, it will just be a black cup of espresso.  Skinny  No this does not mean this drink will melt your pounds away. When you ask for a “skinny” latte or cappuccino, it means for your barista to use skim milk.  Now mind you, not all coffee is created equal, and every coffee-house interprets espresso making differently, so don’t take my word for it. Scope out the atmosphere and see what other people are ordering. Are you in the mood for a sweet treat or would you rather be amped up on caffeine for that all night writing or jam session? Whatever your reasoning for your coffee outing enjoy it and don’t forget the advice I gave you today.

For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 °C (68 °F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building.

This was the first (and so far the only) World Cup to be hosted by two countries.  At the time the decision was made, Japan had never qualified for a World Cup finals (although the Japanese did subsequently qualify for the 1998 competition). The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022. (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament. They were defending Olympic champions from 1928).  The unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone. With games taking place in the European morning, some schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up communal watching events before the start of work.  2002 FIFA World Cup Qualification  Main article: 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification  A total of 199 teams | Question: In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, which national football team became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the World Cup semi-finals?', ['south korea', 'south koreans'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1353'), ("Context: The British Empire comprised the dominions , colonies , protectorates , mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states .

It’s a wise saying that few in the tech industry seem to live by. But it’s alright, we don’t mind. The big names’ desire to capitalize on a competitor’s misfortune is often a source of hilarity.  Take #bendgate. By now, you probably know that simply walking around with an iPhone 6 Plus in your pocket could bend it , sometimes irremediably. In typical Internet fashion, the issue spiraled into a storm of 160-character quips, more or less witty memes, and deep social commentary from everyone and their grandma.  Apple’s got its share of snark and derision over #bendgate (or is it #bendghazi?). But you can count on rivals in the Android camp to make it even harder for the folks in Cupertino.

I’m sure you’re all familiar with it by now, but if not, BendGate was created from an alleged bending issue with Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. There’s a specific weak point on the inside of the chassis right beneath the volume buttons that allows it to bend very easily with pressure added in the right place. To most, it may seem like a non-issue, but a single video sparked one of the biggest viral moments this year in tech…  Lewis Hilsenteger from Unbox Therapy published the video that I’ve embedded below this article and that’s when it all got worse. In the video, Hilsenteger clearly bends an iPhone 6 Plus on camera and notes the specific weak point mentioned above. Of course, Hilsenteger (who is a friend and music collaborator ) had absolutely no idea that his video would cause the Internet to implode, but he assumed it would gain a decent amount of traction based on reports of the iPhone 6 Plus’ bendable properties that had been published earlier that day. 45 million views later, BendGate became a PR nightmare for Apple, somewhat of a conspiracy theory (which Hilsenteger debunked ), and a chance for mainstream media to show its true colors…  First off, let’s get one thing straight: The iPhone 6 Plus will bend if enough pressure is applied to a certain area. In fact, a lot of phones will bend when extreme pressure is applied. Everything has a weak point.

Edit  Storyline  Kirsty Wark Hosts live coverage of the prestigious Booker Prize, from Guildhall in London. This years winner is Australian-born Peter Carey for his novel "True History of the Kelly Gang"  The Booker prize | World news | The GuardianThe Booker prize | World news | The Guardian  Net notes  The Booker prize  After months of speculation and gossip, the literati will tonight find out which author has won the Booker prize. Here is the unabridged story of this top literary award  Share on Messenger  Close  1. The final chapter of the 2001 Booker prize opens tonight. At an exclusive literary dinner in the London Guildhall , the winner will be announced.  2. At the moment it\'s a two-horse race between Ian McEwan\'s Atonement and Peter Carey\'s A True History of the Kelly Gang . Both authors have won the prize before, but McEwan is narrowly leading in a Guardian Unlimited Books vote .  3. Though that is unlikely to sway the judges. According to inside gossip (former judge AL Kennedy ) the winner is invariably determined by "who knows who, who\'s sleeping with who, who\'s selling drugs to who, who\'s married to who, whose turn it is".  4. And of course, no one batted an eyelid. One of the greatest traditions of the Booker is the post-award spats between judges. Though Dr Julia Neuberger, on the panel in 1994, reached new heights when she described its final choice - James Kelman\'s How Late It Was, How Late as "crap".  5. For the first time this year the longlist was published, adding plenty more controversy: why did Beryl Bainbridge not make the shortlist? Does the award have a problem with children\'s books ?  6. Booker , the company that gave its name to the prize, does not deal with such matters in its day-to-day business life. It is a cash and carry company owned by the frozen food giant Iceland.  7. But Iceland is keen to scale down its involvement in the award, maybe coming to the inevitable conclusion that its subsidiary did not gain enormously from its association with last year\'s winner, Margaret Atwood\'s The Blind Assassin.  8. The triumphant author gets a £21,000 cheque and plenty of publicity, but the Booker is no guarantee of enduring fame. The first novel to scoop the prize in 1969 - PH Newby\'s Something to answer for - is currently out of print .  9. Other novels in the running this year are David Mitchell\'s number9dream, Ali Smith\'s Hotel World and Rachel Seiffert\'s The Dark Home, which may give you something to talk about.  10. None, however, are a patch on G , a novel by John Berger, that holds the rare distinction of being the winning novel in with the shortest title. For a while it was also out of print.

They called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the name, whose precise origin is contested, nevertheless indicates the chief source of their inspiration. Disenchanted with contemporary academic painting—most of them were colleagues at the Royal Academy of Art and famously disparaged the Academy’s founding president, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), as “Sir Sloshua”—the Brotherhood instead emulated the art of late medieval and early Renaissance Europe until the time of Raphael, an art characterized by minute description of detail, a luminous palette of bright colors that recalls the tempera paint used by medieval artists, and subject matter of a noble, religious, or moralizing nature. In mid-nineteenth-century England, a period marked by political upheaval, mass industrialization, and social ills, the Brotherhood at its inception strove to transmit a message of artistic renewal and moral reform by imbuing their art with seriousness, sincerity, and truth to nature.  At London’s Royal Academy and Free Exhibition shows of 1849, several paintings were exhibited with the cryptic initials “P.R.B.” along with the artists’ signatures; among these were Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother, Slain in a Skirmish between the Colonna and Orsini Factions (private collection) by William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Isabella (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) by John Everett Millais (1829–1896), and the Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate, London) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). These canvases, though diverse in subject, embodied the Brotherhood’s initial aims in their keen observation of the natural world and depiction of subjects that lead the viewer to contemplate moral issues of justice, piety, familial relationships, and the struggle of purity against corruption.  Hunt’s work illustrates a passage from a popular Victorian novel, set in fourteenth-century Rome, by Bulwer Lytton, and is characterized by a careful description of the outdoor setting. Millais’ Isabella is based on John Keats’ retelling of a story from Boccaccio’s Decameron; the artist re-creates in sumptuous detail the tastes and textures of a medieval banquet, from the creased tablecloth strewn with nutshells to guests at the grandly arrayed gathering. In his portrayal of the life of the Virgin, Rossetti employs an archaizing style and symbolic elements associated with early Renaissance painting: the lily , representing purity, the dove of the Holy Spirit, and the cruciform trellis. Other founding members of the Brotherhood—James Collinson (1825–1881; he resigned after converting to Catholicism in 1850), William Michael Rossetti (1829–1919), Frederic George Stephens (1827–1907), and the sculptor Thomas Woolner (1825–1892)—exhibited less frequently than its three prolific leading members.  The works of the Pre-Raphaelites met with critical opposition to their pietism, archaizing compositions, intensely sharp focus—which, with an absence of shadows, flattened the depicted forms—and the stark coloration they achieved by painting on a wet white ground. They had, however, several important champions.

When I originally posted the treatment for a movie based on the un-filmed Bond novel (the film of the same name is not based on Ian Fleming’s novel) I promised a similar idea based on Moonraker. Better late than never here it is after three years.  So you think you know Moonraker? As the great Ross McG from Ross v Ross once said, ‘Oh, Star Wars is huge! Lets put Bond in space with Moonraker!’ That’s not far off the mark. But back in 1955, just ten years after World War II and during the Cold War Ian Flemings’s third Bond novel was very different. The only way this would work as a movie would be to reboot the series and set the movie in the 1950’s, something I have wanted to see for a long time.  M asks Bond to join him at his club, Blades to sit in a game of bridge. Millionaire businessman Sir Hugo Drax has been winning a lot of money, M suspects him of cheating and wants to know why. Bond confirms M’s suspicions and turns the tables by cheating himself winning a large sum of money.  The mysterious Drax was a British soldier who made his fortune in the aerospace industry after being injured and suffering amnesia during World War II. A national hero because of his backing for the Moonraker project, Britain’s first nuclear missile intended as a nuclear deterrent during the cold war. (Britain’s first nuclear missile the Blue Streak was actually announced around the time the novel was published). Bond is sent to Drax’s factory near Dover to replace security officer working on the project who was shot dead. While there he meets Gala Brand, a beautiful (isn’t everyone in the Bond world) Special Branch agent working undercover as Drax’s personal assistant. It appears Bonds predecessor was killed to stop him revealing a sighting of a submarine off the coast. Bond also makes the surprising discovery (remember this is only ten years after the war) that all the scientists working on the Moonraker project are German. Meanwhile, Gala discovers the truth about the Moonraker, its first test flight will be aimed at the heart of London fitted with a Soviet nuclear warhead. She is captured and imprisoned in the building containing a beacon the missile will be aimed at.  Bond’s attempt to rescue Gala fails resulting in his capture and the destruction of his beloved Bentley. It is then that Drax, in true megalomaniac villain style reveals is back-story and his plans: he was not a British soldier and did not have amnesia. He was the leader of the commando unit (dressed in British uniform) that caused the explosion he was injured in. The amnesia, a cover story while he recovered in a British hospital. After the war he took up a new identity as cover but retained his Nazi beliefs and conceived the Moonraker to destroy London in revenge. In the process he also intends to make a killing on the stock market. To destroy all evidence Brand and Bond are moved to the area under the Moonraker’s engines just before it is fired. They promptly escape and with the help of Soviet Intelligence change the coordinates to redirect the Moonraker safely into the sea. Drax is killed attempting to escape in a Russian submarine. Bond meets up with Gala but is snubbed in favour of he fiancé.  So how have I come up with such a great story? Put simply I haven’t, this is not a treatment for a movie this is an overview of the plot lifted straight from the novel. So who would make it? Director Quentin Tarantino has often mentioned his interest in directing a Bond film. If anyone can make the 50’s setting work it is him. And to reboot the series again we need a new bond.

In 1997, Tony Blair won the biggest Labour victory in history to sweep the party to power and end 18 years of Conservative government. He has been one of the most dynamic leaders of modern times; few British prime ministers have shaped the nation’s course as profoundly as Tony Blair did, during his ten years in power. His achievements and his legacy will be debated for years to come. His memoirs reveal in intimate detail this unique political and personal journey and provide an insight into the man, the politician and the statesman, charting successes, controversies and disappointments with an extraordinary candour. They will prove essential and compulsive reading for anyone who wants to understand the complexities of our global world.  “Tony Blair’s The Journey will break new ground in prime ministerial memoirs just as Blair himself broke the mould of British politics,” said Rebuck.\xa0 “His book is frank, open, revealing and written in an intimate and accessible style.\xa0 As an account of the nature and uses of power, it will have a readership that extends well beyond politics, to all those who want to understand the challenge of leadership in today’s world.”  Tony\xa0Blair says: “I have really enjoyed the writing of the book. I have tried to write a book which describes the human as much as the political dimensions of life as Prime Minister. Though necessarily retrospective, it is an attempt to inform and shape current and future thinking as much as an historical account of the past. Most of all I want readers to have as much pleasure reading it as I had writing it.”  “Tony Blair is an extremely popular figure in North America,” said Sonny Mehta, his US publisher. “His memoir is refreshing, both for its candour and vivid portrayal of political life. We all knew Blair was an extraordinary statesman and gifted thinker. We can now add exceptional writer to that list.”  Hutchinson will publish Tony Blair: The Journey in hardback, priced £25.00 with a simultaneous edition available as an eBook and in audio, read by Mr Blair.\xa0 Knopf and Knopf Canada will publish their hardcover editions of Tony Blair: The Journey simultaneously with Hutchinson.

Johnson appoints a special commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which had occurred a week earlier, on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.  According to his memoirs and biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson knew he had to provide strong leadership in the wake of the shocking murder of President Kennedy. One of his first official acts was to initiate an investigation into the assassination. Johnson later wrote that, in the weeks after the assassination, the American public, and the government that he now headed was in a state of confusion and disorientation “like a bunch of cattle caught in a swamp.” He felt the weight of his new responsibility keenly “in a world that is never more than minutes away from catastrophe” and knew that “the whole world would be anxiously following every move I made.”  On November 29, Johnson issued Executive Order No. 11130, appointing the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy–commonly referred to as the Warren Commission, after its leader, Chief Justice Earl Warren. Since the president’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was himself killed by Jack Ruby almost immediately after Oswald killed Kennedy, details of Oswald’s motive for the assassination remained murky.  During its almost year-long investigation, the Warren Commission reviewed reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service, Department of State and the attorney general of Texas. It also poured over Oswald’s personal history, political affiliation and military record. Overall, the Warren Commission listened to the testimony of 552 witnesses and even traveled to Dallas several times to visit the site where Kennedy was shot. The commission concluded that Oswald had acted alone and that the Secret Service had made poor preparations for JFK’s visit to Dallas and had subsequently failed to sufficiently protect him.  The circumstances surrounding Kennedy’s death, however, have since given rise to several conspiracy theories involving such disparate characters as the Mafia, Cuban exiles, military leaders and even President Johnson. The Warren Commission’s conclusion that Oswald was a “lone gunman” failed to satisfy some who witnessed the attack and others whose research found conflicting details in the commission’s report. Critics of the Warren Commission’s report believed that additional ballistics experts’ conclusions and a home movie shot at the scene disputed the theory that three bullets fired from Oswald’s gun could have caused Kennedy’s fatal wounds as well as the injuries to Texas Governor John Connally, who was riding with the president in an open car as it traveled through Dallas’ Dealey Plaza that fateful day. So persistent was the controversy that another congressional investigation was conducted in 1979. That committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots that killed the president and that the Secret Service failed to protect Kennedy. It did, however, also allow for the possibility that a second gunman might have been involved, but did not pursue the matter further.

Strictly Come Dancing singer Hayley Sanderson, originally from Peterborough, has come a long way since her early days in the cast of many productions at Peterborough\'s Key Youth Theatre.She took time out from the hit dance show\'s national tour to speak to Ann Molyneux-Jackson.  AT the age of 12 when most girls are spending their pocket money on clothes and make-up, Hayley Sanderson splashed out on a PA system to further her singing career.  Even at such a tender age, she was determined to make her fortune from entertaining, and was already out performing at gigs with her uncle who was a musician.  It may have taken years of hard graft, but finally Hayley has made it, and is now a familiar voice to the millions of viewers who tune in to watch Strictly Come Dancing on a Saturday night as one of the four resident singers with the Dave Arch Orchestra.  The 27-year-old, who grew up in Peterborough and is a former pupil of Walton Comprehensive School, joined the BBC1 show, presented by Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, for series five three years ago, having previously worked with musical impressario Arch on the song Something In The Air for a Talk Talk commercial.  This was so successful that a single was released with the proceeds going to Treehouse, a charity for children with autism.  "I did a couple of adverts for Dave Arch including Something In The Air, which he arranged the strings on, then one of the singers pulled out of Strictly and he said, \'would you like the job?\'" Hayley said.  "It\'s the best seat in the house.  "We have a perfect view of the judges and we can see the dancers before they go on.  "Like everyone, I like to see what they are wearing. I absolutely love the outfits.  "But my favourite moments were seeing Shirley Bassey and Beyonce performing."  Appearing on a TV programme with so many viewers is bound to be a daunting prospect.  "This year more than the first two years I have been really nervous," said Hayley, who now lives near Chiswick, in London.  "I never saw the show before I started doing it but now I know how many people watch it.  "I can\'t see the seven million viewers, so that\'s not so bad. All we see is a small audience, so it\'s just like doing a gig, but we can\'t make mistakes because it could spoil the dance routine, so that adds a bit more pressure."  She added: "I don\'t get to see the dancers when I\'m singing so I watch them back when I get home and fast forward when I see myself."  Hayley and the other Strictly singers don\'t get to choose the songs that they are going to perform. That decision is made by the professional dancers.  "I prefer jazz standards and perhaps a nice old Temptations song," she said.  "Some pop numbers are difficult to recreate vocally, and Queen numbers can be quite scary.  "Then if I have to do an \'80s rock ballad, I have to scream and go for it which is quite a challenge."  Surprisingly, the first time the orchestra get together to rehearse is at 10am on the morning of the live television show.  "It\'s a very long day and it takes it out of you and the dancers," said Hayley.

Lord Shiva portrayed with Sanskrit manuscripts of Hindu scriptures.\xa0 ExoticIndia.com  By Subhamoy Das  Updated August 02, 2015.  Arguably the world’s oldest extant language, Sanskrit is an ancient and classical language of India in which the Hindu scripture Rig Veda , regarded as the first ever book compiled by human beings, was written. In the words of the Indian scholar Sri Aurobindo , “Sanskrit language, as has been universally recognized by those competent to form a judgment, is one of the most magnificent, the most perfect, the most prominent and wonderfully sufficient literary instrument developed by the human mind.”  When Did Sanskrit Originate?  According to the Indian tradition, Sanskrit has no beginning or end. It is self-born, divine, eternal and everlasting. The Sanskrit language is believed to have evolved to its expressive capability prior to the composition of the Vedas, which can be dated back to 6500 - 1500 BC.\xa0 During this period a vast body of literary work including the Vedas , Brahmana-Granthas, Aranyakas, Upanishads and Vedangas, known as Vedic literature came to be written in 'Vedic Sanskrit,' an ancient form of present-day Sanskrit.  Each Veda had its book of grammar known as 'Pratishakhya.' \xa0The Pratishakhyas explained the forms of the words and other grammatical points, which gave rise to various schools of grammar.\xa0  The Development of Sanskrit Grammar  The ancient Hindu sage Panini , who lived around 500 BC, made a great stride in the development of Sanskrit language.\xa0 He, combining about ten grammar schools prevalent during his time, wrote the master book of grammar named Ashtadhyayi, which served as a beacon for the later period. Literary Sanskrit and spoken Sanskrit both followed Panini’s system of language.\xa0 Today, the correctness of Sanskrit language is still tested upon the touchstone of Panini’s Ashtadhyayi. Sanskrit is so scientific that experts find it the fittest language for computerization. It is precise and unambiguous and is accepted the world over as an ideal language for modern information technology.  The Family Tree of Sanskrit Language  Sanskrit is said to belong to the Indo-Aryan or Indo Germanic family of languages which includes Greek, and Latin.\xa0 The Anglo-Welsh Indologist William Jones , who was also a Greek and Latin scholar opined that Sanskrit is better than Greek or Latin .\xa0 He said, “The language of Sanskrit is of a wonderful structure, more perfect than Greek, more copious than Latin and more exquisitely refined than either.”\xa0  According to the German Orientalist Max Muller , “Sanskrit is the greatest language of the world.” And as such it can be regarded as “the mother of Europe’s languages,” as Will Durant put it. Such eulogy for this language is common: “Sanskrit is the unsurpassed zenith in the whole development of languages yet known to us” (Wilhelm von Humboldt) and the “intellectual debt of Europe to Sanskrit literature has been undeniably great.” (Prof. Macdonell).  Sanskrit, the Mother of Indian Languages  Sanskrit has been the source of later Indian languages and literature, especially Pali and Prakrit .\xa0 Pali was taken as means for exposition of Buddhist ideas and Prakrit was used for the spread of Jain doctrines.\xa0 Most of the Buddhist and Jain literature were written in these two languages as well as in Sanskrit.\xa0  Modern Indian languages used in Northern India, including the country’s official language Hindi, have evolved from Sanskrit. Other Indian languages of South India - Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu have evolved from the Dravidian family of languages, which have also been well enriched and nourished by Sanskrit.  Is the Sanskrit Language Dead?

As an adolescent she attended a Catholic seminary for girls in Virginia, but at sixteen she married John Surratt, at least ten years her senior, and in 1840 settled with him in Prince George’s County, Maryland. In the early years of their marriage the Surratts prospered as a result of John’s success as a planter, which allowed him to expand his land holdings and open a general store and tavern, making up the core of the community that came to be known as Surrattsville (now Clinton). In 1854, a post office was even established in town, with John as its first postmaster. John’s earlier achievements were undermined, however, by his excessive drinking, which led to neglect of his farm and crops and a steady decline in his fortunes. In August 1862, John died. The Surratts’ eldest son Isaac (b. 1841), having taken a job as a pony-express rider in Mexico, left Mary Surratt alone to care for her two younger children, Anna (b. 1843) and John, Jr. (b. 1844).  Surratt struggled to manage what remained of the family’s holdings in Surrattsville, but she found it increasingly difficult, not least of all because John, Jr. showed so little interest in helping on the farm. By fall 1864, Mary Surratt had moved with John, Jr. and Anna to a house on H Street in Washington, D.C., which her husband had purchased in 1853 and which she converted into a boardinghouse. Happily for the Surratts, the boardinghouse did quite well, with a small number of steady boarders and the constant flow of more transient traffic through the federal capital during the war.  As early as 1863, John Surratt, Jr. – a loyal Southerner like his late father – began serving the Confederacy as a courier. In connection with this work, and with his college studies, John brought a number of people home to H Street, some of whom would later become entangled in the assassination conspiracy. In the spring of 1863, John introduced his mother to a school chum named Louis Weichmann, who took up residence in the Surratt boardinghouse in November 1864. By January 1865, John had met and become good friends with the ardent secessionist and actor John Wilkes Booth. Subsequently Booth was a regular visitor to H Street as well. German immigrant and assassination co-conspirator George Atzerodt also stayed at the boardinghouse for a few days in February 1865, until Mary Surratt evicted him for excessive drinking. Posting as a Baptist preacher, Lewis Powell – later found guilty of the 14 April attack on Secretary of State William H. Seward – lodged at the Surratt boardinghouse for three days in March.  Surratt Tavern in Clinton, Maryland (formerly Surrattsville)  It was not long after the shooting at Ford’s Theater that government investigators first descended on the boardinghouse. At approximately 2:30 on the morning of 15 April, several officials arrived and demanded to search the house in connection with the murder of the President. It appears that these men were looking for John, Jr., whom they believed at the time to have been the one to assault Seward. On the evening of the 17th, two detectives and two army officers returned, this time to arrest Mary Surratt and the rest of the people remaining in the house (Weichmann had slipped out on the 15th and was arrested that day; other boarders, disturbed by the crowds gathering around the house, had moved out on the 16th). Of the five who were arrested, all were women, with the exception of Lewis Powell, who arrived in disguise at the last, and for him most inopportune, moment. John Surratt, Jr., was nowhere to be found, and Booth had already escaped across the Potomac.

A:  Quick Answer  According to English-for-Students.com, New Orleans\' nickname "The Big Easy" refers to its laid-back attitude and the easy-going nature of the jazz musicians and other residents of the city. The name came into common use after the release of James Conaways\' novel entitled "The Big Easy" in 1970, but its exact origins remain unclear.  Full Answer  English-For-Students.com explains that Conaways likely picked up the nickname "The Big Easy" from slang what was already being used in the New Orleans area. Some also report the existence of a jazz club called "The Big Easy" in the early 1900s, and it\'s possible that the nickname evolved from that of the club. However, there is no evidence to prove that this club existed.  There are said to be ties between the nickname "The Big Easy" and New York City\'s nickname, "The Big Apple," with some claiming that New Orleans\' nickname was coined in order to contrast the city with the more energetic New York. Nutrias.org states that in the 1970s, a local gossip columnist wrote an article contrasting New York and New Orleans, and used the term "The Big Easy" as a metaphor for the laid back lifestyle to be had in the latter city. The nickname became more commonplace in the years that followed.

Nicknames can help establish the identity of a city. They can also spread pride among its citizens.  New Orleans, Louisiana probably has more nicknames than any other American city. One web site lists more than twenty nicknames. The most famous is “The Big Easy.” It describes the gentle, slow and easy-going way of life in New Orleans.  Bourbon Street in New Orleans  So how did the city get this nickname? In the early 1900s there was a dance hall in New Orleans called “The Big Easy.” But the nickname did not become famous until the early 1970s. That was when a Louisiana newspaper writer began calling New Orleans by this name. She compared the easy-going way of life there to the hurried pace of life in New York City.  In 1970, James Conaway wrote a crime novel called “The Big Easy.” The story was set in New Orleans. In 1987, that book was made into a film which made the nickname even more popular.  New Orleans has other nicknames. One of them is “The Crescent City.” During the 19th century, new neighborhoods expanded out from what is now known as the French Quarter. These areas followed the great curve of the Mississippi River, giving New Orleans the shape of a crescent.  Port of New Orleans  Another nickname is “The Birthplace of Jazz,” because that kind of music started in New Orleans. It is also called “Mardi Gras City” for the wild celebrations and parades that take place there every year. And, there is a nickname that uses the short way to write New Orleans and Louisiana. It you do not want to use the complete name, you can call the city “NOLA.”  One of America’s most exciting cities is Las Vegas, Nevada. There you can play games of chance all night long.

The battle actually took place near the village of Branxton in the county of Northumberland , rather than at Flodden - hence the alternative name of Battle of Branxton.  The Scots had previously been stationed at Flodden, near to Branxton. (This was to be the last battle to take place in Northumberland.)  The battle was the climax of days of manoeuvring, with the Scottish schiltrons relinquishing the defensive high ground in order to come to grips with the English, whose billmen wielded a devastating weapon that was more than a match for the Scottish spears that had changed little since Bannockburn .  In the bloody slogging match that characterised such warfare, the Scots were eventually encircled and cut to pieces.  The Scottish reserve led by the Duke of Argyll , Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll (c.1507-1558), who was to pay for this inaction with his head many years later, watched impassively as King James and his army was destroyed.  The king, many of his nobles, and over 10,000 men were all killed.  Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Surrey, was Lieutenant General and largely responsible for the Tudor victory for Henry VIII of England . He subsequently was restored to his father's title of Duke of Norfolk.  Skirmishes over the English - Scottish border had been taking place for centuries, and was perhaps the longest such 'war' on record.  On this occasion, King James had proclaimed war with England to honour the Auld Alliance , namely, to divert Henry VIII 's English troops from their campaign against the French king Louis XII ; England was involved in a larger conflict, defending Italy and the Pope from the French, see Italian Wars , as a member of the Catholic League .

"An adult human brain has more than 100 billion neurons"  >\xa0100 billion  One of the most remarkable aspects of the adult nervous system is the human brain. The human brain controls memory, vision, learning, thought, consciousness and other activities. By means of electrochemical impulses the brain directly controls conscious or voluntary behavior. It also monitors, through feedback circuitry, most involuntary behavior and influences automatic activities of the internal organs.  During fetal development the foundations of the mind are laid as billions of neurons form appropriate connections and patterns. No aspect of this complicated structure has been left to chance. The basic wiring plan is encoded in the genes. It has been shown from previous studies that in developing embryos of animals, nerve cells are created in or travel to designated regions of the brain, and once in place send out axons along preprogrammed paths to make contact with specific targets.  The brain\'s billions of neurons connect with one another in complex networks. All physical and mental functioning depends on the establishment and maintenance of neuron networks. A person\'s habits and skills -- such as nail-biting or playing a musical instrument -- become embedded within the brain in frequently activated neuron networks. When a person stops performing an activity, the neural networks for the activity fall into disuse and eventually may disappear.  Differences in weight and size of a person\'s brain does not correlate with differences in mental ability. The adult human brain normally weighs from 1.0 to 1.5\xa0kg (2¼ to 3¼\xa0lbs).  The work of the brain is similar to a combination of a computer and a chemical factory. So take good care of your PC!

Search the site  By Kendra Cherry - Reviewed by a board-certified physician.  Updated March 11, 2016  How many neurons are in the human brain? Older estimates have long suggested that 100 billion was the magic number, but some more recent research suggests that the brain actually contains fewer neurons than previously believed.  The human brain is made up of a complex network of neurons . These neurons serve as the building blocks of the nervous system, transmitting information to and from the brain and throughout the body.  You probably expect that a large number of neurons are required for such a complex process, but just how many neurons are there in the human brain?  How Many Neurons are in the Human Brain?  According to many estimates, the human brain contains around 100 billion neurons (give or take a few billion). This estimate has often been reported for many years in neuroscience and psychology textbooks and for many years was simply accepted as a relatively close approximation.  Recently, however, Brazilian researcher Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel discovered that these estimates might not be entirely accurate. While the number is widely cited, she found that no one seemed to know where this number originated. She then decided to investigate in order to determine if the number is accurate. | Question: The human brain is made up of between 10 billion and 100 billion nerve cells known as what?', ['nerve cells', 'neuron', 'neurons'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1877'), ('Context: Sherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths | Books | The GuardianSherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths | Books | The Guardian  Arthur Conan Doyle  Sherlock Holmes: dispelling the myths  We think we know all about Conan Doyle\'s immortal detective, with his pipes, dressing-gown and cocaine – but do we really, asks Sam Leith  Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series. Photograph: Robert Viglasky/PA  Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  First published on Saturday 11 October 2014 02.00\xa0EDT  Share on Messenger  Close  Sometime in 1885 or 1886, Arthur Conan Doyle was doodling on a sheet of paper. He had the idea – inspired by Auguste Dupin, the sleuth who had solved Edgar Allan Poe \'s "The Murders in the Rue Morgue " – for a "consulting detective", who would use "the Rules of Evidence" to\xa0catch his man. But what would he be\xa0called? "Ormond Sacker"? "Sherrinford Holmes"?  Had he settled on either of these alternatives, the modern-day fanclubs for the great-grandfather of gumshoes might now style themselves "Sherrinfordians", "Sackerians" or "Ormondians". Instead, they are "Sherlockians" in the US and "Holmesians" in the UK, and, at a exhibition opening at the Museum of London on Friday, they will be able to peer through their magnifying glasses at that historic piece of paper.  Sherlock Holmes: The Man Who Never Lived And Will Never Die is the first major show dedicated to the great detective since a Holmes display graced the Festival of Britain in 1951. It\'s a\xa0winningly daft title: there are an\xa0infinite number of men who never lived and will never die, and a very large number of fictional creations of whom the same could also be said. But you can see what they are getting at.  It is apt that the show should take place at the Museum of London. Holmes occupied perhaps London\'s most famous imaginary address – 221B Baker Street – and Dr Watson wrote that his "knowledge of the byways of London was extraordinary". In the form of his "Baker Street Irregulars", he even employed a street-level spy-network of\xa0urchins. London is often described as another character in the\xa0stories.  But, as historian David Cannadine points out in a fine, sceptical essay in a\xa0new book accompanying the exhibition, Holmes\'s London is actually only\xa0sketchily imagined in the stories. Conan Doyle grew up in Edinburgh, was educated in Lancashire and Austria, and lived in central London for less than a year before moving first to South Norwood, then in\xa0short order to\xa0Hindhead in Surrey and later to Sussex. To move Holmes around the capital, Conan Doyle used contemporary street atlases and the London Post Office Directory – the closest thing to Google Maps at the time. And he made all sorts of mistakes.  It\'s true that when we think of Holmes – as well as\xa0funny hats, dressing-gowns, pipes, violins, scary dogs and "a 7% solution of cocaine" – we think of gaslight and gloaming, tendrils of fog, the impatient rap of\xa0cane on cobblestones, horses whinnying and hansoms clattering. But this is as much due to Basil Rathbone \'s set-dressers and the prose of Charles Dickens as to\xa0the prose of Conan Doyle. But that is the genius of the stories. And it\xa0isn\'t just with respect to London that Conan Doyle\'s creation proved porous to the imaginations of others.  That sort of porosity is the defining characteristic of myth – and Holmes did indeed almost instantly become a\xa0myth. He escaped the confines of his stories, just as he escaped his exasperated creator\'s attempt to kill him off. Indeed, many of his best known appurtenances are completely absent from those stories. As any fule kno, he\xa0never said "Elementary, my dear Watson". The magnifying glass is Conan Doyle\'s, but the deerstalker hat was a creation of the Strand magazine\'s illustrator Sidney Paget .

One of those men would be hailed as the inventor of the Frisbee. The other would die unknown, just as he began to fight for a share of the credit and millions in royalties the Frisbee generated. The First to Fly Walter Frederick Morrison came to Warren Franscioni in 1947, looking for work. Both men had been Army Air Corps pilots in World War II. Maj. Franscioni served with the Air Transport Service in India and China; Lt. Morrison flew a fighter in 58 missions over Italy before being shot down and held in Stalag 13, Germany\'s infamous prison camp. Franscioni\'s parents lived in Paso Robles, where his father had been mayor, so he settled after the war in San Luis Obispo. He founded a butane company as his father had done in Paso. He built a home on Conejo Avenue, in a neighborhood developing near San Luis High School, and he opened the Franscioni and Davis Butane Co. office at 884 Broad St., across Broad from Mission College Prep. "I first met Fred Morrison in late 1947," Franscioni wrote in a 1973 letter. "He was a struggling World War II veteran trying to build a home for his family at Baywood Park, a developing residential area just outside San Luis Obispo, California. "At that time, I was attempting to establish a bottle gas business with a partner, George Davis, in San Luis Obispo. We needed someone to assist in the installation of home heating appliances, and Fred went to work for us." The bottled gas business moved too slowly in postwar SLO to sustain three men and their families. So Franscioni and Morrison dreamed up an enterprise on the side. For decades kids had played catch with metal pie tins. The sport grew in popularity during the Depression, and soldiers spread it across the country during the war. The game had a few drawbacks. The tins made a shrill noise, and if you didn\'t catch them just right, they stung. After a few crash landings they could crack or develop sharp edges that cut fingers. Morrison and Franscioni thought of casting them in plastic, a material proliferated by wartime industry. Morrison took credit for the idea in later interviews, but Franscioni said they thought of it together. "I do know that when we compared some of our past experiences at sailing things, it came out plastics," Franscioni wrote.   It seems like a simple idea today, but Morrison and Franscioni broke new ground. And after 49 years of improvements, the Frisbee has diverged little from their first plastic interpretation of a pie tin. "People were throwing paint can lids and paper plates and pie pans throughout history, since they were invented," said Victor Malafronte, a Frisbee historian in Alameda. "The first plastic disc was that Flyin\' Saucer in 1948." Morrison and Franscioni used a lathe to carve their first model out of Tenite, a hard cellulose material now used in toothbrush handles and eyeglass frames. That disc confirmed the aerodynamics of the toy, but it shattered on landing.

Over the centuries, a geocentric view of the universe — with Earth at the center of everything — gave way to the proper understanding we have today of an expanding universe in which our galaxy is but one of billions. On this list are some of the most famous scientists from the early days of astronomy through the modern era, and a summary of some of their achievements.  Any list of famous astronomers has to include a varied collection of great scientists from the Greeks to the modern era, big thinkers who tackled many fields as well as modern astronomers who made significant discoveries and helped popularize astronomy.

Credit: Bartolomeu Velho, Public Domain  When most people believed the world was flat, the notable Greek mathematician, astronomer and geographer Eratosthenes (276 BCE- 195 BCE) used the sun to measure the size of the round Earth. His measurement of 24,660 miles (39,690 kilometers) was only 211 miles (340 km) off the true measurement.  The ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (AD 90- 168) set up a model of the solar system in which the sun, stars, and other planets revolved around Earth. Known as the Ptolemaic system, it remained in place for hundreds of years, though it turned out to be flat wrong.  Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986), known as Azophi to Westerners, made the first known observation of a group of stars outside of the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy.  Nicolaus Copernicus  Credit: Public Domain  In 16th century Poland, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a model of the solar system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. The model wasn't completely correct, as astronomers of the time struggled with the backwards path Mars sometimes took, but it eventually changed the way many scientists viewed the solar system.  Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles but in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today.  Galileo Galilei is credited with discovering the first four moons of Jupiter.  Credit: NASA  Born in Italy, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is often credited with the creation of the optical telescope, though in truth he improved on existing models. The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) turned the new observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons), as well as the rings of Saturn. Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. Galileo is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.  Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomena that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the first observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its moon, Titan.  Building on the work of those who had gone before him, English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites.

Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of "formal" and "informal" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or "full-fledged colonial rule" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully. | Question: A forced trade agreement between two countries would be an example of what?', ['informal" imperialism', 'imperialism', 'Informal rule', '"informal" imperialism'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-9807'), ('Context: American car manufacturers Nash ( in 1949 ) and Ford ( in 1955 ) offered seat belts as options , while Swedish Saab first introduced seat belts as standard in 1958 .

It is the  UK's highest award for bravery by a civilian or a military person where  the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) is not  applicable. In order of precedence, the George Cross is second only to  the Victoria Cross . As no person has won both  awards, they can be considered as equals. Since its introduction, the  George Cross can be awarded posthumously.  The Seagrim family has won both the Victoria  Cross and George Cross; a different brother winning each of the medals.  The George  Cross has been awarded twice to a group of people, as distinct from an  individual: The Island of Malta in 1942 and the Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC) in November 1999.  History  of the George Cross  When, in  1940, King George VI instituted the George Cross and George Medal the  total nature of World War Two had brought war into all civilian life,  and there were many acts of outstanding gallantry for which the terms  of award of the existing non-military medals were deemed to be inappropriate.  Initially only the George Cross could be issued posthumously, but following  a new warrant in 1978, the George Medal can be now be issued posthumously.  When the  George Cross was introduced, it superseded the Empire  Gallantry Medal (EGM) whose living recipients were required to exchange  their EGM for the George Cross.  Following  an amended warrant in December 1971, surviving recipients of the Albert  Medal (AM) and Edward Medal (EM) exchanged  their medal for the George Cross.  During World  War Two (1939-45) there were instances when it was not easy to decide  whether a Victoria Cross or a George Cross was the more proper award.  The George Cross was intended to be an award for outstanding civilian  bravery, but as many people in the armed forces were unavoidably engaged  in work not appropriate for strictly military awards, they became eligible  for the George Cross equally with civilians. Consequently, 76 of the first  100 awards were made to members of the armed forces. A complete tally  of the 152 direct awards of the George Cross up to 1985 shows that only  49 have gone to civilians.

May 7th 2016  Nearly everyone has some kind of fear, and some fears are more common than others. Sometimes these fears are rooted in actual experiences and other times they are not. Even having multiple phobias is quite common. These are just some of the most common phobias, but there are much more that have been documented.  1. Arachnophobia  Arachnophobia is the fear of spiders. Many people who share this fear are typically affected by a childhood memory, or are just frightened by the appearance. Even the thought of one crawling on their skin can make them shudder in fear. In the dark ages, spiders were thought to harbor the bubonic plague and were seen as a source of food and water contamination, leading to a widespread fear of spiders.  2. Ophidiophobia  Ophidiophobia is a fear of snakes. Some experts believe that the fear of snakes may be an innate survival mechanism to protect people from poisonous reptiles, though others argue that if this was the case, this phobia wouldn\'t be as common as it is. This phobia can cause people to avoid places like zoos or pet stores.  3. Acrophobia  Acrophobia is a fear of heights. Unlike a lot of fears, this fear can manifest into other fears, such as a fear of flying or roller coasters. This fear can vary in severity as well. Some may avoid things like climbing ladders, while others may not be able to ride in an elevator or go to a high floor in a building.  4. Necrophobia  Necrophobia is the fear of death or dead things. This is a very common fear, especially after the loss of a loved one. This fear is a sort of defense mechanism of the mind. This can also be a very difficult phobia to overcome because of the uncertainty surrounding death and the large faith component associated with death and dying.  5. Cynophobia  Cynophobia is the fear of dogs, and is often the result of a traumatic experience. For example, someone bitten by a dog as an infant may have a fear of dogs into adulthood without knowing why. This phobia can cause people to avoid dog-owning friends or relatives.  6. Claustrophobia  Most people know that claustrophobia is the fear of confined spaces. This fear can manifest after a traumatic experience, such as being stuck in an elevator, though this is not always the case. Claustrophobia can vary in severity and is known to run in families.  7. Coulrophobia  Coulrophobia is the fear of clowns. Many people develop this fear as children, though this isn\'t always the case. Clowns are often portrayed in media as bad, such as in the move "It", or in real life as was the case with serial killer John Wayne Gacy who dressed up like a clown. This can trigger a phobia in some people.  8. Pediophobia  This is the phobia of dolls. Dolls were originally created as vessels for the dead, and this seems to be the root of many fears, particularly that the dolls could cause harm to the person with the phobia. One high profile case of pediophobia is that of Zak Bagans from the television show "Ghost Adventures." Bagans\' phobia is so intense that he cannon touch a doll or toy clown.  9. Hemophobia  This is the fear of blood. Some people experience feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness and occasionally faint at the sight of blood, even when it is something as small as a cut. The origins of this fear are unclear, but it may be related to a fear of death.  10. Glossaphobia  This is one phobia that many people struggle to overcome. Glossaphobia is the fear of public speaking. This phobia can manifest in childhood, and it\'s estimated that up to 75 percent of people have this fear to some degree.  11. Nyctophobia  This is one of the most common childhood fears, the fear of the darkness.

The primary damage mechanism of these fictional weapons is usually thermal transfer; it typically causes serious burns, and often immediate death of living creatures, and melts or evaporates other materials.  In certain fiction, plasma weapons may also have a significant kinetic energy component, that is to say the ionized material is projected with sufficient momentum to cause some secondary impact damage in addition to causing high thermal damage.  In some fictions, like Star Wars, plasma is highly effective against mechanical targets such as droids.  The ionized gas disrupts their systems.   Plasma (physics)  Plasma (from Ancient Greek πλάσμα , meaning "moldable substance" or "jelly") can simply be considered as a gaseous mixture of negatively charged electrons and highly charged positive ions, however, true plasma production is from the distinct separation of these ions and electrons that produces an electric field, which in turn, produces electric currents and magnetic fields. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter and was first introduced by chemist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s.

However, most women entering these such laundries were in fact unmarried mothers and in many cases these women were forced into such institutions by the powers of the Church and even family members who did not want to live with the \'shame\' of having a woman in their home with a baby born outside of wedlock. Many of these "laundries" were effectively operated as penitentiary work-houses. The strict regimes in the institutions were often more severe than those found in the prisons, this contradicted the perceived outlook that they were meant to treat the women as opposed to punishing them. Controversially the men in society were never victimised for committing the same crime, of having an illegitimate child, they essentially got off scot-free. [1] Laundries such as this operated throughout Europe and North America for much of the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century, the last one closing in 1996. The institutions were named after the Biblical figure Mary Magdalene , in earlier centuries characterised as a reformed prostitute.  Contents  Inception[ edit ]  The first Magdalene institution was founded in late 1758 in Whitechapel , England, [2] which led to the establishment of a similar institution in Ireland by 1767. [2] The first Magdalene asylum in the United States was the Magdalen Society of Philadelphia , founded in 1800; other North American cities, including New York, Boston, Chicago, and Toronto, quickly followed suit. [3] [4] In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Magdalene asylums were common in several countries. [3] By 1900, there were more than 300 asylums in England and more than 20 in Scotland. [2] [5]  Magdalene laundries by country[ edit ]  Australia[ edit ]  From the early 1890s to the 1960s, most Australian state capitals had a large convent which contained a commercial laundry where the work was done by mostly teenage girls who were placed in the convent, voluntarily or involuntarily, for reasons such as being destitute, uncontrollable, or picked up by the police. [6] According to James Franklin, the girls came from a variety of very disturbed and deprived backgrounds and were individually hard to deal with in many cases. [7]  Laundry work was regarded as suitable as it did not require much training nor substantial capital expense. Memories of conditions in the convent laundries by former inmates are consistently negative, detailing verbal abuse and very hard work. In accordance with the traditions of the nuns, much of the day proceeded in silence. [8] Like orphanages, they received almost no government funds. As in any underfunded institution, the food was described as bland. The nuns shared the conditions of the inmates, such as the bad food, hard work, the confinement and the long periods of silence. Education for residents was either of poor quality or lacking altogether. There was no physical contact on the part of the sisters, and no emotional contact in the sense of listening to the girls’ own concerns.  Dangers included diseases and workplace accidents.

Evidence has been dug up that this root plant originated in Afghanistan. Over the centuries traders traveling through the region picked up carrot seeds there and carried them along the trade routes of Arabia, Africa, and Asia, selling them in regions anxious to cultivate new and productive plants. Even in the early days there were many varieties of carrots, coming in an assortment of colors - purple, white, black, and red but, surprisingly, not orange!  Carrots spread over the civilized world and have even been found in Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh\'s tombs. Drawings found in Egyptian temples are thought by Egyptologists to be a purple variety of carrots 1 .  Both the ancient Greeks and the Romans were familiar with carrots, although these early varieties were not the sweet, succulent orange carrots that are grown today. Early carrots were typically not often eaten as food by the Greeks, but were used for medicinal purposes. The Romans were known to have eaten both raw and cooked carrots accompanied with an olive oil dressing containing different herbs. Like many other plants, at various times in ancient societies, carrots were thought to be an aphrodisiac.  Carrots began to be cultivated in Europe by the 13th century (1200s), with many doctors prescribing carrots for medicinal purposes for ailments as varied as syphilis and animal bites! The Medieval Europeans were very much in awe of the ancients and inclined to borrow heavily from them.  Carrots were well-known to 16th century botanists and writers, who described red and purple varieties in France, and yellow and red varieties in England. The Dutch cross-bred the yellow and red carrot to produce a variety that was the emblematic color of the House of Orange. This carrot quickly became popular and was further developed to become the sweet, succulent orange carrot which is the most recognized color of carrot used throughout the world today 2 .  Carrots arrived in Australia in 1788 and became an important food for the colonists. The Carrot Museum reveals that the carrot was introduced to America in 1609. In 1871 America developed its first carrot. It is called the Danvers carrot from its origins in Danvers, MA. However, the carrot did not become popular in the U.S. until after World War I (1914-1918) when "doughboys" returning from the war had been exposed to the carrot in French and other European cuisine. 3  In the Second World War carrots were promoted by the British government and became one of the staple foods in England. People were encouraged grow carrots in their gardens and to cook them in different ways. They were incorporated into both sweet and savory dishes. Growing this crop during troubled times helped people get sufficient amounts of nutritious food to eat in times of food scarcity and rationing.  Red and yellow varieties of carrot are eaten in China and Japan; with the purple carrot becoming increasingly popular in different states in America. There are also \'rainbow\' carrots on the market. However, a single carrot is not multi-colored, the name comes from bags containing red, yellow, purple and orange carrots.  History of Carrots - A brief summary and timelineOrange and red  Sources - Rubatzsky and Banga. Also Carrot Museum\'s Curator      research material Reference material is here.  Notes: Red was often confused with purple.\xa0 Orange      carrots may have been around well before 1100 - see here . The above listing is a "best guess" as there is much conflicting evidence.  Carrots were also probably White throughout these periods,      often confused with Parsnips (also white).      There was (and still is!) enormous confusion when trying to sort out the individual histories of carrots and parsnips. The Latin name      for the parsnip genus is      thought to come from,      meaning "food". This would further explain the historical confusion of the      two vegetables, as well as offer a testament to how important they both were in      the ancient diet.

This defeat was short-lived as Evander Holyfield regained his championship title in a rematch with Riddick Bowe in 1993. In 1996, Evander Holyfield joined Muhammad Ali, in the history books as the second man to become the three-time world heavyweight champion. He accomplished this remarkable achievement by defeating Mike Tyson and continued to hold that title after defeating him in a rematch.

When he was 19 years old, Holyfield represented the U.S. in the Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, where he won a silver medal. The following year, he was the National Golden Gloves Champion, and won a bronze medal representing the U.S. in the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles.  Holyfield made his professional debut in November, 1984 defeating Lionel Bryams. He won his first Cruiserweight title in 1986 against Dwight M. Qwai (then WBA Junior Heavyweight), and became the first boxer of the 1984 Olympic Games to win a championship title.  Over the next three years, Holyfield earned his place in the history books, by becoming the only boxer ever to become an undefeated, undisputed Cruiserweight Champion. Even today, all Cruiserweight championship belts bear his likeness as a lasting tribute to his legacy.  Carrying his championship drive to all facets of life, Evander Holyfield has created the Holyfield Foundation, a not-for-profit organization whose focus is on the family. The charity’s primary objective is to provide a supportive, safe environment for inner city youth to grow spiritually, educationally and athletically.

Louise Brough  1948-1950, 1955  No player has ever dominated Wimbledon more completely than did Brough in the three Championships between 1948 and 1950. Not only did she collect three of her four singles titles in that time, but she reached the final of every event, winning eight out of nine. The only final she lost was the mixed doubles in the middle year, when she played 117 games in three finals that involved five hours 20 minutes\' playing time on Centre Court on the final Saturday of the tournament. Her hard volleying was ideally suited to the Wimbledon grass courts, which she again demonstrated in adding a last singles victory in 1955. It was her 13th title in total at the All England Club and she did not drop a set in winning it. With Margaret du Pont, she also collected a remarkable 12 women\'s doubles successes in the US Championships.  Maria Bueno  1959-1960, 1964  The lithe and elegant Brazilian brought sex appeal to the Wimbledon lawns, improving the SW19 libido. All the men in the Centre Court crowd fell in love with Bueno after she won her first Wimbledon title in 1959, after which she was given a prize of a clothes voucher and then flown back in a presidential jet to a ticker-tape parade in Sao Paolo. In future years she titillated Wimbledon by wearing a white dress with a pink lining, and also won two more titles, in 1960 and 1964.  Maureen Connolly  1952-1954  Her first love was horse riding, but Maureen Connolly\'s mother could not afford the lessons and she turned to tennis. \'Little Mo\' snaffled a hat-trick of Wimbledon titles, from 1952-54, and was a popular figure back home in the United States. But that did not stop her from speaking of "the dark destiny" of her tennis career. "I always believed greatness on a tennis court was my destiny, a dark destiny at times, where the court became my secret jungle and I, a lonely, fear-stricken hunter. I was a strange little girl armed with hate, fear and a golden racket," Connolly once said.  Margaret Court  1963, 1965, 1970  \'Big Marge\' dominated the tour in the 1960s and 1970s, winning her first two Wimbledon titles, as Margaret Smith, in 1963 and 1965. She quit the circuit in 1966 to marry and start a family, but returned to the game as Margaret Court, and in 1970 won all four majors to achieve the grand slam. On the Wimbledon leg of that feat, Court and the American Billie Jean King contested what was one of the greatest finals in the tournament\'s history, with the Australian eventually closing out a 14-12, 11-9 victory. In addition to her three Wimbledon trophies, Court won a further 21 grand slam singles titles, taking her singles tally to 24, and many consider her to be the greatest female player to have ever stepped on Centre Court.  Lindsay Davenport  1999  American Lindsay Davenport may have won Wimbledon as well as the US and Australian Opens , plus an Olympic gold medal, in an illustrious career.

Today, it is home to the French Senate; the Palace is open for group tours when the Sentate is not in session.  Also included on the grounds, and until recently under the supervision of the Senate, is the Musée du Luxembourg, France's first public museum. The works originally shown there have since been moved to the Louvre, and today it shows important exhibitions by classic and contemporary artists.

Palais du Luxembourg History  Marie de’ Medici acquired in 1611\xa0 the François de Luxembourg Mansion on                 Rue de Vaugirard together with its large grounds outside the town walls, neighbouring a Carthusian                 convent.  By October 1611 she was planning to have a new residence built on the site and                 asked her aunt, the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, for the ground-plan and elevations of the Palazzo                 Pitti in Florence to serve for the structure of the new palace.  After she sent Louis Métezeau to Florence, Salomon de Brosse, whom she had                 already employed to complete her château at Monceaux-en-Brie, won a competition to become the                 architect.  Some additional land having been acquired, the first stone of the new palace was                 laid in April 1615; the new building was erected close beside the older Luxembourg Mansion, which                 became known as the petit Luxembourg.  The ground-plan of the Palais du Luxembourg was laid out like                 that of a suburban château and was reminiscent not so much of the Palazzo Pitti as of the châteaux of Verneuil or Coulommiers: it had a quadrilateral layout around a rectangular courtyard with the main                    building and a central staircase at the bottom of the courtyard, large pavilions built out from                    the corners and a terraced portico and a domed entry on the street.  The elevation, on the other hand, did recall the Palazzo Pitti.  Even before the east wing and the entrance were completed, Marie de’ Medici                 commissioned Rubens to execute a number of canvases to decorate the two matching galleries that                 were to counterpoint one another on either side of the courtyard.  Rubens executed the first suite of paintings, devoted to the Life of Marie de’ Medici, but produced only a few sketches for the works intended for the second gallery, which were                 to be devoted to the Life of Henry IV. Work on decoration was interrupted by the Queen’s exile to                 Brussels in 1630.  In 1646 the Palais du Luxembourg fell into the ownership of                 Gaston d’Orléans, who had apparently been living there since 1643.  It was then occupied by various members of the Orléans family; the words Palais                 d’Orléans could be read on a marble plaque over the door until the Revolution. In 1799 the palace                 was assigned to the Senate.  The arcades of the porticos were closed down and the central staircase was                 demolished so that the Senate chamber was placed in its place.

To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of "formal" and "informal" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or "full-fledged colonial rule" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully. | Question: A forced trade agreement between two countries would be an example of what?', ['informal" imperialism', 'imperialism', 'Informal rule', '"informal" imperialism'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-9807'), ("Context: Blaze ( voiced by Nolan North ) is an orange - red monster truck who is good hearted , loyal and brave .

Fulham suffered an inconsistent start to the season , with results such as a 4 -- 0 against local rivals QPR countered by results like a 0 -- 3 home loss to Wolves . After a 2 -- 5 loss at home to Birmingham City , and lying in 12th place , Kit Symons was sacked as Fulham manager in November 2015 . It took 49 days to find a replacement , the club using Peter Grant and Stuart Gray in the interim , before appointing the Serbian Slaviša Jokanović on 27 December 2015 . Fulham 's fortunes did not improve greatly following Jokanović 's appointment , with no league wins until their 3 -- 1 victory over QPR on 13 February 2016 . This poor run of form brought Fulham down to 18th position in the Championship . Aside from a further victory against Charlton Athletic on 20 February 2016 , the club again went winless until their 2 -- 1 victory over relegation strugglers MK Dons , on 2 April 2016 . Fulham finished the 2015 / 16 Championship season in 20th place , avoiding relegation by 11 points . After yet another squad overhaul , the following season saw huge improvements in both results and performances . After a good start , which included a 1 - 0 win over newly - relegated Newcastle , Fulham found themselves in 2nd place at the end of August . A poor September followed , but a significant improvement from October onwards , which included the 5 - 0 thrashings of high - flying Huddersfield Town and Reading , got Fulham back into play - off contention . Fulham secured a 6th place finish after an impressive finish to the season , which saw Fulham collect 37 points out of their last 17 games , and entered the play - offs , where they were undone by a controversial Yann Kermorgant penalty , which saw Reading triumph 2 - 1 on aggregate . After a poor first half of the 2017 / 18 season , which included a 1 - 0 loss away to bottom placed Sunderland on 16 December 2017 , Fulham struggled to break the top half of the table . Following that loss at Sunderland , Fulham went on a club - record 23 game unbeaten run in the league , which included a 6 - 0 romping of Burton Albion and wins against fellow promotion rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers , Aston Villa and Cardiff City . The run ended on the final day of the season , as Fulham fell to a 3 - 1 defeat against Birmingham City . Had Fulham won , they would have finished the season in second place , as Cardiff failed to beat Reading . Instead they would have to face the play - offs for a second season running . After overcoming a 1 - 0 away defeat to Derby County in the semi finals , Fulham won the EFL Championship play - off Final against Aston Villa to return to the Premier League on 26 May 2018 , after securing their first win at Wembley in their 139 year history . | Question: when was the last time fulham played at wembley ?", ['26 May 2018'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-46775'), ("Context: The first public performance of the song was by Bing Crosby , on his NBC radio show The Kraft Music Hall on Christmas Day , 1941 ; a copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by Crosby 's estate and was loaned to CBS News Sunday Morning for their December 25 , 2011 , program . He subsequently recorded the song with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra and the Ken Darby Singers and for Decca Records in just 18 minutes on May 29 , 1942 , and it was released on July 30 as part of an album of six 78 - rpm discs from the musical film Holiday Inn .

B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY     1900  •S     Anthony van Dyck.      aking into consideration the intellectual life of the  Flemish and of the Dutch in general, the painters are  undoubtedly the most gifted of our countrymen. The  taste for Art was most lavishly bestowed upon them,  they have been the creating genius of our race, men with  keener eyes and more subtle feeling and with a hand more cunning  than the majority of their "fellow countrymen. They have been  instrumental in bringing the people of the low-lying countries to the  fore, causing them to rank amongst the highest in the Ideal world.  Now the most poetical of these painters was Anthony van Dyck, that is  to say if one understands by that word « poetical » a certain suscep-  tibility for impressions, and an inclination to be touched by emotions,  as may be termed sorrowful, suffering and tender.   Van Dyck was endowed with more feeling than strength, he  offered apparently but little resistance to the influence of others, yet  his natural disposition and his fine artistic taste were not submerged  by the powerful impression made on him by his illustrious prede-  cessors. These impressions, it may be said, he outgrew rather than  threw off, and drifted unconsciously into an independence which  ripened and matured through the increasing power of his matchless  talent. Born in Antwerp, of the bluest blood, he loved his native town  and with true artistic feeling was carried away and enraptured by  all that may be called beautiful, brilliant and glowing ; he surpassed  all others by the sensibility of his character, by the distinction of his  style, by his power to charm and by his love of the eminent. The  tender graceful sensitiveness of his nature made him a striking contrast  to and a protest against that boorishness and sluggishness, which are  considered by some the characteristics of our nation.   Such van Dyck appears to us as artist when we take a broad and     impartial view of him, but upon a nearer acquaintance his talents  become more sharply defined, especially when viewed by the glimpses  we get of his life and from a closer examination of his work.   So too he appears to us as a man : of noble exterior, conscious of  his own worth, speaking by the spirit that vibrates through his whole  being and which overshadows his surroundings through the charm  of his personality. He looks what he is, the portrayer of princes, of  eminent men and of noble ladies, of Madonnas and Saints, and above  all the painter of the Man of Sorrows and the Mother of Woe.   Anthony was born in Antwerp on the 22nd March 1599. ^^is  father belonged to one of the highly respectable Burgher families  of the town. A few years ago the portrait of his Grandmother,  Cornelia Pruystinck, was discovered in the Modena Museum, and  the question arose whether the young artist had not perhaps copied  this picture from a portrait by some other artist ; van Dyck\'s  mother was celebrated | Question: Breugel; Van Dyck and Rubens were all citizens of which country?', ['belgium'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7578'), ("Context: Heigl garnered critical acclaim for her performance as Izzie and received numerous awards and nominations for her role , winning the `` Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Drama Series '' at the 2007 Emmy Awards .

She declined to put herself forward for the 2008 Emmy Awards , citing insufficient material in the role .

How to Write 225 Words Per Minute With a Pen - The AtlanticHow to Write 225 Words Per Minute With a Pen - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  How to Write 225 Words Per Minute With a Pen  A lesson in the lost technology of shorthand  Students in the shorthand class at Broken Bow College, 1903. Nebraska State Historical Society  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  As a journalist, I begin most interviews by holding up my pen and asking, “Have you ever seen one of these?” No one ever has.  It’s not an ordinary pen, of course. It’s a Sky wifi smartpen , a piece of gee-whiz technology from a company called Livescribe. Basically, the smartpen replaces all your standard reporter’s tools. To start with, it’s an old-fashioned pen for old-fashioned paper, so I can still scribble my notes the way I always have. The smartpen is also a high-quality digital recorder, creating an audio file of the interview as we go along. Finally, a tiny camera near the tip of the pen simultaneously takes pictures of my notes as I write.  Gregg is a way of compressing language. You are the machine that does the encoding and decoding. And your brain can do it in real time at very, very high speeds.  All of that information is then pulled together by a microprocessor housed in the barrel of the pen. And because the smartpen is really a computer, it’s able to sync up the picture of my handwritten notes with the audio file. That means I can tap the tip of the pen anywhere in my notebook, and the pen will instantly replay the audio of whatever was being said when I took that note. And since it’s WiFi enabled, the whole interview—audio file, notes, and all—is automatically uploaded to my Evernote account. It’s a little like magic.  There’s one other feature I like to point out. It’s possible, I tell people, to get optical character recognition software to go with the pen. If you write like a normal person, the OCR will automatically convert your handwritten notes into a text file that you can then copy and paste into your word processor. For many reporters, this is the best feature, obviating the painful task of transcribing long interviews. But it doesn’t work for me, I explain, because even though I’m recording this interview with the latest model Sky wifi smartpen, I’m taking notes using a 19th Century technology called Gregg shorthand | Question: What is the American word for a short-hand typist?', ['stenographer', 'shorthand typist', 'shorthand'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-4123'), ("Context: After viewing Carpenter 's film Assault on Precinct 13 ( 1976 ) at the Milan Film Festival , independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct a film for them about a psychotic killer that stalked babysitters .

The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century , by Isaac Newton , as an alternative to the refracting telescope which , at that time , was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration . Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations , it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives . Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors . Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position .

This is from Wikipedia:  "The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner," and as such is related to the names of several other European regions where Germanic peoples came into contact with indigenous non-Germanic cultures, including: Wallonia (Belgium), Valais (Switzerland), and Wallachia (Romania), as well as the "-wall" of Cornwall and even the "wal-" in the walnut tree. However, it has also been suggested that the prefix "Wall" acknowledges a people who had contact with the Roman empire (see Vlach)."  Damian in Edinburgh \xa0 Tue Nov 06, 2007 9:18 am GMT  ***"The name "Wales", however, comes from a Germanic root word meaning (ironically) "stranger" or "foreigner,"***  Ironically is indeed the operative word here.   As far as the English, particularly, are concerned, the Welsh people have always been considered more "foreign" than have the other constituent member races of the entire British Isles, including what is now the people of the Republic of Ireland, who, technically, are really foreigners.   Certainly we Scots have not been seen in quite the same light by the English as have the Welsh people as an entity.  I think that several factors are involved in this English perception of the Welsh as being "more foreign" - one being, of course, the survival of the Welsh Language, a Language seen as quite alien to English itself in so many ways.    There are characteristics of Welsh that are more similar to some Continental Languages than there are to English.   Bearing in mind the nature of the Welsh Language, you then have to consider the physical closeness of Wales to the main body of England geographically - ie the Midlands and Southern England generally, the areas most seen as the political powerhouse of England politically and culturally.  Here in Scotland we are considerably further away in distance from much of England (including London and the Home Counties) yet we are not seen as being as "foreign" as the Welsh as we do not have the "advantage" of a separate Language like they have.  Many English people feel a real sense of "difference" when crossing the border out of England and into Wales which they don\'t quite feel when driving out of England into Scotland.   I think that is entirely due to the sudden change from Anglo Saxon place names in England to the "foreign" looking Welsh place names in Wales - not to mention the fact that all road signs immediately become bi-lingual, including road markings ie "Araf" "meaning "Slow" painted on the road surfaces.  Each time I\'ve driven over the English/Welsh border (four times now) I noticed that at first the English word took precedence above the Welsh word, but the further into Wales you go - ie further into the strongholds of the still surviving (and flourishing) Welsh Language the Welsh word takes precedence.  This simply doesn\'t happen when travelling back and forth over the Scottish / English border which I have done countless numbers of times - if I had a quid for each time I\'ve crossed the border I\'d have a bloody good holiday on one of the Greek islands....or take a cruise down the Nile..I\'d love to go and take a peek at the newly resurrected King Tut.

In his works he       blends elements of the traditional gothic (bleak and threatening) tale       with those of the modern psychological (how the mind works) thriller,       detective, and science fiction stories.  His early years  Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine.         When he was two years old, his father left the family, leaving his         mother to care for Stephen and his older brother, David. She took a         series of low-paying jobs to support her children, and as a result the         boys saw little of their mother.  As a boy King found a box of fantasyhorror fiction books and stories         that had belonged to his father, and he read them all. By the time King         was seven he had begun writing his own stories. He enjoyed watching         science fiction and monster movies.  "Writing has always been it for me," King indicated in a         panel discussion at the 1984 World Fantasy Convention in Ottawa, Canada.         Science fiction and adventure stories comprised his first literary         efforts. King began submitting short fiction to magazines when he was         twelve. He had no success at that time selling his stories, but he did         win first prize in an essay competition sponsored by a scholastic         magazine. In high school King authored a small, satiric (poking fun at         human weakness) newspaper entitled The Village Vomit. He published his first story at eighteen in a magazine called Comics Review.  King graduated from high school in 1966. He received a Bachelor of Arts         degree in English from the University of Maine in 1970. He married         Tabitha Spruce, also a writer, the following year. They have three         children.  After college  After graduating from college, King taught English at a high school in         Maine and added to his income by holding a number of part-time jobs and         by writing short stories for several popular magazines. He did not         receive much money from the sale of his stories. Sometimes he was not         paid at all but was           given extra copies of the magazine to show or sell to other people.  King\'s first novel was Carrie, published in 1974. It was a huge success, which allowed King to quit         his other jobs and write full-time. With this book, King became one of         the top writers of horror stories.  Popularity  King\'s fiction features everyday language, attention to the         details of the story\'s surroundings, the emotional feelings of         his characters, realistic settings, and an emphasis on modern problems.         King\'s popularity comes from his ability to create stories in         which evil occurs in ordinary situations.  Many of King\'s stories are semiautobiographical, meaning that         they are taken in part from some of his own experiences. Many of the         locations he writes about are based on the places he grew up in when he         lived in Maine and other locations. Many of his stories deal with         ordinary people who are faced with frightening events they have to try         to understand and overcome.  A publishing marvel, King has nearly one hundred million copies of his         works in print worldwide. He is the first writer to have had three,         four, and finally five titles appear simultaneously (at the same time)         on the New York Times bestseller list.  How King approaches writing  Some of King\'s works are variations (different ways of telling)         on classic stories of fantasy and horror. Salem\'s Lot, for example, is a contemporary (modern) version of Bram Stoker\'s         (1847–1912) novel Dracula, set in an isolated New England town. King\'s epic (long  Stephen King.

Albarn has since gone on to form virtual band Gorillaz, to huge commercial and critical success.  His projects have included supergroup The Good, The Bad & The Queen and the much-lauded Monkey: Journey To The West.

Following a stylistic change in the mid-1990s, influenced by 1960s English pop groups such as The Kinks and The Beatles, the band released Modern Life is Rubbish, Parklife and The Great Escape.

Published on Jan 22, 2015  Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen BEST AUDIO  There was once a woman who wished very much to have a little child, but she could not obtain her wish. At last she went to a fairy, and said, "I should so very much like to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?"     "Oh, that can be easily managed," said the fairy. "Here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer\'s fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen."     "Thank you," said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. Then she went home and planted it, and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower, something like a tulip in appearance, but with its leaves tightly closed as if it were still a bud.     "It is a beautiful flower," said the woman, and she kissed the red and golden-colored leaves, and while she did so the flower opened, and she could see that it was a real tulip. Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of "Thumbelina," or Tiny, because she was so small. A walnut-shell, elegantly polished, served her for a cradle; her bed was formed of blue violet-leaves, with a rose-leaf for a counterpane. Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water. Round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, which served Tiny for a boat. Here the little maiden sat and rowed herself from side to side, with two oars made of white horse-hair. It really was a very pretty sight. Tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard.  Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen BEST AUDIO  Please subscribe for more great audio books.

In the first English translation of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale opens with a beggar woman giving a peasant\'s wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants the miniature maiden as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag-beetle. The insect discards her when his friends reject her company. Thumbelina tries to protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old fieldmouse and tends her dwelling in gratitude.

For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect\'s talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators\' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote, "My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with--for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action." | Question: What reasons cause failure of the disobedience with authorities?', ['lack of understanding', "a suspect's talking to criminal investigators", 'lack of understanding of the legal ramifications,', 'lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-6924'), ('Context: \'The Valley Farm\', John Constable | Tate\'The Valley Farm\', John Constable, 1835  | Tate  The Valley Farm  Support: 1473 x 1251 mm  frame: 1795 x 1575 x 170 mm  Collection  Presented by Robert Vernon 1847  Reference  Catalogue entry  Summary  This work shows a view of Willy Lott\'s House at Flatford from the River Stour. The farmer lived continuously in the same house for over eighty years and for Constable it came to represent an important part of the Suffolk landscape, a nostalgic symbol of the \'natural\' way of life. The building features prominently in earlier works by Constable, including The Mill Stream (circa 1810, Tate N01816 ) and The Hay Wain (1820-1, National Gallery, London).  The house is viewed through the cutting that led from the river Stour to the mill stream of Flatford mill. The composition is based on two earlier workings of the subject, The Ferry (1814, private collection) and, more particularly, Willy Lot\'s House from the Stour (1816-18, private collection). A number of features are based on this second and slightly smaller version, including the timberwork in the left foreground, the figures on the far bank and the boat just beside it, the man at the gate and the tiny bird skimming the surface of the water. The most obvious additions to The Valley Farm are the ferryman, boat and female passenger (based on a study in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London), and the three cows that precede them, the last one turning its head to look up.  The house has been modified and made to look grander with the addition of half-timbering on one side and some extra windows.  The trees on the right of the picture are also larger, more expressive and more contorted than in earlier versions and there is a development towards looser and more expressive handling of paint. The surface of the canvas is is heavily worked and Constable has applied flecks of white paint to bring the picture to life.  Constable devoted a large amount of time to reworking The Valley Farm, and there is, in this painting , a sense of the aging artist attempting to revive old images and past emotions.  Constable himself was extremely enthusiastic about the results, but when the picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1835 it was not well received and one critic wrote, \'He ought to be whipped for thus maiming a real genius for Landscape \' (quoted in Parris and Fleming-Williams 1991, p.378). Nevertheless Constable sold the picture in the same year to the notable collector Robert Vernon (1774-1849) for his new house at 50 Pall Mall. Vernon paid him £300, the largest price Constable had ever received for a picture. It was later included in Vernon\'s gift to the National Gallery, London, in 1847.

In the 1984 Olympics, there were no women\'s World Records set.  Leigh Ann Fetter was the first woman to break 22 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle with a 21.92 at the 1990 NCAA Championships.  Of current world record holders, Mary T Meagher has held a world record the longest. She first set the record in the 200-meter butterfly in 1979 and has broken it an additional four times to the current standard of 2:05.96. She also owns the 10 of the 12 fastest times in history in the event.  Since the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896, U.S. men have earned 207 medals, including 90 golds. Since women\'s swimming was added to the Olympic program in 1920, the U.S. representatives have won 140 medals, including 63 gold.  At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, the U.S. men\'s 400 meter medley relay consisted of all four 100-meter stroke world record holders, the only time this has happened in swimming history.

The gold went to William Dickey with a plunge of 62�6�.  Gold medalist hopeful Felix Farrell swam in the 1960 U.S. Olympic Time Trials only six days after an appendectomy. Not fully recovered, he placed fourth in the 100-meter free. This finish was good enough to put him on the 800-meter and 400-meter freestyle relays in which he recovered sufficiently to anchor the U.S. teams to World Records in both events.  At the 1972 Olympic Games, Steve Genter suffered a collapsed lung only days before his event.

Granville cut the clownish Gobbos in line with neoclassical decorum ; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio , and a more extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene . Thomas Doggett was Shylock , playing the role comically , perhaps even farcically .

Get all the facts and figures.  Share this:  What is the smallest country in the world?  Author  What is the smallest country in the world?  URL  Google  It may be difficult to imagine, but there is a country in the world smaller than New York City’s Central Park and one with a population smaller than a typical high-school class. Based on landmass, Vatican City is the smallest country in the world, measuring just 0.2 square miles, almost 120 times smaller than the island of Manhattan. Situated on the western bank of the Tiber River, Vatican City’s 2-mile border is landlocked by Italy. The official seat of the pope of the Catholic Church since 1377, Vatican City was not declared an independent state until the Lateran Treaty of 1929. After years of power struggles between popes and the political leaders of Italy over who could claim supreme authority in the region, Benito Mussolini and Pope Pius XI agreed to the Lateran Pacts on February 11, 1929, which created the independent state of Vatican City for the Catholic Church in exchange for the pope’s recognition of the Kingdom of Italy. Today, nearly 75 percent of the Vatican’s citizens are members of the clergy.  In comparing countries by population, however, Vatican City loses out to the Pitcairn Islands for the title of smallest country. Compared to the 800-850 residents who live in Vatican City, the population of the Pitcairn Islands has fluctuated between 40 and 60 inhabitants over recent years. This British territory, located in the Pacific Ocean halfway between Peru and New Zealand, is composed of four islands, but Pitcairn is the only one that is inhabited. Pitcairn’s tiny population is also noteworthy due to its peoples’ heritage: They are descended from Tahitians and the mutineers on the Bounty. Fletcher Christian and eight other mutineers fled to Tahiti after their revolt at sea, but when hostilities arose with their new neighbors and they began to fear arrest, they escaped to the deserted island of Pitcairn to hide from British authorities, bringing a handful of Tahitians with them. The British rediscovered the islands in 1791 during a search for the mutineers, and they were named a British colony in 1838. Though the population has swelled since then to a whopping 223 just before World War II, the current population stands at about 50.  Considering the 50 smallest countries by landmass are each less than one-quarter of the size of Rhode Island and the 50 smallest countries by population are each about one-sixth the size of Washington, D.C., it really is a small world after all.

Wynn  Last Modified Date: 09 January 2017  Copyright Protected:  Top 10 facts about the world  According to the CIA World Factbook, there are 44 countries and other areas that are landlocked.  In simplest terms, this means that the country is devoid of coastline. This status is critical for many nations because it prevents unfettered access to the open ocean which, in turn, allows for trade with most of the countries in the world.  Goods produced in a country without access to open water, for example, must always be transported through another country before traveling to their destination.  The status of being landlocked does not appear to be just a superficial aspect of a country.  For example, the average gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita for the world is approximately $15,000 US Dollars (USD).  Of the world's landlocked countries, only a few, such as Switzerland and Austria , have higher GDPs per capita than this average.

Born Autry DeWalt and raised in South Bend, Indiana, Walker moved to small Battle Creek, Michigan as a young musician.\xa0 He was discovered by legendary singer and producer Harvey Fuqua and joined Motown with Fuqua\'s Harvey label in the early 60s.\xa0 Backed by a tight trio of musicians known as the AllStars (Tony Washington, Willie Woods and Victor Thomas), Walker scored in 1965 with the now classic cut "Shotgun."\xa0 With his always-rough vocals leading the way through a sing-songy refrain, the infectious, mostly instrumental cut shot to the top of the Soul charts and hit the Pop top five.  Over the next half decade Junior Walker and the AllStars released a number of top ten Soul hits, including "I\'m a Roadrunner," "How Sweet It Is," "Shake and Fingerpop," "Gotta Hold On To This Feeling" and a cover of "These Eyes."\xa0 He moved to the top of the pop and Soul charts again in 1969 with the great ballad "What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)" (later remade by Kenny G and Lenny Williams).\xa0 The hits stopped coming for him by 1973, but he continued to record sporadically over the remainder of the decade.  Walker\'s career received an unexpected boost in 1981 when the rock group Foreigner was recording a jumpy tune called "Urgent" and wanted to have a saxophone solo in the refrain.\xa0 Being Motown fans, they contacted Walker to fly to the studio to cut the piece.\xa0 As he told me in a 1982 interview, he had never heard of Foreigner, but the group had promised a pretty good payday for one song, so he agreed to fly to the studio and cut the record.\xa0 They played the raw track for him and asked him to improvise a solo.\xa0 After a single listening, he amazed the group by cutting one of the most memorable sax solos in rock history in one take.\xa0 The song went on to the top of the Pop charts and became a Walker concert staple for the next decade (he and a reconsititued AllStars recorded it on their final album, 1983\'s Blow Down the House).  Walker continued to tour with the AllStars over the next decade.\xa0 Sadly, he died of cancer at his Battle Creek home in 1995 and\xa0 Willie Woods died about a year later.\xa0 Original All-Stars Victor Thomas and Tony Washington teamed with new members Kenny Walker and Acklee King in the late 90s and have been playing ever since as Jr. Walker\'s All-Star Band.

Its nickname, “The Roaring Game”, originates from the rumbling sound the 44-pound (19.96kg) granite stones make when they travel across the ice.  Scottish origins  One of the world’s oldest team sports, curling originated in the 16th century in Scotland, where games were played during winter on frozen ponds and lochs. The earliest-known curling stones came from the Scottish regions of Stirling and Perth and date from 1511. In the 1600s, stones with handles were introduced.  Key developments  The first curling clubs appeared in Scotland, with the Grand Caledonian Curling Club, formed in 1838, being responsible for formulating the first official rules of the sport. The Club was renamed the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in 1843. The key 20th-century developments in the sport have been the standardisation of the stone, the development of the slide delivery, and the use of indoor, refrigerated ice facilities.  Olympic history  Men’s curling was included in the Olympic programme in 1924 at the first Olympic Winter Games in Chamonix. It was then dropped, and later re-introduced as a demonstration sport in 1932 in Lake Placid.  Between 1936 and 1992, curling was staged at the Games as a demonstration sport: in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1936 and Innsbruck in 1964, under the German name of “Eisschiessen”; and in 1988 in Calgary and in 1992 in Albertville, with both men’s and women’s events.  It was in Nagano in 1998 that it officially joined the Olympic programme, with both men’s and women’s competitions.  World Curling Federation - Curling at the Olympic GamesWorld Curling Federation - Curling at the Olympic Games  >> Home > Olympic Winter Games  Curling at the Olympic Games  Curling made its debut as an Olympic Winter Sport at the first Winter Games at Chamonix in 1924. At this event Great Britain defeated Sweden and France in what was retroactively accepted in 2006 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and medals were awarded.  In 1932 at the Lake Placid Olympic Winter Games, curling again was listed but this time as a demonstration sport . Canada was a winner over the United States in a two-country competition in which each country entered four Men’s teams.  Curling was a demonstration sport for a second and third time at the Olympic Winter Games of 1988 (Calgary) and 1992 (Albertville) for teams of men and women.  On 21 July 1992, at its session in Barcelona, Spain, the International Olympic Committee granted official medal status to Men’s and Women’s Curling, to take effect no later than the Olympic Winter Games of 2002, with an option for 1998 at Nagano, Japan.  During the meeting of the IOC Executive Board held June 22-23, 1993 in Lausanne, the Organizing Committee of the Nagano Olympic Winter Games (NAOC) officially agreed to include Curling in the programme of the XVIII Olympic Winter Games in 1998. Eight teams for men and women participated in Nagano, this was increased to ten teams from the Salt Lake City Olympic Winter Games (2002) onwards.  In the Women’s competition at the Nagano 1998 Olympic Winter Games, Canada defeated Denmark to capture the first ever Women’s Curling gold medal. At the Salt Lake Games in 2002, Great Britain defeated Switzerland and Sweden took home the gold medal at the Torino 2006 Olympic Winter Games, with Switzerland winning their second consecutive Olympic Silver medal. Sweden repeated their golden glory at the Vancouver 2010 Games with Canada settling for silver.  At the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Switzerland’s Men’s team defeated Canada to capture the gold medal. Canada was a runner-up again at the Salt Lake Games in 2002 when the Norwegian men beat them to gain the gold.

Prince Charles and Princess Diana took up residence at Highgrove House soon after they were married in 1981.  "I knew I wanted to take care of the place in a very personal way and to leave it one day, in a far better condition than I found it."  HRH The Prince of Wales on Highgrove  The Duchy of Cornwall acquired Highgrove House from the MP Maurice Macmillan, son of former Tory Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1980.  The purchase added to the nation\'s speculation that the Prince was considering marriage.  Highgrove became the first home for Charles and Diana\'s young sons Princes William and Harry and they spent much of their early years on the estate prior to starting school.  Princess Diana is reported to have made many shopping trips to neighbouring Tetbury and Cirencester during her years at Highgrove and locals became used to seeing her and the young Princes out and about in the area.  Diana left Highgrove in the 1990s  Diana officially moved out of Highgrove following the breakdown of her marriage to Charles in the early 1990s.  Highgrove remains the official residence of Prince Charles. He has used the 37-acre estate to promote his interest in organic farming and gardening.  The Prince is well known for his love of nature and in his book Highgrove: Portrait of an Estate he writes: "I had absolutely no experience of gardening or farming, and the only trees I had planted had been official ones in very official holes.  "I knew I wanted to take care of the place in a very personal way and to leave it one day, in a far better condition than I found it".  Prince Charles lives at Highgrove  He is reputed to have spent £500,000 on the gardens at Highgrove taking advice on plants and design from famous garden expert Rosemary Verey of nearby Barnsley House before her death in the late 1990s.  Highgrove featured in a BBC Natural World TV documentary narrated by David Attenborough in January 2003.
