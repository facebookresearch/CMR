In addition , this song also reveals that Eminem had tried to stop Ja Rule & 50 Cent 's feud , but lost it when he heard Ja Rule making fun of his daughter on a track called `` Loose Change '' -- ( `` The Ja Shit , I tried to squash it , It was too late to stop it , There 's a certain line you just do n't cross and he crossed it , I heard him say Hailie 's name on a song and I just lost it '' ) . In the song `` Loose Change '' , Ja Rule says Eminem claims his then ex-wife is `` a known slut '' and his mother `` a crackhead '' , and then asks him `` so what 's Hailie gon na be when she grows up ?

After Nirvana disbanded following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994 , Novoselic formed Sweet 75 in the same year and Eyes Adrift in 2002 , releasing one album with each band . From 2006 to 2009 he played in the punk band Flipper , and in 2011 contributed bass and accordion to the song `` I Should Have Known '' , on Foo Fighters ' studio album Wasting Light , along with playing bass guitar and accordion in Giants in the Trees since June 2016 . | Question: what happened to the third guy in nirvana ?", ['death'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-38540'), ('Context: Vegetable oils and animal fats are the traditional materials that are saponified . These greasy materials , triesters called triglycerides , are mixtures derived from diverse fatty acids . Triglycerides can be converted to soap in either a one - or a two - step process . In the traditional one - step process , the triglyceride is treated with a strong base ( e.g. , lye ) , which cleaves the ester bond , releasing fatty acid salts ( soaps ) and glycerol . This process is also the main industrial method for producing glycerol . In some soap - making , the glycerol is left in the soap .

A story which explores the lives and relationships of four generations of women : Doris , Margaret , Jackie and Rosie . Their loves , expectations , and choices are set against the huge social changes of the twentieth century . When Jackie falls pregnant with Rosie , without a husband , she is unable to cope and hands over the baby to her mother , Margaret . The play looks at the consequences of this secret and each woman 's opinion on it . The play has a minimalist set and is deliberately unrealistic . One of the most unrealistic things in the play is the waste ground scenes where all characters become children . In these scenes , Doris becomes the youngest child at 5 , with Rosie at 8 and Jackie and Margaret both 9 . Some viewers have said that `` it works backwards on itself which can get rather confusing . '' The scenes do not follow in chronological order , so in one scene Margaret will be a young child during the war being comforted by her mother Doris and in the next Jackie will be a child visiting her grandma Doris . This can also be slightly confusing because it is not specifically mentioned how old the characters are in each scene , but mostly it is very self - explanatory . | Question: themes in my mother said i never should ?", ['secrets', 'independence', 'growing up'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-50212'), ("Context: In transfusions of packed red blood cells , individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors .

They are subsequently moved to absorptive enterocyte cells lining the intestines . The triglycerides are rebuilt in the enterocytes from their fragments and packaged together with cholesterol and proteins to form chylomicrons . These are excreted from the cells and collected by the lymph system and transported to the large vessels near the heart before being mixed into the blood . Various tissues can capture the chylomicrons , releasing the triglycerides to be used as a source of energy . Liver cells can synthesize and store triglycerides . When the body requires fatty acids as an energy source , the hormone glucagon signals the breakdown of the triglycerides by hormone - sensitive lipase to release free fatty acids . As the brain can not utilize fatty acids as an energy source ( unless converted to a ketone ) , the glycerol component of triglycerides can be converted into glucose , via gluconeogenesis by conversion into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and then into glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate , for brain fuel when it is broken down .

It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps . In common with other Greek temples , it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns ( `` peripteral '' ) carrying an entablature . There are eight columns at either end ( `` octastyle '' ) and seventeen on the sides . There is a double row of columns at either end . The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure , the cella , which is divided into two compartments . At either end of the building the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures . The columns are of the Doric order , with simple capitals , fluted shafts and no bases . Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels ( metopes ) , separated by formal architectural triglyphs , typical of the Doric order . Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured frieze in low relief .

Earth 's rotation is slowing slightly with time ; thus , a day was shorter in the past . This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth 's rotation . Atomic clocks show that a modern day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago , slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds . Analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend of 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century BC E . | Question: how long is earth 's rotation on its axis ?", ['about 24'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-34758'), ("Context: The series centers around Dora , a 7 ( Later 8 ) year old American girl of Indigenous Mexican heritage , with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to , accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots ( named for his beloved pair of red boots ) . Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora 's travels , along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve ( with `` assistance '' from the viewing audience ) relating to riddles , the Spanish language , or counting . Common rituals may involve Dora 's encounters with Swiper , a bipedal , anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall - breaking interaction with the viewer . To stop Swiper , Dora must say `` Swiper no swiping '' three times . However , on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people , the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items . Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program 's antagonists ; the `` Grumpy Old Troll '' dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross , who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer 's help . Known for the constant breaking of the fourth - wall depicted in every episode , the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination , normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way . The episode always ends with Dora successfully reaching the locale , singing the `` We Did It !

The last of the three original songs written for the remake , `` Evermore '' was completed considerably late into production after the filmmakers finally agreed that the Beast should perform his own . Written in Spring 2015 in London , England , Menken quickly composed its melody before Rice contributed lyrics revolving around the Beast releasing Belle . Actor Dan Stevens , who portrays the Beast and performs `` Evermore '' , had little singing experience prior to being cast in the film . Before `` Evermore '' was written , Condon informed Stevens that he would be singing a new song in his role as Beast . Having not sung professionally since childhood , Stevens was required to retrain his singing voice , the process of which he found challenging . To prepare for the recording , Stevens received extensive vocal coaching from vocal coach Ann - Marie Speed in addition to working closely with Menken . Stevens first recorded a `` guide track '' for `` Evermore '' before he and Menken revisited the track to modify specific lines and notes . To make the actor sound more `` beast - like '' , sound engineers digitally modified Stevens ' voice , which Menken produced himself . Auto - Tune was used to make Stevens ' voice sound lower and heavier . Menken continued making minor changes to the song well into production . On recording a new song , Stevens said , `` the pressure 's sort of off -- but it 's also on -- because it does n't have to sound like it did before , but it should sound good enough to sit alongside the music that 's already pretty great . '' Stevens agreed that the song is `` a big , romantic , soaring number '' about the Beast lamenting `` I 've fallen in love with her , and now she 's buggered off , woe is me '' , while `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' is `` How am I going to fall in love with her ? '' Replacing `` If I Ca n't Love Her '' with `` Evermore '' helped make the songwriters eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song . | Question: who sang for dan stevens in beauty and the beast ?", ['Dan Stevens'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-17258'), ("Context: The Lancashire textile mills were major parts of the British industrial revolution .

Let’s celebrate their union by giving some facts about the happy couple:-  The Bride – Mary Queen of Scots  Birth: Mary, Queen of Scots, also known as Mary Stuart, Mary Stewart and Marie Stuart, was born on the 8th December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland.  Parents: Mary’s parents were James V of Scotland (son of James IV and Margaret Tudor) and Mary of Guise. She was James’s only child to survive and he actually died six days after her birth.  Queen of Scotland After her father’s death on the 14th December, Mary became Queen of Scotland and was crowned at Stirling in September 1543. As Mary was just an infant, the country was ruled by regents on her behalf.  Betrothals: On the 1st July 1543, at the age of 7 months, the Treaty of Greenwich, between England and Scotland, promised Mary in marriage to Henry VIII’s son, Prince Edward. When the pro-Catholic and pro-French Cardinal Beaton became powerful in Scotland and joined forces with the Earl of Arran, the treaty was rejected by the Scottish Parliament and trouble began between England and Scotland. The French came to the aid of Scotland and on the 7th July 1548 a marriage treaty between France and Scotland promised the 5 year old Mary in marriage to Henry II’s son, François, the Dauphin.  Upbringing: From the age of 5 until the age of 19 Mary lived in France. There she received an excellent education, learning French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin and Scots, as well as music, needlework and poetry.  Return to Scotland: Francois (Francis II of France) died in 1560 and his mother, Catherine de’ Medici, took control of the country, as regent for her other son, Charles IX. Mary returned to Scotland on the 19th August 1561.  Marriages: 24th April 1558 to the Dauphin François at Notre Dame. he died in 1560. 29th July 1565 to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, he was assassinated in 1567. 15th May 1567 to James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, he died in 1578.  Mary and her son James  Issue: James VI of Scotland (James I of England) by Lord Darnley, born on 19th June 1566. Mary miscarried twins (fathered by Bothwell) in July 1567.  Titles: Queen of Scotland from 14th December 1542 until 24th July 1567 when she was forced to abdicate.  At the death of Mary I of England in 1558, Henry II of France declared that François and Mary were King and Queen of England and Mary started bearing the royal arms of England.  On the death of her father-in-law, Henry II of France, on the 10th July 1559 Mary became Queen Consort of France, a position she held until 5th December 1560.  Appearance: Mary, Queen of Scots, was considered a beauty. She was tall (around 5′ 11) with auburn hair, hazel eyes and a heart-shaped face.  Scandal: In March 1566, Mary’s husband, Lord Darnley, and some friends murdered Mary’s private secretary, David Rizzio, in front of his pregnant wife. He was jealous of Mary’s friendship with Rizzio. Darnley became a real problem for Mary and the Scottish Lords and in February 1567 Darnley was killed in an explosion at Kirk O’Field. It is thought that James Hepburn, Lord Bothwell, supplied the gunpowder but he was acquitted of murder in April 1567. The famous “Casket Letters” implicated Mary in the murder of her husband, but these are generally believed to have been forgeries.

Born in Fuyuki City , Kiritsugu was raised on Alimango Island , where he lived with his father , Norikata Emiya , the fourth family head of the Emiya family and a magus specializing in time magic . He became friends with Norikata 's assistant , a local girl called Shirley who was four years older than him , developing a crush on her . However , disaster struck when Shirley became a vampire after drinking one of Noritaka 's potions . She pled for Kiritsugu to kill her , but he fled instead . Shirley subsequently lost control and turned all the residents of Alimango Island into vampires . </Dd> <Dd> Their village was soon overrun by Executors from the Church and Enforcers from the Mages ' Association , agents whose purpose was to destroy all the vampires and eliminate any trace of civilization and vampirism on the island respectively . Kiritsugu was the only survivor of the ' cleansing ' , saved by Natalia Kaminski , a freelance Enforcer who wanted information on the magus responsible . Returning to the hidden Emiya residence , Kiritsugu confronted his father on his research and Shirley 's death . Upon mercy killing Natalia in the process of killing another vampire , who at that point had become like a mother to Kiritsugu . It was then that he became disillusioned with the ideal of becoming a ' hero of justice ' , as he realized it was impossible to save one person without losing another . </Dd> <Dd> Around eleven years before the fourth Holy Grail War , he took on a child soldier he had rescued as his apprentice , who he eventually named Maiya Hisau , training her in much the same way Natalia trained him . Two years later , Kiritsugu was hired by the Einzbern family to be their representative in the coming conflict . Believing that the Holy Grail could grant his wish for world peace , he left behind his former work . Despite being the true Master of the Einzbern family , Kiritsugu operates mostly in the background during the conflict , ambushing other Masters when they are otherwise occupied , while Saber is partnered with Irisviel and made to act out in the open . This is to avoid conflict between Kiritsugu and Saber , as the methodologies of the two conflict with each other too much . Over the course of the War , Kiritsugu 's mask of stoicism begins to crack , revealing the cold assassin to be nothing but an unstable manchild who fears not being able to let go of his wife when the time comes . During his final fight with Kirei , Kiritsugu is dragged into the Grail and , after being confronted with the Grail 's true nature ( which was corrupted by Angra Mainyu in the previous Holy Grail War ) and is shown only a twisted version of his wish to save as many people as possible where everyone dies . He resists it by killing manifestations of his wife and daughter created by the Grail , and orders Saber to destroy the Grail after realizing its corruption . However , the Grail is unable to be destroyed and its corrupted nature causes a huge fire . Kiritsugu desperately looks for survivors , discovering an amnesiac boy who he names Shirō and adopts . Kiritsugu then spends months trying to retrieve Illya , but Angra Mainyu 's curse robbed him of his magical abilities and physical health while Acht strictly trains Illya to become the next vessel under the impression that her father abandoned her . Eventually , Kiritsugu dies while watching the moon with his adopted son and talking about his dream to become a hero , believing that at the very least he would n't grow up to be like him .

The venom contains some substances ( RVV - V and RVV - X ) which directly activate factor V and factor X , which turns prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of phospholipid and calcium . In the dRVVT assay , low , rate - limiting concentrations of both Russell 's viper venom and phospholipid are used to give a standard clotting time of 23 to 27 seconds . This makes the test sensitive to the presence of lupus anticoagulants , because these antibodies interfere with the clot - promoting role of phospholipid in vitro , and their presence results in a prolonged clotting time . A mixing study is then performed , which consists of adding an equal volume of the patient 's plasma to normal plasma ; in this study , one would expect the clotting time to return to the normal range if there was only a deficiency of coagulation factors alone . A prolonged clotting time of 30 seconds or greater that does not correct despite the mixing study suggests the presence of a lupus anticoagulant . An abnormal result for the initial dRVVT assay should be followed by a dRVVT confirmatory test . In this test , the inhibitory effect of lupus anticoagulants on phospholipids in the dRVVT can be overcome by adding an excess of phospholipid to the assay . The clotting times of both the initial dRVVT assay and confirmatory test are normalized and then used to determine a ratio of time without phospholipid excess to time with phospholipid excess . In general , a ratio of greater than 1.3 is considered a positive result and implies that the patient may have antiphospholipid antibodies . The dRVVT test has a higher specificity than the aPTT test for the detection of lupus anticoagulant , because it is not influenced by deficiencies or inhibitors of clotting factors VIII , IX or XI as the venom only activates factors V and X . | Question: dilute russell 's viper venom test ( drvvt ) which coagulation factor is activated by the venom ?", ['factor V', 'factor X'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-59008'), ("Context: Though not appearing in Tekken 7 's original arcade release , Nina returns in its updated title , Tekken 7 : Fated Retribution .

He stands out in the history of Grand Prix motor racing for his much copied 'straight-arm' driving style and his status as the first ever Formula One World Champion.The first ever Formula One World Champion came from a privileged background and had a stylish driving technique that was adopted by many drivers. A hard and determined racer, Farina relied on a combination of profound self belief and raw courage to compensate for the superior skills possessed by many of his more naturally talented opponents. Yet he also drove recklessly and few Formula One drivers ever competed with such apparent disregard for their personal safety. Somehow surviving an accident-strewn racing career, he was eventually killed in a road accident. 'Nino' Farina was always destined to be involved in the automotive world, though not necessarily as a driver. On the day of his son’s birth, October 30, 1906, Nino's father Giovanni established Stabilimente Farina, a bodywork shop in Turin, the industrial city where much of Italy's car manufacturing industry was located. Here also, Giovanni's brother founded the coachbuilding firm of Pininfarina, later famed for designing many sleek Italian sportscars. From an early age Nino was expected to join the family business but his first driving experience, at the age of nine in a small car on the grounds of his father's factory, whetted his appetite for the sporting side of motoring. When he was 16 Nino accompanied his favourite uncle Pinin as a passenger in a race. Three years later his first solo competition ended in an accident, establishing a worrying trend that continued throughout his crash-prone career.  Farina was both athletically and academically inclined. In his youth he was a fast runner and became skilled at soccer and skiing. At the University of Turin he received a doctorate in law and became Dottore Giuseppe Farina. While his academic title came easily his route to becoming World Champion was less straightforward. He began his military service as a cavalry officer, much enjoying the sensation of handling horses, then joined a tank regiment, in which he would serve during the war. Meanwhile, he continued to be obsessed by the lure of mechanical horsepower harnessed for competition purposes. In 1932 he bought an Alfa Romeo and quickly crashed it in a hillclimb, breaking a shoulder and badly cutting his face. Undeterred, he raced Maseratis for a couple of years, crashing frequently but also showing enough promise to impress Enzo Ferrari, who recruited him to drive for the Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo team. There, Farina befriended the legendary Tazio Nuvolari, whose talent and tenacity were both instructional and inspirational. Under Tazio's tutelage he began to mature as a driver and in 1938 he won enough races to become Italian champion.After World War II Farina resumed racing and got married, to Elsa Giaretto, an elegant and stylish woman who ran an exclusive fashion emporium in Turin. In her opinion motor racing was a silly and dangerous activity and she tried to persuade her new husband to stop. But three days after their high society wedding he flew to a race in Argentina. In 1950 he was appointed leader of the three-car Alfa Romeo team that competed in the series of Grand Prix races that were now formally organized by the FIA into the first ever Formula One World Championship. Given the supremacy of their all-powerful Tipo 158 cars the first world driving title was bound to go to one of the Alfa Romeo trio, known collectively as 'the three F's.' Indeed, the venerable team mates Farina (44 years old), Juan Manuel Fangio (39) and Luigi Fagioli (52) finished in that order in the standings. Farina won the first ever Formula One championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and triumphed again in Switzerland and Italy. And while his team mate Fangio also won three races, for the fiercely proud Farina his being crowned World Champion only officially confirmed what he considered to be | Question: Nino Farina was the first world champion of what?", ['formula one championship', 'formula one world championship', 'formula 1', 'formula one'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-1521'), ("Context: Succession to the British throne is determined by descent , gender ( for people born before October 2011 ) , legitimacy , and religion .

This author uses an example of the contractile elements present in the porifera or sponges that do truly lack this striated muscle containing this protein . Furthermore , Steinmetz et al. present evidence for a polyphyletic origin of striated muscle cell development through their analysis of morphological and molecular markers that are present in bilaterians and absent in cnidarians , ctenophores , and bilaterians . Steimetz et al. showed that the traditional morphological and regulatory markers such as actin , the ability to couple myosin side chains phosphorylation to higher concentrations of the positive concentrations of calcium , and other MyHC elements are present in all metazoans not just the organisms that have been shown to have muscle cells . Thus , the usage of any of these structural or regulatory elements in determining whether or not the muscle cells of the cnidarians and ctenophores are similar enough to the muscle cells of the bilaterians to confirm a single lineage is questionable according to Steinmetz et al. Furthermore , Steinmetz et al. explain that the orthologues of the MyHc genes that have been used to hypothesize the origin of striated muscle occurred through a gene duplication event that predates the first true muscle cells ( meaning striated muscle ) , and they show that the MyHc genes are present in the sponges that have contractile elements but no true muscle cells . Furthermore , Steinmetz et all showed that the localization of this duplicated set of genes that serve both the function of facilitating the formation of striated muscle genes and cell regulation and movement genes were already separated into striated myhc and non-muscle myhc . This separation of the duplicated set of genes is shown through the localization of the striated myhc to the contractile vacuole in sponges while the non-muscle myhc was more diffusely expressed during developmental cell shape and change . Steinmetz et al. found a similar pattern of localization in cnidarians with except with the cnidarian N. vectensis having this striated muscle marker present in the smooth muscle of the digestive track . Thus , Steinmetz et al. argue that the pleisiomorphic trait of the separated orthologues of myhc can not be used to determine the monophylogeny of muscle , and additionally argue that the presence of a striated muscle marker in the smooth muscle of this cnidarian shows a fundamentally different mechanism of muscle cell development and structure in cnidarians . | Question: what type of muscle is the digestive system ?', ['smooth'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-72409'), ("Context: `` Girl Crush '' is a song written by Lori McKenna , Hillary Lindsey and Liz Rose , and performed by American country music group Little Big Town .

See all photos (15) in this gallery  By John Stratford (@Heart_JohnS), 8th August 2013, 10:50  Fifty years after The Great Train Robbery, an event\'s taken place to praise police who searched for the men who robbed a mail train in Buckinghamshire.  You may also like  On 8 August 1963, a gang of robbers, masterminded by Bruce Reynolds, stopped the Glasgow-Euston overnight mail train as it passed close to Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard.  On board were huge numbers of used bank notes.  Twelve of the robbers were jailed for a total of more than 300 years but more than one broke out of prison, including notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs, who spent over 30 years on the run before he finally returned to Britain in 2001 to face arrest.  Reynolds returned in 1968, five years after the crime, and was captured in Torquay and jailed for 25 years.  Two Buckinghamshire Constabulary police officers who were involved in the investigation attended a police commemoration event alongside serving Thames Valley Police officers at Eynsham Hall in Witney, Oxfordshire, on Wednesday 7 August 2013.  Keith Milner was a detective at Aylesbury at the time of the robbery, while John Woolley was a PC and discovered Leatherslade Farm near Brill, Buckinghamshire, where the men hid after committing the crime.  Biggs insisted in July 2013 that he was proud to have been part of the gang.  The famous fugitive, who celebrates his 84th birthday on 8 August 2013, escaped from prison in 1965 and spent 36 years on the run before finally being arrested and jailed in 2001.  Released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2009 due to ill health he is still alive, being cared for in a north London nursing home, and he has few regrets about the crime that made him a household name.  Biggs, who cannot speak and communicates through a spelling board, said: "If you want to ask me if I have any regrets about being one of the train robbers, my answer is, \'No!\'.  "I will go further: I am proud to have been one of them. I am equally happy to be described as the \'tea-boy\' or \'The Brain\'.  "I was there that August night and that is what counts. I am one of the few witnesses - living or dead - to what was \'The Crime of the Century\'.\'\'  But although he is proud to have been involved in the headline-grabbing crime, he admitted he does have some regrets.  "It is regrettable, as I have said many times, that the train driver was injured,\'\' he said. "And he was not the only victim.  "The people who paid the heaviest price for the Great Train Robbery are the families. The families of everyone involved in the Great Train Robbery, and from both sides of the track.  "All have paid a price for our collective involvement in the robbery. A very heavy price, in the case of my family.  "For that, I do have my regrets.\'\'  Ronnie\'s son Michael, who was born while Ronnie was on the run, spoke exclusively to Heart and said he isn\'t proud of his dad being a criminal, but he is proud of the man his dad is.  "I believe if you commit a crime, you have to do the time," he said, "but the time has to be proportional with the crime that you\'ve committed.  "The sad bit was that he went into the train robbery because he needed £500 to put a deposit on his house. About a week before the robbery, he won the £500 in a bet on the horses but there was no turning back then."

The energy for this to happen is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP . Myosin functions as an ATPase utilizing ATP to produce a molecular conformational change of part of the myosin and produces movement . Movement of the filaments over each other happens when the globular heads protruding from myosin filaments attach and interact with actin filaments to form crossbridges . The myosin heads tilt and drag along the actin filament a small distance ( 10 - 12 nm ) . The heads then release the actin filament and then changes angle to relocate to another site on the actin filament a further distance ( 10 - 12 nm ) away . They can then re-bind to the actin molecule and drag it along further . This process is called crossbridge cycling and is the same for all muscles ( see muscle contraction ) . Unlike cardiac and skeletal muscle , smooth muscle does not contain the calcium - binding protein troponin . Contraction is initiated by a calcium - regulated phosphorylation of myosin , rather than a calcium - activated troponin system . | Question: the involuntary movement of smooth muscles is called ?', ['contraction'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-11599'), ('Context: Gulf WarThe Gulf War (2 August 1990\xa0– 28 February 1991), codenamed Operation Desert Shield (2 August 1990 – 17 January 1991), for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm (17 January 1991\xa0– 28 February 1991) in its combat phase, was a war waged by coalition forces from 34 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq\'s invasion and annexation of Kuwait.  The war is also known under other names, such as the Persian Gulf War, First Gulf War, Gulf War I, Kuwait War,  First Iraq War, or Iraq War  before the term "Iraq War" became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War (also referred to in the U.S. as "Operation Iraqi Freedom").   The Iraqi Army\'s occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council. U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia, and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition, the largest military alliance since World War II. The great majority of the Coalition\'s military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.   The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the U.S. network CNN.    The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm.    The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, continuing for five weeks. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The Coalition ceased its advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia\'s border. Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel.  Terminology  The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:  *Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries. A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous, having now been applied to at least three conflicts: see Gulf War (disambiguation). The use of the term Persian Gulf (as opposed to Arabian Gulf) is also disputed: see Persian Gulf naming dispute. With no consensus of naming, various publications have attempted to refine the name. Some variants include:  **Gulf War (e.g. The Gulf War, BBC television series, 2005; Modern Conflicts: The Gulf War, Discovery Channel DVD set, 2010)  **Persian Gulf War (e.g. Encyclopedia of the Persian Gulf War, Mark Grossman, 1995; An Operational Analysis of the Persian Gulf War, U.S. Army War College, 2016)  **Gulf War (1990–1991) (e.g. The Gulf War 1991 (Essential Histories), Alastair Finlan, 2003; Gulf War, 1990-91, William Thomas Allison, 2012)  **First Gulf War (to distinguish it from the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent Iraq War) (e.g. Gulf War One: Real Voices from the Front Line, Hugh McManners, 2010)  **Second Gulf War (to distinguish it from the Iran–Iraq War) (e.g. Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State Building and Regime Security, Mohammad-Mahmoud Mohamedou, 1997)  *Liberation of Kuwait () (taḥrīr al-kuwayt) is the term used by Kuwait and most of the Coalition\'s Arab states including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.  *Other language terms include  and  (Gulf War);  (Second | Question: August 2, 1990 saw Iraq invading what country, sparking a series of events that culminated in the 1st Gulf War?', ['kuwait', 'kuw', 'state of kuwait', 'kuwaitis'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7703'), ("Context: Similarly to the original Legend of Zelda ( 1986 ) , players are given little instruction and can explore the open world freely .

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United.  History  Rotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth.  In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium.  Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.   The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.   Construction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012.  The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012.  The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3–0,  Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.  On 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time. The resulting match finished with England beating Germany 2–1. Over 9,000 fans attended the game.   The naming rights to the stadium were announced as having been bought by local company AESSEAL, in a press conference on 21 November 2014. Club chairman Tony Stewart said the deal was worth six figures annually, as a result of the deal. It was also suggested as being the biggest sponsorship deal of the club's history.   Design  The stadium has a 12,000 all-seated capacity, with the option to be able to increase the stadium's capacity if needed.  It cost approximately £20 million to construct.  The stadium includes The 1925 Club, a corporate hospitality suite.  Local businesses such as Norton Finance  and Premier Hytemp  were some of the first members.  At the beginning  of the 2014–15 season, a large video screen was installed in the north west corner of the stadium.  Stands  ;North Stand  The North Stand, known as the KCM Recycling Stand for sponsorship reasons, and often referred to as the New Tivoli, is the kop stand of the stadium. The KCM Recycling Stand holds 2000 home fans, and has the lettering of the club's initials—RUFC—in white across it. The stand sits behind one of the goals, opposite the away end.  ;West Stand  The West Stand, known as the Eric Twigg Pukka Pies Stand for sponsorship reasons, is the main stand of the stadium. It features the executive 1925 Lounge, and also the stand where the players walk under when entering the field of play. It holds 4000 home fans.  ;East Stand  The East Stand, known as the Ben Bennett Stand, is the family stand of the stadium. It holds 4000 home fans, as well as two built-in balcony-type structures for disabled people.  ;South Stand  The South Stand, known as the Morrison Stand, is a 2000 seated away stand. It sits behind a goal, with the family stand to the right, main stand to the left, and the kop directly opposite.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost.  The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. It broke ground in comedy through lampooning the establishment and political figures. Its broadcast coincided with coverage of the politically charged Profumo affair and John Profumo, the politician at the centre of the affair, became a target for derision. TW3 was first broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 1962.  Cast and writers  Cast members included cartoonist Timothy Birdsall, political commentator Bernard Levin, and actors Lance Percival, who sang topical calypsos, many improvised to suggestions from the audience, Kenneth Cope, Roy Kinnear, Willie Rushton, Al Mancini, Robert Lang,  David Kernan and Millicent Martin. The last two were also singers and the programme opened with a song\xa0– That Was The Week That Was\xa0– sung by Martin to Ron Grainer\'s theme tune and enumerating topics in the news. Frankie Howerd also guested with stand-up comedy.   Script-writers included John Albery, John Antrobus, John Betjeman, John Bird, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Richard Ingrams, Lyndon Irving, Gerald Kaufman, Frank Muir, David Nobbs, Denis Norden, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan, and Keith Waterhouse.   Programme  The programme opened with a song ("That was the week that was, It\'s over, let it go ...") sung by Millicent Martin, referring to news of the week just gone. Lance Percival sang a topical calypso each week. Satirical targets, such as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Home Secretary Henry Brooke were lampooned in sketches, debates and monologues. Other targets were the monarchy, Britain\'s declining status as a global power, racism (particularly in the American South and South Africa under Apartheid), sexual and social hypocrisy, the class system, and the BBC itself. Well-remembered sketches include a \'consumers\' guide to religion\', which discussed relative merits of faiths in the manner of a Which? magazine report.  On Saturday, 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Francis Crick, James D. Watson, and Maurice Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch with the prizes referred to as the Alfred Nobel Peace Pools; in this sketch Watson was called "Little J.D. Watson" and "Who\'d have thought he\'d ever get the Nobel Prize? Makes you think, doesn\'t it". The germ of the joke was that Watson was only 25 when he helped discover DNA; much younger than the others.  TW3 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 12 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 1963, in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of The Third Man television series after the end of TW3. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of the BBCs Director General Hugh Greene.   Frost often ended a satirical attack with the remark "But seriously, he\'s doing a grand job".  At the end of each episode, Frost usually signed off with: "That was the week, that was." At the end of the final programme he announced: "That was That Was The Week That Was...that was."

Dickens found the        writing too painful and burned what he had written. He opted instead to        work his story into the fictional account of David Copperfield.  In the novel Dickens\' painful memories of being taken from school to work        at Warren\'s Blacking Factory while his father is in prison for debt are told through David\'s account        of Murdstone and Grinby\'s warehouse. The financial troubles of the Micawbers ,        with whom David was boarding at        the time, mirror Dickens\' parents, John and Elizabeth Dickens,        financial difficulties.  When David is asked by Mrs Micawber to take some of their treasured possessions to the pawn shop to help meet        their obligations, Dickens is recalling painful memories of having to pawn        off the very books he read and treasured as a child to ease his family\'s        financial woes.  On Dickens\' death Forster wrote The        Life of Charles Dickens , which is still the definitive biography        of Dickens, although many of the more negative aspects of Dickens life are        glossed over or missing altogether. Forster\'s biography included the autobiographical        fragment Dickens had given him. This was the first the public knew of Dickens\'        difficult childhood that had so heavily shaped his early work.  Oops...  Dickens originally introduced the        character of the dwarf, Miss Mowcher ,        as an aid to Steerforth\'s plan        to elope with Emily . Mrs. Jane Seymour        Hill, Dickens\' wife Catherine\'s chiropodist, recognized herself as the original for this character and threatened        a lawsuit . Dickens changed the character, in later monthly installments        of the novel, to an honest friend who abhors Steerforth\'s actions. She later        assists in the capture of Littimer .  Like Dickens, David teaches himself        shorthand and becomes a parliamentary reporter. David laments on the difficulties        encountered mastering this art:  "I bought an approved scheme of the noble art and mystery of stenography        (which cost me ten and sixpence); and plunged into a sea of perplexity that        brought me, in a few weeks, to the confines of distraction. The changes        that were rung upon dots, which in such a position meant such a thing, and        in such another position something else, entirely different; the wonderful        vagaries that were played by circles; the unaccountable consequences that        resulted from marks like flies\' legs; the tremendous effects of a curve        in a wrong place; not only troubled my waking hours, but reappeared before        me in my sleep."  Dickens hints at his feelings for politics when David says of his parliamentary        reporting:  "Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed        fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and        foot with red tape. I am sufficiently behind the scenes to know the worth        of political life. I am quite an Infidel about it, and shall never be converted."  During the writing of David Copperfield        Dickens was actively involved in the day-to-day operation of Urania        Cottage , a home for homeless women, which he administered on behalf        of his friend, philanthropist Angela        Burdett Coutts . The home helped to separate homeless, and "fallen",        women from previous lifestyles, educate them in the execution of household        duties and self-discipline, and then help them emigrate to Australia to        begin new lives.  In David Copperfield, Dickens has several of the major characters emigrate        to Australia: the Micawbers , Mr.        Peggotty , Emily , Martha, and Mr.        Mell . Each of these characters are successful in beginning a new life        in the English colony.  Did Dickens visit the birthplace of David Copperfield?

The cysts are readily killed by heat and by freezing temperatures , and survive for only a few months outside of the host . When cysts are swallowed they cause infections by excysting ( releasing the trophozoite stage ) in the digestive tract . The pathogenic nature of E. histolytica was first reported by Lösch in 1875 , but it was not given its Latin name until Fritz Schaudinn described it in 1903 .

Symptoms can include fulminating dysentery , bloody diarrhea , weight loss , fatigue , abdominal pain , and amoeboma . The amoeba can actually ' bore ' into the intestinal wall , causing lesions and intestinal symptoms , and it may reach the blood stream .

The mountains received their name from the heavily forested slopes that appear black from afar. Native Americans, white settlers, and railroad companies depended on wood from the Black Hills for fuel and building material. Gold was discovered in the hills in 1874 by an expedition led by Gen. George Custer, and the resulting gold rush drove out the indigenous population. White settlements grew rapidly after 1876, chiefly in such mining towns in South Dakota as Custer, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, and Rapid City, the largest city in the Black Hills. Gold is still mined in the area. Other important minerals found in the hills are uranium, feldspar, mica, and silver. The Black Hills are a major recreational area of the northern plains and a principal tourist spot. Most of the slopes are in two national forests.

09/30/2021 16:04:28 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[("Context: Sheffield United F.C.Sheffield United Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The team complete in League One, the third tier of English football. The football club was formed in 1889 as an offshoot of Sheffield United Cricket Club, and are nicknamed The Blades due to Sheffield's history of steel production. The club have played their home games at Bramall Lane since their formation in 1889. Bramall Lane is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 32,609.  Sheffield United won the original First Division in 1898 and the FA Cup in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925. They were beaten finalists in the FA Cup in 1901 and 1936, and reached the semi-finals in 1961, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2014. They reached the semi-finals of the League Cup in 2003 and 2015.  For most of the club's history they have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their closest rivals are Sheffield Wednesday, with whom they contest the Steel City Derby.  History  Sheffield United formed on 22 March 1889 at the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield (now the site of the Crucible Theatre) by the President of the Cricket Club Sir Charles Clegg. The Wednesday had moved from Bramall Lane to their own ground at Olive Grove, and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.   Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in 1897–98 and runners up in 1896–97 and 1899–1900, and FA Cup winners in 1899, 1902, 1915 and 1925, finishing runners up in 1901, and also eleven years after their cup final win in 1936. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with promotion from lower-leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and Football League Cup.   Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the 1974–75 season, they were relegated to the Second Division the following season and three years after that setback they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their first season in the league's basement division and two years afterwards they won promotion to the Second Division.  They did fall back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.  They would remain outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they did qualify for the play-offs under Bassett's successor Howard Kendall in 1997 and caretaker manager Steve Thompson in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when Neil Warnock was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in 2002–03 they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the rebranded Football League Championship. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the Premier League amidst the controversy surrounding Carlos Tevez, the player who was controversially signed by West Ham United and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation. Neil Warnock resigned as manager after the Blades went down.

The second third of the smoke reveals the taste of cocoa and spice interspersed with subtle chili-like flavors. The after-taste following the last third is unusually sweet combining it with mushroom flavors. This is one of the tastiest cigars you can ever smoke.  History  Hoyo de Monterrey brand has a long history on the international market of Cuban cigars. Everything is dating since back in 1865 when Don Jose Gener y Batet established this marque of Cuban cigars after he purchased one of the most qualitative plantations of tobacco from the famous region of Cuba, Vuelta Abajo. In time, the brand imposed itself on the market, but with a higher success on the British one. There are only a few brands of Cuban cigars that can be proud of their success. The huge success of this brand was not solely because of the high quality tobacco from Vuelta Abajo, but also due to the wide variety of flavours which can be found in each line of this brand. One of the most appreciated lines created by this brand is considered to be Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure Especial. This line earned a fantastic popularity among all levels of Cuban cigars smokers.  Searching for the finest line of cigars created under the name of Hoyo de Monterrey can be a difficult task as they all are excellent.

George Rose/ Getty Images  River Phoenix, a young actor who shot to stardom after appearing in Rob Reiner\'s "Stand by Me," was near the end of filming "Dark Blood" when he died of a drug overdose on Halloween in 1993 at age 23. Phoenix had reportedly exited a Hollywood nightclub called The Viper Room when he began convulsing on the sidewalk, surrounded by onlookers. He was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . An autopsy found cocaine , morphine, marijuana, Valium and cold medication in his system [source: Mydans ].  "Dark Blood," a dark tale about a widower (Phoenix) living on a nuclear testing site , was subsequently canceled because Phoenix\'s presence was crucial to several yet-to-be-shot scenes. Phoenix was also slated to film "Interview with the Vampire" with Tom Cruise. His role was taken over by Christian Slater, who donated his entire salary from the film to a charity in Phoenix\'s honor [source: The Internet Movie Database ].  \xa0  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix - Reel ReviewsThe Untimely Death of River Phoenix  The Untimely Death of River Phoenix  by Frank Wilkins  Stand By Me  Having broken into show biz with TV\'s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers that ran during the 1982-83 season, River Phoenix would follow up with his feature-film debut as a somewhat bookworm-ish kid in Explorers (1985). But it would be the huge box-office success and eventual cult following of Stand By Me in in 1986, based on a Stephen King novella, that would launch the young actor\'s appeal into the stratosphere.  He would follow the success of that film with a turn in The Mosquito Coast (1986) in which he starred with Harrison Ford as the son of a man anxious to take his family back to a primitive life. Set in the jungles of the South Atlantic, the film\'s plot carried remarkable similarities to River Phoenix\'s atypical upbringing, having been reared in a log cabin in rural Oregon. But River accepted his rising star reluctantly, happy that he could help his family by bringing home a paycheck.  Atypical of the existing Hollywood fete set, Phoenix was shy, somewhat reclusive and held a disdain for the spotlight. The Hollywood hype machine left a bad taste in the actor\'s mouth leading him to once proclaim, "I\'ve kept my ego and my happiness completely separate from my work. in fact, if I see my face on the cover of a magazine I go into remission. I shut myself out and freak."  Hollywood Begins to Take a Toll  Following a string of appearances in such well-known films as Indiana Jones,\xa0 Sneakers and My Own Private Idaho, friends and professionals began to observe major changes in Phoenix\'s personality. He was once known for his innocence and wholesomeness. He was a very devout vegetarian, refused to wear leather clothes and jackets, and who so cared for the now diminishing rain forests in Costa Rica, he began buying up large swaths of it to protect it from encroaching development. Phoenix even once publicly denounced drugs like cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. But his typical behavior had begun to change, and people wanted to know why.  Many felt River Phoenix\'s about-face was because of a deep-seated dislike of the difficult world of Hollywood and filmmaking. Others speculated it was just his way of lashing out against the unorthodox way in which he was raised. Still others resigned themselves to the idead that Phoenix was past the point-of-no-return and would never be the same again.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.  New Prime Minister John Curtin, Treasurer Ben Chifley and Minister for Supply Jack Beasley display Australia’s latest defence acquisition, the Bren gun carrier.  NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941.

From Everybody:  "The Little Family Just Got Bigger."  Plot:  Eleanor Little (Geena Davis) and Frederick Little (Hugh Laurie) and their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) are intending an adoption. While George is at school, his parents go to an orphanage where they meet and fall in love with a humanoid mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Despite misgivings from Mrs. Keeper (Julia Sweeney), they adopt Stuart and take him home. However, Stuart is greeted coldly by George, who refuses to acknowledge the mouse as his brother, and the family cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane), who is disgusted at having a mouse for a "master". Despite Eleanor and Frederick\'s intentions, Stuart quickly feels like an outsider in the large Little family, especially when the family\'s unknowing relatives bring Stuart large presents and George snaps at his family, claiming out loud that Stuart is not his brother. When Stuart admits his feelings of loneliness to his parents, they ask Mrs. Keeper to do some background research on Stuart\'s biological family.After accidentally stumbling across George\'s playroom in the basement, Stuart finally bonds with George when they play together and plan to finish George\'s remote controlled boat, the Wasp, for an upcoming boat race in Central Park. At the same time, however, one of Snowbell\'s alley cat friends, Monty (voiced by Steve Zahn) visits unexpectedly and discovers Stuart. Determined not to have his reputation destroyed, Snowbell meets with Monty\'s leader, Smokey (voiced by Chazz Palminteri), a mafia don-like alley cat, and plans to have Stuart removed from the household without harming him.Stuart and George finish the Wasp in time for the race, but on the day of the race, the control is smashed when a bystander accidentally steps on it. Stuart pilots the Wasp himself, but ends up in a tussle with a larger boat belonging to George\'s rival, Anton, who has already smashed the rest of the boats without being disqualified. Stuart snaps the wires of Anton\'s boat and manages to win the race, at the same time finally winning George\'s acceptance and respect. During the family celebration, however, the Little\'s are visited by a mouse couple, Reginald and Camille Stout (voiced by Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly), who claim to be Stuart\'s parents who gave him up to the orphanage years ago due to poverty. Reluctantly, Stuart leaves with the Stouts, George presenting him with his toy car as a farewell gift. A few days later, however, Mrs. Keeper comes to visit and tells the Little\'s that Stuart\'s parents actually died many years ago in a supermarket accident. Realizing their son has been kidnapped, the Little\'s call the police and stick posters of Stuart\'s face across the city.Meanwhile, Snowbell meets with Smokey and the alley cats: he had actually conspired with them to have the Stouts pose as Stuart\'s parents in order to remove Stuart from the household. Fearing retribution should the Little\'s discover Snowbell\'s deception, Smokey orders the Stouts to hand Stuart over to them, but the Stouts, having grown to truly love Stuart, tell him to flee. Smokey subsequently orders a manhunt for Stuart. They corner him in Central Park and a chase ensues. Despite losing his car and almost falling down a storm drain, Stuart manages to evade Smokey and return home, unfortunately, while the Little\'s are out putting posters up. The only one present is Snowbell, who lies that the Little\'s have been enjoying themselves greatly since Stuart\'s departure, and uses Stuart\'s removed face from the family photograph as proof (which they had actually used for the posters).

Early life and education  Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, the son of Eugene Ezra Hackman and Anna Lyda Elizabeth (née Gray).  He has one brother, Richard. He has Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry; his mother was born in Lambton, Ontario.   According to a plaque in a city park, he worked for a time as a dog catcher for the local animal shelter. His family moved frequently, finally settling in Danville, Illinois, where they lived in the house of his English-born maternal grandmother, Beatrice. Hackman\'s father operated the printing press for the Commercial-News, a local paper.  As a teenager, Hackman knew Dick Van Dyke, who was friends with his older brother Richard. His parents divorced in 1943 and his father subsequently left the family.  Hackman lived briefly in Storm Lake, Iowa and spent his sophomore year at Storm Lake High School.  However, he left home at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He served four and a half years as a field radio operator.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2001 He was stationed in China (Qingdao, and later in Shanghai). When the Communist Revolution conquered the mainland in 1949, Hackman was assigned to Hawaii and Japan. Following his discharge, he moved to New York and worked in several jobs. His mother died in 1962 as a result of a fire she accidentally set while smoking.   Career   1960s   In 1956, he began pursuing an acting career; he joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was there that he forged a friendship with another aspiring actor, Dustin Hoffman. Already seen as outsiders by their classmates, they were later voted "The Least Likely To Succeed." Determined to prove them wrong, Hackman moved to New York City. A 2004 article in Vanity Fair described how Hackman, Hoffman and Robert Duvall were all struggling California born actors and close friends, sharing apartments in various two-person combinations while living in New York City in the 1960s.   To support himself between acting jobs, he was working as a uniformed doorman at a Howard Johnson restaurant in New York when, as bad luck would have it, he ran into a despised Pasadena Playhouse instructor who once told him he was not good enough to be an actor. Reinforcing "The Least Likely To Succeed" vote, the man said to him, "See, Hackman, I told you you wouldn\'t amount to anything." From then on, Hackman was determined to become the finest actor he possibly could. The three former roommates have since earned 19 Academy Award nominations for acting, with five wins.

Brisbane\'s metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, ERP at 30 June 2014. and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about 15 km from its mouth at Moreton Bay.  The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia\'s most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite.  One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is located – which in turn was named after Scotsman Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales from 1821 to 1825 – the area was chosen as a place for secondary offenders from the Sydney Colony. A penal settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 km north of the central business district, but was soon abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free settlement in 1842. The city was marred by the Australian frontier wars between 1843 and 1855, and development was partly set back by the Great Fire of Brisbane, and the Great Brisbane Flood. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur.   Today, Brisbane is well known for its distinct Queenslander architecture which forms much of the city\'s built heritage. It also receives attention for its damaging flood events, most notably in 1974 and 2011. The city is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway for visitors to the state of Queensland, particularly to the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, popular resort towns immediately south and north of Brisbane, respectively. Several large cultural, international and sporting events have been held at Brisbane, including the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo \'88, the final Goodwill Games in 2001, and the 2014 G-20 summit.  History  Nineteenth century  Prior to European settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera people.  They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike".  The Moreton Bay area was initially explored by Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point, which he named "Red Cliff Point" after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay.  In 1823 Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay.   Oxley discovered, named, and explored the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, 20 km upstream from the Brisbane central business district. Oxley recommended Red Cliff Point for the new colony, reporting that ships could land at any tide and easily get close to the shore.  The party settled in Redcliffe on 13\xa0September 1824, under the command of Lieutenant Henry Miller with 14 soldiers (some with wives and children) and 29 convicts. However, this settlement was abandoned after a year and the colony was moved to a site on the Brisbane River now known as North Quay, 28 km south, which offered a more reliable water supply. Sir Thomas Brisbane visited the settlement and travelled 28 miles up the Brisbane River in December 1824, bestowing upon Brisbane the distinction of being the only Australian capital city set foot upon by its namesake.  Chief Justice Forbes gave the new settlement the name of Edenglassie before it was named Brisbane.  Non-convict European settlement of the Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

Alcohols , for example , all have the subunit C-O-H . All alcohols tend to be somewhat hydrophilic , usually form esters , and usually can be converted to the corresponding halides .

Meanwhile , the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharial Nehru . Decolonisation was never a major election issue ; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945 . With violence escalating in India after the war , but with British financial power at a low ebb , large - scale military involvement was impossible . The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed . None were available , so political restructuring was accelerated . The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947 . Historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a `` national humiliation '' but it was necessitated by urgent financial , administrative , strategic and political needs . Whereas Churchill in 1940 - 45 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership , Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia . Many of the Congress leaders in India had studied in England , and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders . Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonization . Attlee found that Churchill 's viceroy , Field Marshal Wavell , was too imperialistic , too keen on military solutions ( he wanted seven more Army divisions ) and too neglectful of Indian political alignments . The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten , the dashing war hero and a cousin of the King .

May 7th 2016  Nearly everyone has some kind of fear, and some fears are more common than others. Sometimes these fears are rooted in actual experiences and other times they are not. Even having multiple phobias is quite common. These are just some of the most common phobias, but there are much more that have been documented.  1. Arachnophobia  Arachnophobia is the fear of spiders. Many people who share this fear are typically affected by a childhood memory, or are just frightened by the appearance. Even the thought of one crawling on their skin can make them shudder in fear. In the dark ages, spiders were thought to harbor the bubonic plague and were seen as a source of food and water contamination, leading to a widespread fear of spiders.  2. Ophidiophobia  Ophidiophobia is a fear of snakes. Some experts believe that the fear of snakes may be an innate survival mechanism to protect people from poisonous reptiles, though others argue that if this was the case, this phobia wouldn\'t be as common as it is. This phobia can cause people to avoid places like zoos or pet stores.  3. Acrophobia  Acrophobia is a fear of heights. Unlike a lot of fears, this fear can manifest into other fears, such as a fear of flying or roller coasters. This fear can vary in severity as well. Some may avoid things like climbing ladders, while others may not be able to ride in an elevator or go to a high floor in a building.  4. Necrophobia  Necrophobia is the fear of death or dead things. This is a very common fear, especially after the loss of a loved one. This fear is a sort of defense mechanism of the mind. This can also be a very difficult phobia to overcome because of the uncertainty surrounding death and the large faith component associated with death and dying.  5. Cynophobia  Cynophobia is the fear of dogs, and is often the result of a traumatic experience. For example, someone bitten by a dog as an infant may have a fear of dogs into adulthood without knowing why. This phobia can cause people to avoid dog-owning friends or relatives.  6. Claustrophobia  Most people know that claustrophobia is the fear of confined spaces. This fear can manifest after a traumatic experience, such as being stuck in an elevator, though this is not always the case. Claustrophobia can vary in severity and is known to run in families.  7. Coulrophobia  Coulrophobia is the fear of clowns. Many people develop this fear as children, though this isn\'t always the case. Clowns are often portrayed in media as bad, such as in the move "It", or in real life as was the case with serial killer John Wayne Gacy who dressed up like a clown. This can trigger a phobia in some people.  8. Pediophobia  This is the phobia of dolls. Dolls were originally created as vessels for the dead, and this seems to be the root of many fears, particularly that the dolls could cause harm to the person with the phobia. One high profile case of pediophobia is that of Zak Bagans from the television show "Ghost Adventures." Bagans\' phobia is so intense that he cannon touch a doll or toy clown.  9. Hemophobia  This is the fear of blood. Some people experience feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness and occasionally faint at the sight of blood, even when it is something as small as a cut. The origins of this fear are unclear, but it may be related to a fear of death.  10. Glossaphobia  This is one phobia that many people struggle to overcome. Glossaphobia is the fear of public speaking. This phobia can manifest in childhood, and it\'s estimated that up to 75 percent of people have this fear to some degree.  11. Nyctophobia  This is one of the most common childhood fears, the fear of the darkness.

There are ten numbercodedspecimens measuringapproximately 1 x 1 1/2 inches(except the diamond, dont you wish!). The determination of the hardness of a mineral can be an important step toward its identification. Hardness is the resistance which the smooth surfof a mineral offers to being scratched. A diamond is the hardest of all substances and can only be scratched by another diamond. Over a century ago, Friedrich Mohs by experimentation made up a scale of hardness which is referred to as Mohs scale. It does not imply an exact hardness, but is set up so that any mineral can scratch all those beneath it in the scale, or can be scratched by those above it in the scale. Since a diamond is the hardest it is given the number 10; talc is the softest so it is given number 1. Quartz is often used as a division in the scale and all those above 7 are called hard minerals. Here are the samples included in the set and their number on the scale of hardness: 1 Talc 6 Feldspar 2 Gypsum 7 Quartz 3 Calcite 8 Beryl 4 Fluorite 9 Corundum 5 Apatite 10 Diamond Some very familiar objects can be used in conjunction with this scale. A fingernail has the hardness of 2. 5, a copper coin between 3 and 4, a nail about 5, common window glass 5. 5, a steel file or porcelain tile 6. 5. Other minerals are sometimes substituted in the scale such as topaz for beryl since they both have a hardness of 8. Scale of hardness with diamond is recommended for grades 6 to 12.

The hardness of a mineral largely determines its durability and is related also to the strength and toughness of solid substances. It is important not to confuse hardness of a material with strength. Many hard materials (such as diamonds) are brittle and will break easily if they are struck. However, in common usage the term 'hardness' is often extended to include strength and toughness.  Strength of Materials  A full discussion of the strength of materials is beyond the scope of this Entry. Suffice it to say that there are different types of strength:  Types of strength  Bending  When it is bent.  Hence, in simple terms, the strength of a material is a measure of its resistance to various forms of deformation.  Hardness  The relative hardness of minerals is determined according to Mohs Scale, named after the German mineralogist, Friedrich Mohs , who devised it in 1812. In the original Mohs Scale, ten minerals were arranged in order of increasing hardness and were assigned the numbers one to ten.

A major factor in this rejection of the tradition of Mosaic authorship was the development of the documentary hypothesis , which understood the Pentateuch as a composite work made up of four `` sources , '' or documents , compiled over centuries in a process that was not concluded until long after Moses ' death . The documentary hypothesis aroused understandable opposition from traditional scholars . One of the most significant was David Zvi Hoffmann ( 1843 - 1921 ) , who attempted to defend Mosaic authorship by demonstrating that the sources identified by the documentary hypothesis were , in fact , pre-exilic ; if this were proven , he believed , then the hypothesis itself was dis - proven . The most he would concede to the proponents of the hypothesis was that Moses may have written various scrolls over his career and that these may have been collated and united before his death . Another important Jewish scholar , and one still active , is David Weiss Halivni ( b. 1927 ) : he has developed a theory of Chate'u Yisrael , literally , `` Israel has sinned '' , which states that the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours and neglected the Torah of Moses , with the result that it became `` blemished and maculated ; '' only on the return from Babylon did the people once again accept the Torah , which was then recompiled and edited by Ezra as evidenced in Ezra -- Nehemiah and Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah . He further states that while the text of the Torah was corrupted , oral tradition was preserved intact , which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details . Menachem Mendel Kasher ( 1895 - 1983 ) , taking a different approach , accepted the documentary hypothesis but adapted it to the Mosaic tradition , pointing to certain traditions of the Oral Torah which show Moses quoting Genesis prior to the epiphany at Sinai ; based on a number of Bible verses and rabbinic statements , he therefore suggested that Moses made use of documents authored by the Patriarchs when redacting that book .

When laid onto its side , the growing parts of the stem begin to display negative gravitropism , growing ( biologists say , turning ; see tropism ) upwards . Hebaverns ( non-woody ) stems are capable of a small degree of actual bending , but most of the redirected movement occurs as a consequence of root or stem growth outside . | Question: growth of a plant shoot away from gravity ?', ['Gravitropism ( also known as geotropism )'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-train-32091'), ("Context: `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' is a song by American recording artist Sam Cooke .

Stanley also worked on engineering and adapting European designs such as the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for US entrepreneur George Westinghouse who started building AC systems in 1886 . The spread of Westinghouse and other AC systems triggered a push back in late 1887 by Edison ( a proponent of direct current ) who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the `` War of Currents '' . In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional AC motor , something these systems had lacked up till then . The design , an induction motor , was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla ( with Tesla 's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US ) .

She is an only child . Evie attends a school for gifted children ( run by her mother ) and achieves good grades there . Her mother had always told Evie that her father was a secret agent , but on her thirteenth birthday Evie began to develop superhuman abilities and it was revealed that her father is an extraterrestrial from the planet Antareus . Evie 's main power is the ability to freeze time on Earth by touching the tips of her index fingers together , allowing her to maneuver herself or objects to alter the course of events on Earth . When she claps her hands together , time resumes as normal . She can also `` unfreeze '' individuals by touching them while time is frozen . She later gains the power to gleep , which allows her to manifest objects by using the power of her mind . Her father describes her as `` the perfect child : loving ; caring ; with the same needs of most teenagers '' . The series follows Evie through her teenage years , from her thirteenth birthday in the first episode to her eighteenth birthday in the final episode .

Troy is a human - looking extraterrestrial , with many special powers , from the planet Antareus . Troy met Donna when his spacecraft crashed on Earth at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s . The two fell in love , were married in 1971 , and two years later Donna gave birth to Evie . Shortly after , in 1974 , Troy was called back to Antareus to fight in a war . Since then , Troy occasionally visits Earth , and stays in touch with his daughter via a special communication device known as the `` cube '' ( see below ) . Troy 's powers seem to be almost limitless : though he lives on Antareus , he can control many things on Earth ( from computers to the weather ) ; he can give and take away Evie 's powers at will ; and also seems to be aware of certain events on Earth . While Troy appears in the show 's opening credits , he rarely makes a physical appearance in the series -- and when he does his face is obscured ( for example , via a surgical mask or shadows ) . In the series finale , when Troy arrives on Earth , he is seen in a silhouette with stars from the galaxy . Troy was credited as `` himself '' in the opening credits from Season Two onwards .   Beano Froelich ( 1987 -- 1990 ) ( Joe Alaskey ) -- `` Uncle Beano '' is Donna 's brother and Evie 's uncle , who lives next door to them .

It has been characterized as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer. The United Methodist Church believes in prima scriptura, seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred tradition, reason, and experience to interpret it, with the aid of the Holy Spirit (see Wesleyan Quadrilateral). Therefore, according to The Book of Discipline, United Methodist theology is at once "catholic, evangelical, and reformed." Today, the UMC is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race, gender, and ideology, though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes. Comparatively, the UMC stands to the right of liberal and progressive Protestant groups such as the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church on certain issues (especially regarding sexuality), but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the Southern Baptists and Pentecostalism, in regard to theological matters such as social justice and Biblical interpretation. However, it should be noted that the UMC is made up of a broad diversity of thought, and so there are many clergy and laity within the UMC that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters. | Question: Today, which church is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations?', ['UMC', 'the UMC'], 'mrqa_squad-validation-10036'), ('Context: An axon ( from Greek ἄξων áxōn , axis ) or nerve fiber , is a long , slender projection of a nerve cell , or neuron , that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials , away from the nerve cell body .

This is a translation of the Latin phrase dies Solis . English , like most of the Germanic languages , preserves the original pagan / sun associations of the day . Many other European languages , including all of the Romance languages , have changed its name to the equivalent of `` the Lord 's day '' ( based on Ecclesiastical Latin dies Dominica ) . In both West Germanic and North Germanic mythology the Sun is personified as Sunna / Sól .   Monday : Old English Mōnandæg ( pronounced ( ˈmoːnɑndæj ) ) , meaning `` Moon 's day '' . This is equivalent to the Latin name dies lunae . In North Germanic mythology , the Moon is personified as Máni .   Tuesday : Old English Tīwesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈtiːwezdæj ) ) , meaning `` Tiw 's day '' . Tiw ( Norse Týr ) was a one - handed god associated with single combat and pledges in Norse mythology and also attested prominently in wider Germanic paganism . The name of the day is also related to the Latin name dies Martis , `` Day of Mars '' .   Wednesday : Old English Wōdnesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈwoːdnezdæj ) ) meaning the day of the Germanic god Woden ( known as Óðinn among the North Germanic peoples ) , and a prominent god of the Anglo - Saxons ( and other Germanic peoples ) in England until about the seventh century . It is also vaguely related to the Latin counterpartdies Mercurii , `` Day of Mercury '' . The connection between Mercury and Odin is more strained than the other syncretic connections . The usual explanation is that both Wodan and Mercury were considered psychopomps , or guides of souls after death , in their respective mythologies ; both are also associated with poetic and musical inspiration . The Icelandic Miðviku , German Mittwoch , Low German Middeweek and Finnish keskiviikko all mean mid-week .   Thursday : Old English Þūnresdæg ( pronounced ( ˈθuːnrezdæj ) ) , meaning ' Þunor 's day ' . Þunor means thunder or its personification , the Norse god known in Modern English as Thor . Similarly Dutch donderdag , German Donnerstag ( ' thunder 's day ' ) , Finnish torstai , and Scandinavian Torsdag ( ' Thor 's day ' ) . Thor 's day corresponds to Latin dies Iovis , `` day of Jupiter '' .   Friday : Old English Frīgedæg ( pronounced ( ˈfriːjedæj ) ) , meaning the day of the Anglo - Saxon goddess Fríge . The Norse name for the planet Venus was Friggjarstjarna , ' Frigg 's star ' . It is based on the Latin dies Veneris , `` Day of Venus '' .   Saturday : the only day of the week to retain its Roman origin in English , named after the Roman god Saturn associated with the Titan Cronus , father of Zeus and many Olympians . Its original Anglo - Saxon rendering was Sæturnesdæg ( pronounced ( ˈsæturnezdæj ) ) . In Latin , it was dies Saturni , `` Day of Saturn '' . The Scandinavian Lørdag / Lördag deviates significantly as it has no reference to either the Norse or the Roman pantheon ; it derives from old Norse laugardagr , literally `` washing - day '' .

She was India's first and, to date, only female Prime Minister. In 1999, she was voted the greatest woman of the past 1000 years in a poll carried by BBC news, ahead of other notable women such as Queen Elizabeth I of England, Marie Curie and Mother Teresa. Born in the politically influential Nehru dynasty, she grew up in an intensely political atmosphere. Despite the same last name, she was of no relation to the statesman Mohandas Gandhi. Her grandfather, Motilal Nehru, was a prominent Indian nationalist leader. Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a pivotal figure in the Indian independence movement and the first Prime Minister of Independent India. Returning to India from Oxford in 1941, she became involved in the Indian Independence movement. In the 1950s, she served her father unofficially as a personal assistant during his tenure as the first Prime Minister of India. After her father's death in 1964, she was appointed as a member of the Rajya Sabha by the President of India and became a member of Lal Bahadur Shastri's cabinet as Minister of Information and Broadcasting. The then Congress Party President K. Kamaraj was instrumental in making Indira Gandhi the Prime Minister after the sudden demise of Shastri. Gandhi soon showed an ability to win elections and outmaneuver opponents through populism. She introduced more left-wing economic policies and promoted agricultural productivity. A decisive victory in the 1971 war with Pakistan was followed by a period of instability that led her to impose a state of emergency in 1975; she paid for the authoritarian excesses of the period with three years in opposition. Returned to office in 1980, she became increasingly involved in an escalating conflict with separatists in Punjab that eventually led to her assassination by her own bodyguards in 1984.

Gandhi is distinguished for both the work she did while in office, and as a figure of female strength and agency in the political field. Indira Gandhi was elected to the position of Prime Minister of the Republic of India on four separate occasions. She served three consecutive terms from 1966 to 1977. She was later elected for a fourth term in 1980, which she served until her assassination on 31 October 1984.  Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi was born on 19 November 1917. The daughter of prominent Indian political figure Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi seemed destined for life in the political field. During her childhood, Indira Gandhi and her family were visited by the hugely influential Mahatma Gandhi, under whose leadership her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, participated in the Indian Independence Movement. She would later join in the movement as well.  During the time of her education at the University of Oxford, England, Indira Gandhi participated in political activism, including the pro-independence movement called the India League. In 1941, she married activist Feroze Gandhi, with whom she later had two children.  In 1947, she assisted in organizing refugee camps for Pakistani refugees during the Partition of India. This was, perhaps, her first substantial act of public service.

His achievements as Prime Minister were shaped by the war. In a remarkable move, Curtin put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of the Australia’s defence forces in the Pacific. He also rejected Britain’s strategy for deploying Australian troops, enabling the successful defence of New Guinea. Although Curtin had been a strong opponent of conscription during World War I, as Prime Minister during World War II he made the decision to send conscripted troops to serve outside Australia, but not outside the Australian region.

NAA: M1409, 13, p. 2  Curtin inherited a finely balanced parliament. Neither Governor-General Lord Gowrie , nor his fellow parliamentarians believed Curtin would remain Prime Minister for long. Not only was his majority precarious, but Curtin had appeared reluctant to take power in his cooperation with the wartime Coalition government.  Curtin did have doubts about his ability to lead a nation at war, and about assuming power without a clear mandate for Labor. With neither the United Australia Party nor the Country Party able to govern, Curtin became Prime Minister by default rather than choice.  Curtin surprised his colleagues and the Opposition. He proved, like Alfred Deakin , ‘a patient and resourceful parliamentary tactician’ in an evenly divided parliament. He also rapidly emerged as a strong and decisive chairman of Cabinet and head of government. He drew out a nationwide war effort, and put in place the measures for postwar reconstruction.  Cabinet  When the Curtin ministry was sworn in on 7 October 1941, the first Labor government in a decade took office. Of the 19 ministers, only four had portfolio experience, Frank Forde , Ben Chifley , Jack Beasley and Jack Holloway . HV Evatt was Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs. Ben Chifley was Treasurer with Hubert Lazzarini as minister assisting. The portfolios of Social Services and Health were allocated to Jack Holloway, Trade and Customs to Senator Richard Keane , Commerce to William Scully , Postmaster-General to Senator William Ashley , Transport to George Lawson , External Territories to Senator James Fraser , Interior to Senator Joseph Collings and CSIRO to Jack Dedman . Fifteen portfolios were directly concerned with the war: Defence Coordination (Curtin); Army (Frank Forde); Navy, and also Munitions ( Norman Makin ); Air, and also Civil Aviation ( Arthur Drakeford ); Aircraft Production (Senator Donald Cameron ); Supply and Development (Jack Beasley); War Organisation and Industry (Jack Dedman); Labour and National Service ( Eddie Ward ); Information (Senator William Ashley ); Home Security (Hubert Lazzarini); Postwar Reconstruction (Ben Chifley); War Service Homes, and Repatriation ( Charles Frost ).  Journalist Alan Reid reported Curtin’s determination ‘to make each and every Minister accept in the Cabinet room the responsibility for any action by the Department he represents’. A lot of homework was required for each new minister to ‘know as much about the broad policy of his department as the permanent head and much of the detail’, as Curtin directed.  Though Frank Forde was deputy Prime Minister, Curtin developed a close friendship with Ben Chifley. He also drew on the counsel of James Scullin , whose office in Parliament House was between Curtin’s and Chifley’s.  Preparing for a Pacific war  Both the people and the parliament were looking for a Prime Minister who could draw out Australia’s maximum war effort. Two prime ministers had already lost power in the finely balanced 16th parliament during 1941. And as Australia faced the increasing possibility of Japan going to war in the Pacific, anxiety about defence readiness became widespread. British war strategy had most of Australia’s best forces committed to the Middle East.

Shintoism - Queensborough Community CollegeShintoism  In       the late 6th century  AD  the name Shinto was created for the       native religion to distinguish it from Buddhism and Confucianism, which       had been introduced from China. Shinto was rapidly overshadowed by       Buddhism, and the native gods were generally regarded as manifestations of       Buddha in a previous state of existence. Buddhist priests became the       custodians of Shinto shrines and introduced their own ornaments, images,       and ritual. At the end of the 8th and the beginning of the 9th centuries,       the celebrated Japanese teacher Kukai, or (posthumously) Kobo Daishi,       established a doctrine uniting Buddhism and Shinto under the name of Ryobu       Shinto (Japanese, "the Shinto of two kinds"). In the new       religion, Buddhism dominated Shinto, and elements were adopted from       Confucianism. The ancient practice of Shinto proper virtually disappeared       and was maintained only at a few great shrines and in the imperial palace,       although the emperors themselves had become Buddhists. The distinctively       Shinto priests became fortune-tellers and magicians.  Beginning       in the 18th century, Shinto was revived as an important national religion       through the writings and teachings of a succession of notable scholars,       including Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga, and Hirata Atsutane. Motivated by       nationalistic sentiments that took the form of reverence for Japanese       antiquity and hatred for ideas and practices of foreign origin, these men       prepared the way for the disestablishment of Buddhism and the adoption of       Shinto as the state religion. In 1867 the shogunate was overthrown, and       the emperor was restored to the head of the government. According to       revived Shinto doctrine, the sovereignty of the emperor was exercised by       divine right through his reputed descent from the sun goddess Amaterasu       Omikami, who is considered the founder of the Japanese nation. Related       beliefs included the doctrines that the Japanese were superior to other       peoples because of their descent from the gods, and that the emperor was       destined to rule over the entire world. Until the defeat of Japan in World       War II, these beliefs were of the utmost importance in assuring popular       support for the military expansion of the Japanese Empire.  III.       Contemporary Shinto  Before       1946 Shinto took two forms: State, or Shrine, Shinto, a patriotic       nationalistic cult, identified with and financially supported by the       imperial Government; and Sectarian Shinto, a general term for a number of       sects founded by private persons and based on various interpretations of       traditional Shinto. State Shinto, as the official government cult,       theoretically embodied the religious beliefs of the entire Japanese       people, and the number of its adherents was counted as the total       population of the empire. The cult centered on a great profusion of       shrines in all parts of the country, ranging from small wayside chapels       commemorating local spirits and families to great national sanctuaries,       such as the Yasukuni Shrine, Tokyo, dedicated to the spirits of soldiers       who had died in battle for Japan. In 1946, during the American occupation       of Japan following World War II, the cult was completely separated from       the state by order of General Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander for the       Allied powers. Government financial support of State Shinto was       eliminated, the former practice of teaching cult doctrines in the schools       was abolished, and the use of Shinto symbols for nationalistic purposes       was forbidden. At the same time the emperor issued a statement renouncing       all claims to divinity.  Sectarian       Shinto, a religion of the same status as Buddhism and Christianity, was       unaffected by these changes. At the present time it comprises 13 major and       numerous minor sects. The principal sects are divided into 5 main groups:       those that continue with little modification the traditions of ancient       Shinto; those that emphasize adherence to Confucian ethics; those that are       predominantly devoted to faith healing; those that practice the worship of       mountains; and those that are primarily devoted to purification rites. In       the early 1990s more than 110 million Japanese participated in the various       Shinto sects, but those | Question: In what country is the religion of Shinto commonly practiced?', ['japan'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3714'), ('Context: Switzerland ( / ˈswɪtsərlənd / ) , officially the Swiss Confederation , is a sovereign state in Europe .

READ MORE: Stargazers witness rare event in supermoon eclipse  Many space experts believe that the finding could be related to the discovery of flowing water on the planet\'s surface after noticing that some of the participants in the news conference are authors on a paper on the same topic scheduled to be delivered this week.  Researchers already know that frozen water exists on Mars in the form of ice caps, but the discovery of liquid flowing water would have much more significant meaning.

He was England's first £1 million player.  Between 1988 and 2003 he was a football manager, most notably with Sheffield Wednesday and then Birmingham City. Francis is currently working as a pundit with BT Sport.   Education and playing career  Francis was born in Plymouth and educated at Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys. He was an agile and skilful forward and joined Birmingham City as a schoolboy. He quickly rose in status, making his debut for its first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against Bolton Wanderers.  He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.  Birmingham City  In the 1970s, Birmingham City reached the occasional domestic semi-final but failed to make a great impact in the First Division championship, so the ability and achievements of Francis were made more noticeable as a result.  On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside four Queens Park Rangers defenders, constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a 25-yard shot which caught the goalkeeper off guard. In 1977, he was given his first England cap by Don Revie. England were beaten 2–0 by the Netherlands.  Detroit Express (NASL)  Francis negotiated a secondment from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League (NASL), where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named to the NASL first XI alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia before returning home to the Midlands. However, in February 1979 came the moment which would define his career and leave his name permanently in football folklore.  Nottingham Forest  Nottingham Forest, the reigning First Division champions and League Cup holders managed by Brian Clough, put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1 million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play squash—Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a racquet as he addressed the press conference.    While recognised as the first million pound player,  the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. There is a myth that the fee was £999,999—£1 short of the million mark—as Brian Clough wanted to ensure this milestone did not go to the player's head, although Trevor Francis says it was a tongue-in-cheek remark by Brian Clough.   With taxes, the total fee exceeded £1.1m.   Nottingham Forest retained the League Cup shortly afterwards (though Francis was ineligible), and made progress in the European Cup to the extent that they reached the semi-finals, at which point Francis was permitted by registration rules to take part. They won their semi-final, and in May 1979 Forest took on Swedish side Malmö in the final in Munich, and a major instalment of the huge investment money was repaid just before half time.  The ball was spread to Forest's lugubrious but skilful winger John Robertson wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging cross towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even he had to increase his pace to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net. Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to Match of the Day for some years afterwards.

In 1542, while just six days old, Mary ascended to the Scottish throne upon the death of her father, King James V. Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis’ death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the country’s monarch.  In 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeth’s death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o’ Field, and Mary’s lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.  In 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.  On February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother’s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Who was Mary Queen of Scots?  Mary was known as Queen of Scots because she was Queen of Scotland. For a short time she was also Queen of France. She might have become Queen of England too. Mary's life was full of romance but sadness too. She became famous across Europe, especially after her execution in 1587, for plotting (it was said) against England's Queen Elizabeth I.  When did she live?  Mary was born in 1542, when Henry VIII was King of England. Her father was King James V of Scotland. Mary became Queen of Scotland as a baby. She was Queen until 1567, when she gave up the crown and left Scotland. She spent many years a prisoner in England, where she was put to death on 8 February 1587.  A sad life  Mary never knew her father, who died soon after her birth. As a little girl, she was sent away from her mother to France. Her first husband died two years after their wedding. Her second husband was murdered. Her third husband ran off with her, then deserted her. The Scots rejected her, and the English locked her up. Mary Queen of Scots' sad life ended when she was beheaded in 1587.  Princess in Scotland  Where was Mary born?  Mary was born at Linlithgow Palace in Scotland on 8 December 1542. Mary's father was King James V of Scotland. Mary's mother, Mary of Guise, was French. Mary was related to the English king, Henry VIII, through her English grandmother, a member of the Tudor family.

Published on Jan 2, 2009  One  wonderful  waltz  of   Johann Strauss  Johann Strauss II (October 25, 1825 -- June 3, 1899; also known as fully Johann Baptist Strauss, and Johann Strauss, Jr. was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.  Strauss was born in St. Ulrich (now a part of Neubau), the son of Johann Strauss I, another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a banker; however, the son defied his father\'s wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the violin with Anton Kollmann, the ballet répétiteur of the Vienna Court Opera. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.  Some of Johann Strauss\'s most famous works include The Blue Danube, Vienna Waltz, Kaiser-Walzer, Tales from the Vienna Woods, the Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka, and the Pizzicato Polka. Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the most well-known.

Did Davy Crockett Die in Battle at the Alamo?  Updated March 05, 2016.  Did Davy Crockett Die in Battle at the Alamo?:  On March 6, 1836, Mexican forces stormed the Alamo, a fortress-like old mission in San Antonio where some 200 rebellious Texans had been holed up for weeks. The battle was over in less than two hours, leaving great Texas heroes like Jim Bowie, James Butler Bonham and William Travis dead. Among the defenders that day was Davy Crockett, former Congressman and legendary hunter, scout and teller of tall-tales. According to some accounts, Crockett died in battle and according to others, he was one of a handful of men captured and later executed. What really happened?  Davy Crockett:  Davy Crockett (1786-1836) was born in Tennessee, then a frontier territory. He was a hard working young man who distinguished himself as a scout in the Creek War and provided food for his whole regiment by hunting. Initially a supporter of Andrew Jackson , he was elected to Congress in 1827. He fell out with Jackson, however, and in 1835 lost his seat in Congress.  continue reading below our video  10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don\'t Know  By this time, Crockett was famous for his tall tales and folksy speeches. He felt it was time to take a break from politics and decided to visit Texas.  Crockett Arrives at the Alamo:  Crockett made his way slowly to Texas. Along the way, he learned that there was much sympathy for the Texans in the USA. Many men were heading there to fight and people assumed Crockett was, too: he didn\'t contradict them. He crossed into Texas in early 1836. Learning that the fighting was taking place near San Antonio , he headed there. He arrived at the Alamo in February. By then, Rebel leaders such as Jim Bowie and William Travis were preparing a defense. Bowie and Travis did not get along: Crockett, ever the skilled politician, defused the tension between them.  Crockett at the Battle of the Alamo:  Crockett had arrived with a handful of volunteers from Tennessee. These frontiersmen were lethal with their long rifles and they were a welcome addition to the defenders. The Mexican army arrived in late February and laid siege to the Alamo. Mexican General Santa Anna did not immediately seal the exits from San Antonio and the defenders could have escaped had they wished: they chose to remain. The Mexicans attacked at dawn on March 6 and within two hours the Alamo was overrun .  Was Crockett taken Prisoner?:  Here’s where things get unclear. Historians agree on a few basic facts: some 600 Mexicans and 200 Texans died that day. A handful – most say seven – of Texan defenders were taken alive. These men were swiftly put to death by orders of Mexican General Santa Anna. According to some sources, Crockett was among them, and according to others, he was not. What’s the truth? There are several sources that should be considered.  Fernando Urissa:  The Mexicans were crushed at the Battle of San Jacinto about six weeks later. One of the Mexican\xa0 prisoners was a young officer named Fernando Urissa. Urissa was wounded, and treated by Dr. Nicholas Labadie, who kept a journal. Labadie asked about the Battle of the Alamo, and Urissa mentioned the capture of a "venerable-looking man" with a red face: he believed the others called him "Coket." The prisoner was brought to Santa Anna and then executed, shot by several soldiers at once.  Francisco Antonio Ruiz:  Francisco Antonio Ruiz, the mayor of San Antonio, was safely behind the Mexican lines when the battle began and had a good vantage point to witness what happened. Before the arrival of the Mexican army, he had met Crockett, as the civilians of San Antonio and the defenders of the Alamo mingled freely. He said that after the battle Santa Anna ordered him to point out the bodies of Crockett, | Question: During which battle did Davey Crockett lose his life?', ['alamo'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7332'), ('Context: Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns ...Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness. Bakers who thought American families wouldn\'t want a service that saved them seconds at the kitchen counter clearly didn\'t understand the time demands of American families.

Sources state that she was the daughter of Nereus and Doris, which makes Amphitrite one of the fifty sea goddesses (or nymphs) who are known collectively as the Nereids. The Greek poet Hesiod lists the names of these sea nymphs in his Theogony:  “To Nereus and Doris of the lovely hair,  the daughter of Okeanos, the stream surrounding the earth,  a host of godly daughters was born in the barren sea:  Proto, Eukrante, Amphitrite, and Sao…”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 240-43)  According to the legend, the Olympian Poseidon (who was himself a god of the sea) saw Amphitrite one day and fell in love with the graceful and beautiful goddess. However, the sea nymph initially resisted Poseidon’s advances. But Poseidon was not easily discouraged. He sent his sea creatures to find Amphitrite. A dolphin succeeded in locating the Nereid, and it was this creature - the dolphin - who persuaded her to consider Poseidon’s proposal. Eventually, Amphitrite accepted Poseidon, and the two gods were married.  Amphitrite and Poseidon were together the parents of several children, including the sea god Triton. Here’s Hesiod again:  “From the union of rumbling Poseidon and Amphitrite  came the great Triton, whose might is far-flung,  an awesome god dwelling in a golden house that lies  at the sea’s bottom, near his cherished mother and lordly father.”  (Hesiod, Theogony, lines 930 ff. )  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea - Greek Gods and GoddessesAmphitrite Goddess of the Sea  [ ? ]Subscribe To This Site  Amphitrite Goddess of the Sea  In Greek mythology, Amphitrite goddess of the Sea was one of the fifty Nereids, that is a daughter of Nereus and Doris - that\'s what Hesiod writes in his Theogony (but Apollodorus says her parents were Oceanus and Thetys). Her Roman equivalent was Salacia, god Neptune\'s wife.  Her name means "The third one who encircles (everything)" (because the ancient Greeks thought the whole world was encircled by a river-god, Oceanus ).  She spent most of the time singing and dancing with her sisters. One day Poseidon, god of the sea , saw her near the island of Naxos and fell in love with her. He kidnapped her and made her his wife.  In another story, Amphitrite, being a shy girl, fled away and hid somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Poseidon wanted desperately to find her, so he sent all the marine creatures to look for her. Delphinus, a dolphin, managed to find her and convinced her to go back to Poseidon and marry him. That\'s what made Amphitrite goddess of the sea. (By the way, the dolphin who found her was turned into a constellation by the grateful Poseidon ).  Amphitrite goddess of the sea has no special attributions (but sometimes she can calm the waters), she is just the mistress of the sea (and sometimes she is considered the mother of the marine creatures, but they existed even before she became queen of the sea). Some even say that she is just a personification of the sea.  She also appeared briefly in the story of Theseus. King Minos asked the hero to prove that he really was Poseidon\'s son. A ring was thrown into the sea and Theseus had to bring it back. The sea creatures found the ring and gave it to the hero, while Amphitrite goddess of the sea received him in her underwater palace and gave him a golden crown, which he took to Ariadne as a wedding gift. (As you can see, Amphitrite was the ideal wife, as she was never jealous of her husband\'s love affairs.)  Amphitrite and Poseidon had a son, Triton (a fish-man or a he-mermaid) and a daughter, Rhode, and maybe another daughter, Benthesicyme.

Br\'er Rabbit is a trickster who succeeds by his wits rather than by brawn, provoking authority figures and bending social mores as he sees fit. The Walt Disney Company later adapted this character for its 1946 animated motion picture Song of the South.  Tar-Baby story   In one tale, Br\'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and dresses it with some clothes. When Br\'er Rabbit comes along he addresses the Tar-Baby amiably, but receives no response. Br\'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the Tar-Baby\'s lack of manners, punches it, and in doing so becomes stuck. The more Br\'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar "baby" out of rage, the more he gets stuck. When Br\'er Fox reveals himself, the helpless but cunning Br\'er Rabbit pleads, "please, Br\'er Fox, don\'t fling me in dat brier-patch," prompting Fox to do exactly that. As rabbits are at home in thickets, the resourceful Br\'er Rabbit uses the thorns and briers to escape. The story was originally published in Harper\'s Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris included his version of the tale in his Uncle Remus stories.  African origins   The Br\'er Rabbit stories can be traced back to trickster figures in Africa, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in West, Central, and Southern Africa. These tales continue to be part of the traditional folklore of numerous peoples throughout those regions. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider Anansi, though the plots in his tales are often identical with those of stories of Br\'er Rabbit.  However, Anansi does encounter a tricky rabbit called "Adanko" (Asante-Twi to mean "Hare") in some stories. The Jamaican character with the same name "Brer Rabbit", is an adaptation of the Ananse stories of the Akan people.   Some scholars have suggested that in his American incarnation, Br\'er Rabbit represented the enslaved Africans who used their wits to overcome adversity and to exact revenge on their adversaries, the White slave-owners.  Though not always successful, the efforts of Br\'er Rabbit made him a folk hero. However, the trickster is a multi-dimensional character. While he can be a hero, his amoral nature and his lack of any positive restraint can make him into a villain as well.   For both Africans and African Americans, the animal trickster represents an extreme form of behavior that people may be forced to adopt in extreme circumstances in order to survive. The trickster is not to be admired in every situation. He is an example of what to do, but also an example of what not to do. The trickster\'s behavior can be summed up in the common African proverb: "It\'s trouble that makes the monkey chew on hot peppers." In other words, sometimes people must use extreme measures in extreme circumstances.  Several elements in the Brer Rabbit Tar Baby story (e.g., rabbit needing to be taught a lesson, punches and head-butting the rabbit does, the stuck rabbit being swung around and around) are reminiscent of those found in a Zimbabwe-Botswana folktale.   Folklorists in the late 19th century first documented evidence that the American versions of the stories originated among enslaved West Africans based on connections between Br\'er Rabbit and Leuk, a rabbit trickster in Senegalese folklore.  The stories of Br\'er Rabbit were written down by Robert Roosevelt, an uncle of US President Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography about his aunt from the State of Georgia, that "She knew all the \'Br\'er Rabbit\' stories, and I was brought up on them. One of my uncles, Robert Roosevelt, was much struck with them, and took them down from her dictation, publishing them in Harper\'s, where they fell flat.

Unlike tides they are almost constant in their direction and their  velocity fluctuates only by small amounts according to the seasons of the year.  Ocean currents help to  distribute heat around the Earth and circulate massive amounts of warm and cold  water. Ocean current flow rates are measured in Sv units where one Sv is equal  to 1 million m3/s. Two of the fastest flowing ocean currents are the  Florida Current running into the Gulf Stream off the USA  eastern seaboard and the Agulhas current off the south and east coast of  southern Africa.  Florida Current  Beginning in the  Caribbean and ending in the northern North Atlantic, the Florida Current  leading into the Gulf Stream is a north flowing ocean current that reaches  speeds in excess of 2.0m/s, particularly in the Florida Current region closest  to the USA’s  eastern seaboard. The Gulf Stream begins upstream of Cape Hatteras (North  Carolina), where the Florida Current ceases to follow the continental shelf and  heads out into the Atlantic. The transport varies from 30 Sv in the Florida  Current to a maximum of 150 Sv at 55°W in the Gulf Stream.  The most appropriate location for deploying Evopods would be the Florida Current off from Miami where it adheres to the continental shelf in no more than 150m water depth. Extracting 1GW of power (8.8TWh/y) from the Florida Current in the region where it flows at 2m/s would require turbines with an accumulated cross section area of about 1.6M m2 (1500 twin turbine Evopod units each rated at 1500kW) or about 10% of the total flow cross section and would take out 3.3% of the energy from the stream.  Agulhas Current  The Agulhas current flows in a southerly and westerly direction from the Mozambique channel between Africa and Madagascar, down round the south east coast of South Africa past the industrial cities of Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth and eventually interacts with the cold north flowing Benguela current off the southern tip of Africa at Cape Agulhas. The Agulhas current has a volume flow rate of between 70Sv to 85Sv and has a peak speed of about 2m/s in the region off East London.  Extracting 1GW of power (8.8TWh/y) from the Agulhas  Current in the region where it flows at 2m/s would require turbines with an  accumulated cross section area of about 1.6M m2 or about 4% of the  total flow cross section and would take out 1.5% of the energy from the stream.  Much more research is required into this area before it can be confirmed that  it is appropriate for deployment of tidal current devices. However, Eskom, South    Africa’s national utility company has  claimed that the Agulhas current has considerable potential for bulk power  generation and have commissioned studies to investigate routes to exploitation.

There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient\'s duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP\'s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don\'t deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.

Yazoo was the template for Erasure , Clarke\'s long-running collaboration with diva Andy Bell , and numerous new bands that blended dance-pop and synthesizers. In 2008, Clarke and Moyet united for a tour of the U.K., Europe, and North America. The concerts were recorded and the result is this two-CD set. Clarke revamped and re-recorded the backing tracks for the two Yazoo albums, so these in-concert performances have a warmer, fuller instrumental sound. Clarke still plays and sequences the tunes live, but today\'s technology has smoothed out the brittle high end that made some of Yazoo \'s songs sound like video game soundtracks. For her part, Moyet \'s voice has aged well. It\'s richer and deeper; her vocals are even more affecting than they were 26 years ago. Both artists seem almost surprised by the crowd reactions and the power of their own performance. At the end of "State Farm," the funky white-girl rap from You and Me Both that kicks off side two of the set, Moyet laughs with almost girlish delight at the crowd\'s enthusiastic reaction. The duo did 27 dates, and the 20 selections here are taken from various concerts. There are no liner notes in the two-CD set (there is also a deluxe limited edition with a hardback book and download codes), so you don\'t know the origin of any of the performances, but that\'s a minor quibble. The set is arranged to play like a live show, and the music ebbs and flows to build up to smashing renditions of their big hits -- a thumping "Bring Your Love Down (Didn\'t I)," a bouncy "Don\'t Go" that still sounds a bit like early Depeche Mode and has the crowd singing along on the hook, a smoldering rendition of "Only You," and a rousing, extended take of "Situation" with Clarke adding distorted synth effects to push the tune along.

According to Helders ' mother , who drove the teenagers to and from their rehearsal space three times a week : `` If they knew you were there , they would just stop so we had to sneak in ... Half the time , though , they were playing table tennis . '' At first , the band 's original songs featured nonsense words but Turner eventually began to share his own lyrics with his bandmates : `` I had this sense of dread that the others would laugh me out of the room . Mickey - taking is a useful quality control . '' They practised for a year before playing a live show : `` A lot of people have an idea of the music they wan na make and then they go make it , but we started the band to have something to do and then figured all that stuff out . '' `` I 'm quite easily influenced . I could have ended up anywhere with a little push from whoever . So it was important that it was us four . '' Their first gig was on Friday , 13 June 2003 , supporting The Sound at a local pub called The Grapes .

Changes include the development of the Hillsborough stadium, players, the board and the general infrastructure of the club.  Owls fans already know, Sheffield Wednesday is more than a football club. Sheffield Wednesday is a symbol. The blue and white stripes, the ‘Owl’ and the motto ‘Consilio et Animis’ (Wisdom and courage) are just some representations of the club that are seen throughout the UK each time the players step onto the playing turf.  As Wednesday fans, we are all part of the S6 family. Mascot, Ozzie the Owl, is one well known Hillsborough icon known by the fans young and old. Ozzie the Owl is often seen before, during and post-match.  Ozzie was an ever present as matchday mascot from 1990 to 2006. He was then reintroduced in 2009, a home league fixture to Charlton Athletic in January of that year. Initially, Ozzie the Owl was a character created by Ruben Grossman back in 1949, appearing in the ‘Funny Folks’ publication.  This week I\xa0caught up with Ozzie the Owl to question him on the past, present and future of Sheffield Wednesday.  Q: When and how did you become a Sheffield Wednesday mascot?  A:\xa01999/2000 season, recommendation from a friend at the club.  Q: How do you and fellow mascot Barney prepare for a match day?  A: Nothing special, make sure we drink plenty of water as dehydration is a concern.  We meet up about 1:30 and work out where we need to visit.  Q: Besides matchday, what other opportunities arise as a Sheffield Wednesday mascot?  A: Mascot Races, Parties, Charity Events, Owls in the Park to name a few.  Q: What is the best thing about being a Sheffield Wednesday mascot?  A: I get to be part of the club I love and support.  Q: Current favourite Sheffield Wednesday player and why?  A: Keiren Westwood. In my playing days I was a keeper, so I always appreciate a great keeper.  Q: Favourite ever Sheffield Wednesday player and why?  A: Following on from my previous answer, has to be the legend that is Kevin Pressman! He is the reason I became a keeper.  Q: Best Sheffield Wednesday moment at Hillsborough?  A: From a personal point of view the promotion game against Wycombe. All four sides of the great stadium full of Wednesday fans in party mode! An atmosphere never to be forgotten.  Q: Best game you have seen at Hillsborough?  A: The recent 6-0 demolition of Leeds sticks in my mind.  Q: Best goal you have seen at Hillsborough?  A: The one that springs to mind is Di Piedi’s overhead kick vs Sunderland in the League Cup.  Q: Expectations this season?  A: It would be brilliant to get automatic promotion, but a play-off place should be achievable. Top 10 should be the minimum aim.  Q: Where do you see Sheffield Wednesday in three\xa0years?  A: In the Premier League!!!  Hopefully we will see mascots Ozzie & Barney long into the future at Hillsborough as we continue to take progressive forward steps towards the Premier League.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ozzie for taking the time to answer my questions.

What is the History of Fleet Street?  charlesdickenspage.com  Main Image:\xa0  Fleet Street is the name of a popular street in London that was once the centre of British Press and Journalism. Up till the 1980s most of the Offices of the British press was housed on Fleet Street. Today many media agencies have moved out of Fleet Street but the Street continues to represent the British Press. The Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. The tube stations nearest to Fleet Street are Chancery Lane, Temple and Blackfriars. There are many streets in London which may surpass the Fleet Street in its architectural design but the Fleet Street is regarded historically as one of London’s important streets.  Content  \xa0  What is the Etymology of Fleet Street?  The name Fleet Street is derived from the name of River Fleet that is now an underground stream. Fleet street once had all the important newspaper offices almost till the 1980.s However by 2005 the last of the British press agencies, the Reuters left Fleet Sreet. The Street is so strongly linked with British Journalists that even now it is used synonymously for the British Press.  \xa0  \xa0  What is the History of Fleet Street?\xa0  The use of the name Fleet Street can be dated back to the 13th century when it was known as Fleet Bridge Street. Around the 14th century the Street came to be known by its present usage. Publishing began in Fleet Street with the setting up of a printing shop by Wynkyn de Worde,apprentice to William Caxton. Around the same time, Richard Pynson set up his publishing and printing office near St. Dunstan’s Church. This was followed by a number of other publishers and printers with The Daily Courant-London;s first daily paper setting up its premises on Fleet Street in March 1702.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  Where is Fleet Street Located?\xa0  The Street named as Fleet Street started from the City of London and extended till WestmininserThe Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. In former times the River Fleet acted like the boundary of the medieval city of London,enforced by walls to ward off any foreign invasions. The construction of the Fleet Street in the city London marked the expansion of London in the early 14th century. While the River Fleet flowed at the East end of the street,the West end is marked by the Temple Bar ,setting the city limits. To the south of the Fleet Street lies The Temple, which is a complex of buildings formerly owned by the Knights Templar.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  What is the Status of the Present Day Fleet Street?

The star of the books Angels and Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2004) and The Lost Symbol (2009), Langdon is a dashing scholar and professor of religious symbology at Harvard University, whose love of antiquities draws him into myterious and deadly adventures. In Angels and Demons he tangles with a secret society known as the Illuminati, and in The Da Vinci Code he investigates a murder in the Louvre and discovers mysterious clues leading to the Catholic Church, Jesus and Mary Magdalene , and Leonardo Da Vinci .  Langdon was played by actor Tom Hanks in the 2006 film of The Da Vinci Code; his colleague, the French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, was played by Audrey Tautou . Hanks reprised the role in the 2009 film of Angels and Demons, this time with actress Ayelet Zurer as his brainy female sidekick.  Extra credit:  In The DaVinci Code, Robert Langdon is described as looking like “ Harrison Ford in Harris tweed”… According to Angels and Demons, Langdon was “a varsity diver in prep school and in college”… In real life there is no professorship of religious symbology at Harvard; Brown invented the position for his tales.

Langdon is a Harvard University professor of Religious Iconology and Symbology.  Character development  Dan Brown created the character as a fictional alter ego of himself, or of “the man he wishes he could be.” Brown was born June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire. Likewise, the fictional Langdon is described as also having been born on June 22 in Exeter, and having attending the same school as Brown did, Phillips Exeter Academy.  Brown named the character after John Langdon, a professor of typography at Drexel University who is known for his creation of ambigrams, typographical designs that can be read in multiple ways; for example, right side up and upside down. An example of Langdon’s ambigrams appeared on the cover of the first edition of Angels & Demons.  Storyline  Little background detail is provided by Brown. In The Da Vinci Code, Langdon wears a turtleneck, a Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers, and does this to all events, ranging from lectures to social events. A frequently referred to accessory is his Mickey Mouse watch, a gift from his parents on his ninth birthday. He drives an automatic Saab 900S.  Langdon was a diver at Phillips Exeter Academy in prep school and played water polo at Princeton University, where he went for college. He suffers from claustrophobia, the fear of enclosed spaces, stemming from the time he fell into a well when he was 7 years old. His father died when he was 12, and his new mentor father-figure became Peter Solomon, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  Known for his brilliant problem-solving mind and his genius, Langdon has an eidetic memory and an understanding of semiotics. As a professor at Harvard University, he teaches Religious Iconology and the fictional field of Symbology. The fast-paced thriller Angels & Demons follows Langdon’s attempts to protect the Vatican from the Illuminati, a secret society formed during the Renaissance that was opposed to the Roman Catholic Church.  Brown brought back Langdon in The Da Vinci Code, a thriller that centres on art history, Christianity’s origins, and arcane theories. Attempting to solve the murder of the Louvre’s curator, Langdon encounters mysterious organizations (Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion), discusses the hidden messages in Leonardo da Vinci | Question: Who played 'Robert Langdon' in 'The Da Vinci Code'?", ['tom hanks'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-7421'), ('Context: Whereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad , the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within , at , and outside its borders .

Mount Meager is a potentially active volcano in the Canadian province of British Columbia , Canada , 150 kilometers north of Vancouver . The top of the mountain is mostly covered by snow and glaciers . It lies in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and is the northernmost volcano of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that extends down to northern California . Its most common type of rock is lava that is almost a million years old (with a thickness in some places over 1\xa0km).  The mountain is part of the Pacific Ranges of mountains and is 2,680 meters (8,793 feet) high. It was previously called Cathedral Mountain.  Geologic history  Meager is known for its last major eruption about 2,350 years ago. The strange thing about the eruption was the fact it released the debris from the northeast side of the volcano, as rock and ash blocked a major river called the Lillooet River . The river was dammed to a height of at least 100 meters, forming a lake . The lake reached a maximum elevation of 810 meters and was at least 50 meters deep. The breccia soon eroded from water activity within the lake, forming Keyhole Falls. There was a massive flood when the water first broke through the breccia, carrying small house sized blocks of breccia. During this eruption, ash was hurled into the air over 20 kilometers above sea level. The ash was carried eastward as far as Alberta .  Volcanic hazards  Meager is an unstable volcano. It is built of unstable volcanic and has dumped clay and rock several meters deep into the Perberton Valley at least three times during the last 7,300 years. Two earlier debris flows, around 4,450 and 7,300 years ago, sent rubble at least 32 kilometers from the volcano. Recently, the volcano has created smaller landslides about every ten years, including one in 1975 that killed four geologists near Meager Creek. Logging, mining, tourism and wilderness recreation on nearby slopes and valleys are vulnerable to the volcano’s excellent geomorphic activity. The possibility of Mount Meager covering settled parts of the Pemberton Valley in a debris flow is estimated at about one in 2400 years. There is no sign of volcanic eruptions with these events, however scientists warn the volcano could release another massive debris flow over populated areas anytime without warning.  The explosive nature of past eruptions at Mount Meager indicates that this volcano also poses a considerable long-distance treat to communities across southern British Columbia and Alberta. It is also a local treat to the town of Pemberton, British Columbia, about 50\xa0km away. Another explosive eruption at Mount Meager would also have a considerable impact on local mining and logging operations, as well as significant negative impacts on the Lillooet River fishery.

Reese FullerThe Last Perique Farmer | R. Reese Fuller  Home » The Last Perique Farmer  The Last Perique Farmer  Perique tobacco only grows in St. James Parish.            Percy Martin farms the world’s supply – all 12 acres of it.  August 21, 2002  Percy Martin sits in the cab of his pickup truck             under the shade of a pecan tree. His 10-year-old poodle,  Fifi, sits            in his lap. He’s 84 years old and has a bad knee.  He gets around in            his truck, his four-wheeler or with an  aluminum cane.  He farms 235 acres just outside the town of  Paulina            in the community of Grande Pointe in St. James  Parish. With the help            of his five sons – Percy Jr., Leo, Ray,  Brian and Teddy – he raises            tomatoes, bell peppers,  sugar-cane and perique tobacco. They plant,            harvest and  process the last 12 acres of perique in the world. And they             do it all by hand.  St. James Parish was once a predominantly  agricultural            community, but the industrial plants that now  rest on the horizon are            luring the younger generations into  newer fields not cultivated by their            forefathers. The sign  outside of the parish’s visitors’ center reads, “Community  and Industry Working Together.”  Percy says his grandchildren are “making more             money than all of us put together.” He hopes that his sons will             be able to farm perique after he’s gone, but he doesn’t think  the 200-year-old            tradition will continue with the fifth  generation.  “I don’t believe I’m going to last too darn            long either,” he says with a laugh.  Percy cultivates perique, but he doesn’t smoke.             The tobacco’s too strong and “when I work in it, that’s  enough.” His heavy French accent sounds like he’s from south  of Abbeville, even            though he’s only 50 miles from downtown  New Orleans. He was born and            raised in Grande Pointe. His  grandfather and his father raised perique.            When he was a boy,  there were some 15 families who maintained 500 acres            of the  tobacco.  Perique grows only in St. James Parish. No one             has been able to pinpoint why it will only take root there, but  there            are generally three accepted factors that make perique  distinct – the            St. James soil, the perique seed and the  fermentation process. Percy            has even heard that some  scientists believe that St. James Parish sits            on top of a  mineral deposit that gives the tobacco its robust and distinct             flavor. He doesn’t know if that’s true, though. What he does know is             that he needs seeds, soil and fermentation to make perique.  Perique’s distinctive and powerful flavor makes             it nearly impossible to smoke by itself. It’s usually blended  with other            tobaccos at a very low percentage to add another  dimension of flavor            to the dominant tobacco. If your average  tobacco could be compared to            a light beer, then perique would  be a barley wine – strong, heavy and            bearable only in small  doses. And although the fermentation process            makes for a  stronger-tasting smoke, it has been proven to produce a            lower  nicotine content than other domestic tobaccos.  Percy has high hopes for this year’s crop, but             he also felt the same way about last year’s crop. That was  before Tropical            Storm Allison rolled into town, raining for  six days straight and leaving            24 inches of rain.  “That just about wiped us out,” he says.  The Martins managed to salvage a fifth of what            they had expected to take in.  “That was about enough to quit for good,” he says. “How would you like to work and your boss won’t pay you? | Question: What would a person normally do with perique?', ['smoke it'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2201'), ('Context: Cheeses of Germany and Austria - How To Cooking Tips ...Cheeses of Germany and Austria - How To Cooking Tips - RecipeTips.com  Cheeses of Germany and Austria  Cheeses of Germany and Austria  Allgauer Emmentaler  Allgauer Emmentaler is a German cow\'s milk cheese that is much like Swiss Emmental.

The cheese is often served as a snack or used for sandwiches and for cooking.  Bruder Basil  Bruder Basil is a cow\'s milk cheese from Germany. It has a firm texture and a dark brownish colored natural rind. The cheese is pale yellow and contains very small random holes throughout. The flavor is rich with a slight smokiness. It is produced in small brick shapes that are covered with wax. Bruder Basil is excellent for grilling and for serving on sandwiches, and it is often served simply as a snack or an appetizer.  Cambozola  A cheese native to Germany and Austria, Cambozola is basically a combination of Camembert cheese and Gorgonzola cheese, thus the name, which also can be spelled, Cambazola. Soft and spreadable, Cambozola is made from cow\'s milk with cream added, which forms a cheese that is rich and creamy. The smooth interior contains a few blue veins running throughout, which gives the otherwise mild and somewhat mellow flavor of the cheese a hint of spiciness. The exterior of the cheese is coated with an outer white mold during production.  Considered to be a type of blue-brie cheese, Cambozola is well suited for salads and appetizers. It is often served with sliced meats and sausages. It can be also added to sauces as a flavorful touch. When served as is, Cambozola should be allowed to reach room temperature to achieve its optimum flavor.  Farmhouse  Farmhouse is a term that is commonly applied to any of the different types of European cheeses that are made by traditional cheese making methods and are produced from the raw milk of animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep that are raised on small regional farms, mountain chalet farms, or mountain huts. The quantities of cheese produced from farmhouse methods are small. When approved for production by the European AOC (Appellation d\'Origine Controlee) the cheese is categorized as a "fermier" or "farmhouse" variety. Although this term originated in Europe, it is also often used to classify American varieties of cheese.  Farmstead  The term, Farmstead Cheeses, refers to cheeses made with milk collected from a group of farms that are located within close proximity to where the cheese is produced. Typically, the owners of the farms raise their animals on similar grasses, in similar areas, and with similar methods to produce the milk that is used in the production of the cheese. A similar term often associated with European cheeses is farmhouse cheese,referring to cheeses produced in lower volumes and made on individual farms that are situated in valleys, mountainous areas, or the meadowlands of Europe.  Limburger  Limburger cheese was first produced by the Trappist monks in Belgium in the early 18th century. Today, Limburger is produced throughout the world, but it is most often found in the U.K., U.S., and Germany-especially Germany, where it is so popular that it is often thought of as a cheese of German origin.  Limburger is a cow\'s milk cheese produced in wheels, blocks, or wedges of cheese. Covered with a thin edible rind that is light ivory to reddish brown in color, the paste of the Limburger cheese is white, smoothly textured, and sharp or salty tasting. Limburger cheese is soft-ripened for three to four months using coryneform bacteria. The bacteria combine with the acids in the cheese to produce molecules that contribute significantly in providing Limburger with its most famous characteristic—its pungent aroma.  Most often, Limburger cheese goes well with hearty meats; robust red wines or dark beers; and earthy brown breads, such as rye or heavy wheat breads. It may also be combined with crackers, fruits, raw onions, salty fish, and nuts when served as an appetizer.

This revolution resulted in the urbanization of the city. In 1817 the Maling company, at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city. The Victorian industrial revolution brought industrial structures that included the 2 1⁄2-mile (4.0 km) Victoria Tunnelling, built in 1842, which provided underground wagon ways to the staithes. On 3 February 1879, Mosley Street in the city, was the first public road in the world to be lit up by the incandescent lightbulb. Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting. Innovations in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps, Stephenson's Rocket, Lord Armstrong's artillery, Be-Ro flour, Joseph Swan's electric light bulbs, and Charles Parsons' invention of the steam turbine, which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity.

(2) In any action with an opposing armed force of               a foreign country in which the Armed Forces of the United States               are or have been engaged.  (3) While serving with friendly foreign forces               engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in               which the United States is not a belligerent party.  (4) As a result of an act of any such enemy of               opposing armed forces.  (5) As the result of an act of any hostile foreign               force.  (6) After 28 March 1973, as a result of an               international terrorist attack against the United States or a               foreign nation friendly to the United States, recognized as such               an attack by the Secretary of the Army, or jointly by the               Secretaries of the separate armed Services concerned if persons               from more than one service are wounded in the attack.

While clearly an individual decoration, the               Purple Heart differs from all other decorations in that an               individual is not "recommended" for the decoration;               rather he or she is entitled to it upon meeting specific criteria.  (1) A Purple Heart is authorized for the first               wound suffered under conditions indicated above, but for each               subsequent award an Oak Leaf Cluster will be awarded to be worn on               the medal or ribbon. Not more than one award will be made for more               than one wound or injury received at the same instant or from the               same missile, force, explosion, or agent.  (2) A wound is defined as an injury to any part of               the body from an outside force or agent sustained under one or               more of the conditions listed above.\xa0 A physical lesion is not               required, however, the wound for which the award is made must have               required treatment by a medical officer and records of medical               treatment for wounds or injuries received in action must have been               made a matter of official record.  (3) When contemplating an award of this               decoration, the key issue that commanders must take into               consideration is the degree to which the enemy caused the injury.               The fact that the proposed recipient was participating in direct               or indirect combat operations is a necessary prerequisite, but is               not sole justification for award.  (4) Examples of enemy-related injuries which               clearly justify award of the Purple Heart are as follows:\xa0  (a) Injury caused by enemy bullet, shrapnel, or               other projectile created by enemy action.  (b) Injury caused by enemy placed mine or trap.  (c) Injury caused by enemy released chemical,               biological or nuclear agent.  (d) Injury caused by vehicle or aircraft accident               resulting from enemy fire.  (e) Concussion injuries caused as a result of               enemy generated explosions.

There are 5 families of lemur with more than 50 species and hundreds of subspecies. Lemurs originated in Africa, but they were outcompeted by large monkeys and apes. They had left Africa 62 to 65 million years ago and arrived to Madagascar on large rafts made of vegetation. With only few natural enemies, lemurs managed to quickly occupy the entire island and evolve into numerous species. Unfortunately, 90% of all known lemur species will probably become extinct in the next 20 to 25 years due to accelerated habitat loss and illegal hunting.  Interesting Lemur Facts:  Lemur can reach 3.6 to 27 inches in length and 1.1 ounce to 20 pounds of weight. Dwarf mouse lemur is the smallest species of lemur, while Indri lemur is the largest.  Lemur has thin fur that can be black, grey, brown or reddish colored.  Lemur has pointed nose, huge eyes and long bushy tail that is much longer than the rest of the body (it can reach 22 to 25 inches in length in the large species). Lemur has human-like hands with opposable thumbs and flat fingernails. Second toe on the hind feet is equipped with claw that is used for grooming.  Lemur is very intelligent animal. It can learn to use tool and perform simple arithmetic tasks.  Name "lemur" means "spirits of the night" in Latin, and it refers to the nocturnal nature of these animals. Despite the name, some lemurs are also active during the day.  Lemur is adapted to the life in the trees, but some species, such as ring-tailed lemur, spend plenty of time on the ground. Lemur can stand on two legs, but it always walks on four legs.  Lemur eats fruit, leaves, flowers, tree sap and bark. Plant-based diet is occasionally supplemented with small vertebrates and insects.  Lemur plays important role in dispersal of seed in the wild.  Lemur can slow down its metabolism and hibernate when food is scarce (the only primate that hibernates).  Most species of lemur live in family groups of around 15 animals. Groups can be composed of animals of both or only one gender. Dominant female is the leader of the group. Some species, such as aye-aye, are solitary.  Lemurs communicate via scent from the glands on the feet and buttocks, via loud screeching noise and by using their long tails.  The only natural enemies of lemurs (besides humans) are fossa and the harrier hawk.  Lemurs mate only when there is plenty of food. Pregnancy lasts 9 to 24 weeks (depending on the species), and ends with 2 babies in most cases. Different species of lemur can interbreed in the captivity and create new hybrid species.  Lemurs reach sexual maturity at the age of 2 years.  Lemur can survive around 18 years in the wild and up to 30 years in the captivity.

Switzerland Flag is one of only two square sovereign-state flags in the world (the other being the flag of Vatican City) When used on water (at sea or on the vessels plying in Swiss lakes), the ratio of the size of the cross to the height is 5:8, and to the length is 5:12 and the flag can be of rectangular proportion with 2:3 or 7:10 dimensions  Switzerland Flag - Red Cross Symbol  The Red Cross symbol used by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a red cross on white background, was the original protection symbol declared at the first Geneva Convention, the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field of 1864. According to the ICRC the design was based on the Swiss flag by reversing of the colours of that flag, in order to honor Switzerland, where the first Geneva Convention was held, and its inventor and co-founder, the Swiss Henry Dunant.

On a red field, a white equilateral cross whose arms are one sixth longer than their width.  The relationship between the span of the cross and the width of the flag has not been established, but in practice the ratio is about 2:3 or 7:10.  The relative dimensions of the cross are defined in Article 1 of Federal Order #111 on the arms of the Helvetic Confederation (12 December 1889).  Unlike most flags of the world, the Swiss flag is square. This was an issue when Switzerland joined the UN in 2002, as all the flags displayed on UN Plaza should have the same size. The UN first had a rectangular flag, but the Swiss mission protested. Eventually the UN accepted a Swiss square flag. But, in order to have a flag that is not too small, the flag displayed on UN Plaza has the same area of a rectangular flag.

He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional football history.  The NFL\'s Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after his death.  Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.   Early years   Lombardi was born on June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico "Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972). Harry\'s mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy. Mattie\'s father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata. Harry had three siblings and Matilda had twelve. Vince would be the oldest of five children, Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe. The entire Lombardi and Izzo clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.  Matilda\'s father, Anthony, opened up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century. At about the time of Lombardi\'s birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District. Throughout the Great Depression, Harry\'s shop did well and his family prospered. Lombardi grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.  Church attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays. Mass would be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, extended family members, and local clergy. He was an altar boy at St. Mark\'s Catholic Church. Outside of their local neighborhood, the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed at the time against Italian immigrants. As a child, Lombardi helped his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it. At the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football league in Sheepshead Bay.  High school   Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.O\'Brien incorrectly implies he graduated in 1929 from eighth grade which is completely refuted by Maraniss and O\'Brien\'s date of 1928 makes no sense. O\'Brien, on page 28, writes he left after three years there when he left after four. He then matriculated with the Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest. At Cathedral, he played on the school\'s baseball and basketball teams, but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight. Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral. After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood. He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.His stint at seminary school would cost him one year of his academic life as he would be, generally speaking, repeating his senior year of high school in order to obtain a high school diploma. There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.  His playing as a fullback on the Terriers\' football team earned him a spot on the virtual All-City football team.

What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  What Is a \'Mulligan\' in Golf?  This golfer looks like he needed a mulligan.\xa0 John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images  By Brent Kelley  Updated February 05, 2016.  A mulligan, most simply put, is a "do-over" in golf. Hit a bad shot? Take a mulligan and replay that stroke . Drop a ball on the spot from which you just played, and re-play. The first (bad) shot is not counted.  Are Mulligans \'Legal\'?  No. There is never a time, when playing under the\xa0 Rules of Golf , that a mulligan is "legal." Mulligans are not allowed under the rules.  But Mulligans Are Very Popular  But just because mulligans aren\'t "legal" doesn\'t mean their use isn\'t common and popular among recreational golfers. Many amateurs and recreational golfers - players just out to have a fun round with buddies, as opposed to serious golfers looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway.  So mulligans are most often employed during friendly rounds by golf buddies; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the golfer can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each.  continue reading below our video  What Are Mulligans?  The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events.  Common Ways of Using Mulligans  Do all golfers use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of golfers agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you).  How many mulligans you get to use during a round, what types of shots you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from golfer to golfer. So if you\'re playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed.  Here are some common ways that mulligans are used:  Some golfers limit the use of mulligans to the first tee only, or to the first and 10th tees only.  Some golfers use one mulligan per nine holes, but anywhere on each nine.  It\'s most common for mulligans to be used only off the tee , i.e., you can only use a mulligan to replay a drive. However, some groups allow mulligans from the fairway , too.  Less common is allowing mulligans from the rough or out of hazards, but some golfers even do that.  It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used on the putting green .  And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere on the golf course, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per round, or nine, or 18.  Clearly, there are many different ways that golfers use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own "rules" about using them.  Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized golf customs, formats and betting games , when playing with golfers you don\'t know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later.  And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the Rules of Golf are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans.  Why Is It Called a \'Mulligan\'?  Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in golf came to be called a mulligan.

By Andrew Evans, National Geographic Traveler  In 7th grade I almost failed Latin.  It was the declensions that got me—also, as a 12-year old, learning a dead language was as abstract as the idea of traveling the world.  That all changed the first time I came to Europe, visited a Roman ruin, and discovered that I could read the weathered inscriptions on a 2,000 year-old stone wall. For me to comprehend a message scrawled by a disappeared civilization was simply illuminating. Latin suddenly made sense and it became my key to other languages and therefore my key to traveling the world.  Latin is still a very dead language—however, its closest living relative is doing just fine in the mountains and valleys of southeast Switzerland. In fact, you can even watch it on television.  "Welcome" in Romansh on a shop sign in Samedan, Engadin, Switzerland (Photo by AE/NGT)  \xa0  Romansh is the fourth official language of Switzerland (after Swiss German, French and Italian) and its proximity to Latin is astounding: Chesa is “house”, Chaun is “dog”, and paun is “bread”.  “It’s a Latin dialect, really,” explains Guido Ratti, a native-born Romansh speaker from the village of Samedan in the Swiss canton of Grischun. He spoke only Romansh until he was about eight years old, when he began studying his first foreign language at school: Swiss German.  “We always say—whoever knows Romansh, knows more,” says Guido, pointing out how the Romansh people of Switzerland tend to pick up other Romance languages quickly.  “Catalan is similar to Romansh and so are the dialects of Italy—so is Romanian,” he adds. “I remember in 1989 when Ceauşescu gave his final speech, I watched it on television and understood everything.  Native Romansh-speaker Niculin Bazzell speaks six different languages (Romansh, German, Italian, French, Spanish and English)—and he uses almost all of them “everyday” he says, mainly working with tourists.  “Our problem in Engadin is that we are so polite, we speak in whatever language our guest speaks,” explains Guido. People from all over the world come to Engadin for the mountains—in summer to hike and bike and in winter to ski. Guido is proud of the region’s hospitality, but feels it is crucial that they uphold Romansh in the area.  In Engadin, the first three years of school are taught entirely in Romansh, after which instruction gradually switches over to Swiss German. There is a full-time Romansh radio station and Romansh language television plays on Swiss TV, every night from 6:00 to 7:00 pm. (It’s like watching the news in Latin.)  According to Guido, there are “about 100,000 people who still speak [Romansh],” though the Swiss census counts only 60,000 speakers. In any case, Romansh is a minority language, spoken by less than 1% of the population. This group is broken down into four main dialects which together form a kind of linguistic tidal pool “leftover from the Roman soldiers who used to live in Engadin.”  Unlike Swiss German, Romansh is, in fact, a written language—a fact that plays a role in its survival. The Bible was first printed in Romansh in 1530, at the time of the reformation. And yet, oddly, Romansh was not made an official language of Switzerland until 1938, when the country voted by referendum to include it along with German, French and Italian.  “My language will survive!” proclaims Guido. Not only for its government protection but, “because so many people are conserving it.” Today, there is even a Romansh Wikipedia , however the long-term survival depends on parents passing it onto their children.  “I am completely Romansh and my sons speak Romansh but they both married girls from Zurich, so | Question: Romansh is a native and official language of which country?', ['switzerland'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-6751'), ('Context: History of Blood Transfusion - News-Medical.netHistory of Blood Transfusion  History of Blood Transfusion  By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD  The first research into blood transfusion dates back to the 17th Century when British physician William Harvey fully described the circulation and properties of blood in 1628. The first blood transfusions were also attempted around this time, although these were often unsuccessful and proved fatal in humans.  The first successful blood transfusion recorded was performed by British physician Richard Lower in 1665 when he bled a dog almost to death and then revived the animal by transfusing blood from another dog via a tied artery.  In 1667, Jean-Baptiste Denis who was physician to King Louis XIV, performed the transfusion of blood from an animal to a human. Denis transfused the blood from a sheep to a 15-year old boy and later to a labourer, both of whom survived the transfusions.  Related Stories  Zika virus infection can break down and damage testes of male mice, new research shows  In 1818, British obstetrician James Blundell successfully transfused human blood to a patient who had hemorrhaged during childbirth. In 1901, Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian physician discovered the first human blood groups, which helped transfusion to become a safer practice. By performing experiments in which he mixed blood samples taken from his staff, Landsteiner discovered blood groups A, B and O and established the basic principals of ABO compatibility. In 1907, an American surgeon called Reuben Ottenberg suggested that patient and donor blood should be grouped and cross matched before a blood transfusion procedure.  Between 1914 and 1918, anticoagulants such as sodium citrate were found to prolong the shelf life of blood and refrigeration also proved to be an effective means of preserving blood. In the 1920’s and 30’s, the voluntary donation of blood for storage and use was started. At around the same time, Edwin Cohn developed cold ethanol fractionation, a method of breaking down blood into its component parts to obtain albumin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen, for example.  During the Second World War, blood transfusion was used on a large scale to treat injured soldiers and became well known as a life saving procedure.  “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human ...Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″ | BRANCH  Matthew Rowlinson, “On the First Medical Blood Transfusion Between Human Subjects, 1818″  Abstract  The first experiments in blood transfusion took place in the seventeenth century, using blood drawn from animals. After the death of a French patient and the trial of his physician for manslaughter, transfusion was abandoned for a century and a half. When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth. During the course of the century, transfusion was applied as a remedy to different kinds of sicknesses and injuries, and performed at different times with various fluids. By the 1880s, British doctors had abandoned transfusion with blood in favor of infusion with saline solution; the practice was only again resumed after the recognition of human blood types in the twentieth century. Developments in the practice of transfusion and infusion during the century reflect shifting views of how gender and species identity are embodied, and of relations of affinity and immunity between bodies of different kinds. They also reflect a shift from a vitalist to a mechanist understanding of blood and its function.  Download this page in PDF format  Blood transfusion as a medical practice dates to the seventeenth century; [1] > the first experiments were performed a few decades after William Harvey published his demonstration that blood circulates in the body in De Motu Cordis (1628).\xa0 Harvey’s discovery showed that blood circulated indefinitely, rather than being either consumed within the body or expelled from it. To cure pathologies of the blood was thus no longer exclusively a matter of stimulating or preventing its evacuation; now the goal was to affect blood’s circulation within the body and its interaction with other organs. The earliest blood transfusions involving human subjects were carried out almost simultaneously in France and England in 1667.

It is one of the most important megalithic sites in Europe, known for the very high number of impressive prehistoric monuments found in the vicinity, and is situated on the Crach River, west of the small port of Vannes .  Introduction to Carnac  The ancient monuments feature numerous standing stones - at least 3000 are still standing - and various dolmens and menhirs and other ancient artefacts. The monuments were erected over a period of more than a thousand years, starting with neolithic man (another great prehistoric site, Stonehenge, was also constructed over a period of 1500 years, not \'all in one go\' as you might expect).  A large number of the alignments are now protected, and surrounded by fencing preventing access, which is a shame but necessary if they are to be preserved. There is also a substantial Museum of prehistory in the town.  Prehistoric terminology and ancient stone formations  No visit to Carnac would be complete without a knowledge of a few of the basics of prehistoric structure. (These terms will also help with the Visit Carnac section below).  The megalithic monuments are named from the Greek words mega (\'big\') and lithos (\'stones\'). These have different names according to type but the best known is the so-called "menhir" - a term of Breton origin, meaning stone (\'men\') and \'very high and stretched\' (\'hir\'). Normally the menhirs are not isolated but are aligned along a straight line and circle - in the second case they are called "Cromlechs", from the Breton "Crom" ( "circle") and "lech" ( "place"): so the "Cromlech" is a "place where the large stones are placed in a circle."  Besides the menhirs, another well-known monument is the \'Dolmen\'. The term means "stone table" (from the Breton \'dol\' (table) and \'men\' (stone). In practice this is a series of menhirs on top of which large stones are placed, forming a sort of room or tunnel. Another interesting aspect, next to menhirs and dolmens, is the \'tumulus’, or \'high lands\' (mounds of earth\'), found at some Cromlechs.  Visit Carnac  A tourist excursion though the monuments of Carnac should begin from the \'mound of Saint-Michel\' - a mound over 100 meters long, 35 wide and 10 metres high which protects several graves inside, where artefacts have been found dating back to 3500 BC.  Not far away you can see the famous alignment of \'Le Menech\', preceded by an oval cromlech over 100 meters in diameter and surrounded by 70 stones of one meter in height - the alignment of Le Menech heads toward the north-east, with eleven parallel lines monoliths. A Cromlech oval with a diameter of 90 meters, and close by the avenues of stone (1099 of them) are found along with a large dolmen.  An area of 240 meters divides it from the second alignment called \'Kermario\', (the "place of the dead"), which continues in the same direction with 10 parallel rows over a width of 100 meters and a length of over one kilometre, with over 1000 tall menhirs. Towards the north a giant menhir stands, known as the Giant Manius and to the south there is the Kerkado mound, which marks the beginning of the next alignment of Kerlescan, meaning the \'place of cremation\'.  This consists of more than 10 parallel rows of nearly 500 stones with different heights over a width of 140 meters followed by a semicircular cromlech approximately delimited by 40 monoliths. To the south is the so-called "Petit Menech", formed by about 100 stones.

The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week - The Atlantic  The Atlantic  Happy Birthday, Sliced Bread! The \'Greatest Thing\' Turns 85 This Week  Good thinking, Otto Frederick Rohwedder.  Most Popular  Print  Text Size  On July 7, 1928, Missouri\'s Chillicothe Baking Company made history by selling the first wrapped package of sliced bread in history.  What took so long?  It starts with the whole wrapping-the-loaf thing. Sliced bread goes stale remarkably quickly, as anybody who\'s forgotten to tie that little wire thing around a plastic bread bag has learned a million times already. So the trick is inventing a machine that cuts the bread finely while efficiently and securely wrapping the entire loaf.  In 1912, Otto Frederick Rohwedder, a jeweler from Missouri, solved the problem. He invented prototype of a machine that could both slice and wrap a loaf  of bread ... only to see his invention destroyed in a fire. Fifteen years and a few tweaks later, he filed this patent, the first ever for a "MACHINE FOR SLICING AN ENTIRE LOAF OF BREAD AT A SINGLE LOCATION."  At first bakers were not impressed, Don Voorhees explained in Why Do Donuts Have Holes?: Fascinating Facts About What We Eat And Drink. The machine failed in aesthetics where it succeeded in convenience, "[producing] loaves that did not sell because they were sloppy looking." Sliced bread needed a makeover before families realized how great it was ...  Enter one Gustav Papendick. The St. Louis baker brought Rohwedder\'s second machine in 1928 and perfected it. His improved design packaged the sliced loaves in cardboard trays, keeping the bread neat and orderly, and wrapped it in wax paper.  The first commercial bakery to try a bread-slicing machine was the Chillicothe Baking Company in Chillicothe, Missouri. Sales weren\'t fast and furious, though. Bakeries were skeptical about the public\'s acceptance of presliced bread. They thought that the drawbacks of having to buy new equipment and having to wrap the bread right away to keep the slices together might not be worth the trouble. After all, what if this pre sliced bread thing was just a passing fad? Would people really buy bread that would get stale faster just so they wouldn\'t have to slice it themselves?  Apparently the bakers weren\'t very farsighted. Presliced bread went national when Wonder introduced it to the country in 1930.  You know the rest. Except for a brief ban on presliced bread at the end of the Second World War (to preserve both food and metal for soldiers), the invention stimulated America\'s love affair with loaves. And as Americans ate more breads, Voorhees noted, they also ate more spreads: butter, jams, jellies, and so on.  So, two business lessons from sliced bread for the road. First, all innovation is tweaking. Rohwedder\'s prototype couldn\'t sell until Papendick perfected it, and presliced bread didn\'t go mainstream until Wonder Bread took it national two years later. Second, never make a financial bet against American laziness.

What is the History of Fleet Street?  charlesdickenspage.com  Main Image:\xa0  Fleet Street is the name of a popular street in London that was once the centre of British Press and Journalism. Up till the 1980s most of the Offices of the British press was housed on Fleet Street. Today many media agencies have moved out of Fleet Street but the Street continues to represent the British Press. The Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. The tube stations nearest to Fleet Street are Chancery Lane, Temple and Blackfriars. There are many streets in London which may surpass the Fleet Street in its architectural design but the Fleet Street is regarded historically as one of London’s important streets.  Content  \xa0  What is the Etymology of Fleet Street?  The name Fleet Street is derived from the name of River Fleet that is now an underground stream. Fleet street once had all the important newspaper offices almost till the 1980.s However by 2005 the last of the British press agencies, the Reuters left Fleet Sreet. The Street is so strongly linked with British Journalists that even now it is used synonymously for the British Press.  \xa0  \xa0  What is the History of Fleet Street?\xa0  The use of the name Fleet Street can be dated back to the 13th century when it was known as Fleet Bridge Street. Around the 14th century the Street came to be known by its present usage. Publishing began in Fleet Street with the setting up of a printing shop by Wynkyn de Worde,apprentice to William Caxton. Around the same time, Richard Pynson set up his publishing and printing office near St. Dunstan’s Church. This was followed by a number of other publishers and printers with The Daily Courant-London;s first daily paper setting up its premises on Fleet Street in March 1702.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  Where is Fleet Street Located?\xa0  The Street named as Fleet Street started from the City of London and extended till WestmininserThe Fleet Street came into existence in the 1400s starting from the Fleet River to the Strand. In former times the River Fleet acted like the boundary of the medieval city of London,enforced by walls to ward off any foreign invasions. The construction of the Fleet Street in the city London marked the expansion of London in the early 14th century. While the River Fleet flowed at the East end of the street,the West end is marked by the Temple Bar ,setting the city limits. To the south of the Fleet Street lies The Temple, which is a complex of buildings formerly owned by the Knights Templar.\xa0  \xa0  \xa0  What is the Status of the Present Day Fleet Street?  Fleet Street is now associated with law as its inns and chambers are occupied by barristers, mostly located in down alleys from where the former newspaper offices have moved to Wapping and Canary Wharf.The office occupied by “The Daily Telegraph ” has now become the headquarters of Goldman Sachs,an nvestment bank. Another private bank,C.Hoare&Co. has been based on Fleet Street since 1690. However a number of British New agencies such as D.C Thomas & Co, Commonwealth Broadcasting Associatio,\xa0\xa0continue to function from Fleet Street.

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology. Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C. (1962) .

Bradford attended Putnam City North High School in Oklahoma City, where he starred in football, basketball and golf.  As a senior quarterback in 2005, he threw for 2,029 yards and 17 touchdowns in 12 games.  Bradford was not highly recruited coming out of high school, but he did receive a scholarship offer from the University of Oklahoma, which he accepted.  After a redshirt season in 2006, Bradford threw for 3,121 yards and 36 touchdowns as a redshirt freshman.  That set the stage for a phenomenal 2008 year, when Bradford became only the second sophomore to win the Heisman Trophy as he was the trigger man for the highest-scoring offense in NCAA history, throwing for 4,464 yards with 48 touchdowns and just six interceptions.  He again led the nation in passing and also added five rushing touchdowns as the Sooners went 12-1 and advanced to the BCS national title game.  Bradford declared for the NFL draft following the 2009 season and was drafted by the St. Louis Rams with the first overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. | Question: Which St. Louis Rams season was the final full season played by the 2008 winner of the Heisman Trophy?", ['75th'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-3002'), ('Context: Located on the Niagara River , which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario , the combined falls form the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 165 feet ( 50 m ) .

The story deals with the gradually revealed histories of a critically burned English accented Hungarian man, his Canadian nurse, a Canadian-Italian thief, and an Indian sapper in the British Army as they live out the end of World War II in an Italian villa. The novel won the Canadian Governor General\'s Award and the Booker Prize for fiction. The novel was adapted into an award-winning film of the same name in 1996. The narrative is non-linear and the main characters are examined in depth and detail.  Contents  5 External links  \xa0 Plot summary  The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. In her care is the man nicknamed "the English patient," of whom all she knows is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. He also claimed to be English. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus \' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. The patient is, in fact, László de Almásy , a Hungarian desert explorer who was part of a British cartography group. He chose, however, to erase his identity and nationality.  Caravaggio, a Canadian who served in Britain\'s foreign intelligence service since the late 1930s, was a friend of Hana\'s father, who died in the war. Caravaggio, who entered the world of spying because of his skill as a thief, comes to the villa in search of Hana. He overheard in another hospital that she was there taking care of a burned patient. Caravaggio bears physical and psychological scars; he was deliberately left behind to spy on the German forces and was eventually caught, interrogated and tortured, his thumbs having been cut off. Seeking vengeance three years later, Caravaggio (like Almásy) is addicted to morphine, which Hana supplies.  One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordinance disposal. Kip explains that the Germans often booby-trapped musical instruments with bombs, and that he will stay in the villa to rid it of its dangers. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends.  Prompted to tell his story, the Patient begins to reveal all: An English gentleman, Geoffrey Clifton and his wife, Katharine, accompanied the patient\'s desert exploration team. The Patient\'s job was to draw maps of the desert, and the Cliftons\' plane made this job easier. Almásy fell in love with Katharine Clifton one night as she read from Herodotus\' histories aloud around a campfire. They soon began a very intense affair, but in 1938, Katharine cut it off, claiming that Geoffrey would go mad if he discovered them.  When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifton offered to pick up Almásy in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. However, Geoffrey turns around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured. Almásy took her to " the cave of swimmers ", a place the exploration team had previously discovered, and covered her with a parachute so he could leave to find help. After three days, he reached a town, but the British were suspicious of him because he was incoherent and had a foreign surname. They locked him up as a spy.

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel\'s periodical, the Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation. The deluxe illustrated edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871, included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou.  The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne\'s greatest works, along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth. The description of Nemo\'s ship, called the Nautilus, was considered ahead of its time, as it accurately describes features on submarines, which at the time were very primitive vessels. Thus, the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories, unlike some of Verne\'s other works, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels.  Title  The title refers to the distance traveled while under the sea and not to a depth, as 20,000 leagues is over six times the diameter, and nearly three times the circumference of the Earth.  The greatest depth mentioned in the book is four leagues.

A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: American car manufacturers Nash ( in 1949 ) and Ford ( in 1955 ) offered seat belts as options , while Swedish Saab first introduced seat belts as standard in 1958 .

I’m sure you’re all familiar with it by now, but if not, BendGate was created from an alleged bending issue with Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus.

Deigo Luna was so hot! This was not as good as the first, but considering it wasn\'t really a sequel but more like a completely different movie I thought it was awesome. The acting was good, the dancing awesome, and the soundtrack even better. I loved the dance they did at the Palace and I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Both the lead actors are new and I hope that we will be seeing a lot more of each of them. This is a sweet story of an interacial relationship in Cuba where the white girl from America falls in love with the sexy Cuban pool boy! They are so awesome together and it was a wonderful movie. With the sexy dancing and the sexy music and the typical(but good) storyline this is the perfect movie to watch anytime!  10/10  source  Very good movie8/10  I rented this movie the other day simply because I wanted to see how they could possibly do a sequel to the first Dirty Dancing. However, I don\'t think I would have otherwise. BUT I am really glad that I did. I loved this movie! I really liked the story line and it also gave me a brief glimpse of the history of Cuba. That in itself made it one of my new favorite movies. Combine this with the music and the awesome dancing and it becomes a fantastic movie. I am not going to compare it to the first DD movie. It deserves to be set out on it\'s own. It is definitely worthy. The young actors do an awesome job of portraying the characters in this movie. This is a movie that I would like to own and I don\'t feel that way about a lot of movies. Congratulations to the producers, directors and all of those involved, I will be recommending this one to friends and family.  source  I LOVED Dirty Dancing Havana Night\'s9/10  I loved this movie! It was really good. Yes it was a chick flick and a teen movie, but it was SO good and romantic! Javier (Luna) was SO hot and good. The way his body moved was amazing! The only reason I rated this movie a 9 was because I didn\'t like the way it ended. I thought it could have been done a little differently. But I still went out and bought the DVD!! This may sound a little crazy, but almost every night I watch it! If I could learn to dance the way they do...I would pay to learn how to dance so Cuban! It was a really good, adorable, romantic, and dramatic Movie. It had everything and more that I like to see in a movie. Many people say that they didn\'t like it but, I thought it was awesome.  source  Feel the rhythm of the beat!10/10  This movie is now without a doubt on my top 10 list now! The mix of drama, romance, history, and dance is perfect! The acting, dancing, and music in the movie was great! You want to just stand up and dance (even if you have no idea how to) Havana nights really takes you into the lives of these two people and makes you really care about them. It has an ending that is very true to real life. That things don\'t always go as they should. It had a Romeo and Juliet vibe without being cheesy what so ever. Diego and Romola give a heart warming performance that makes you always want to come back for more. I recommend this movie to anyone that has ever wanted to follow their dreams, but was too afraid to try.

As you are probably fully aware, the former indefinitely suspended quarterback had his suspension cut to the first two games of the 2009 NFL season by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for his actions related to his much publicized dogfighting case that cost him almost two years in a Leavenworth, Kansas prison.\xa0 \xa0  The July 2009 signing of the controversial quarterback by the Philadelphia Eagles, long known as a “High Character” team for years, was a total shock to Philly fans and media.\xa0 The signing fueled a firestorm of talk radio, chat room, and water cooler discussions everywhere, with the question of “Why bring in a distraction of this magnitude?”\xa0  However, after an initial fire storm of publicity about the signing—people saying they would turn in their season tickets, picketing threats, etc—Vick’s presence on the Eagles\' roster seemed to have been  minimized.\xa0 The former highest paid player in the NFL “quietly” went about his business of re-acclimating into the NFL as the Birds\' third or fourth quarterback.\xa0 Plus, doing some much needed PR work related to curbing dog fighting in urban communities.  There is no doubt that the Eagles went out on a limb to sign the infamous quarterback earlier this summer not as social commentary, but as an insurance policy.\xa0 And like it usually does, fate stepped in and any chances of the Eagles continuing to bring Vick along slowly were thrown out the door in Week one of the regular season.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0  Eagles\' starting quarterback Donovan McNabb was injured (broken rib) in a win over the Panthers . As McNabb laid on the ground, several eyes looked to Philadelphia Eagles Owner Jeff Lurie’s suite at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, NC.\xa0  You could almost hear, “Paging Michael Vick…Paging Michael Vick” through the television even though the former three-time Pro Bowl player was not eligible until Week three (KC Chiefs).\xa0  Well, week three of the NFL regular season is here, and Eagles head coach Andy Reid will probably be redeeming the Eagles’ Vick insurance policy as the team looks for a win before their bye week (week four).\xa0  McNabb’s rib injury has lingered, and Eagles fill-in starter Kevin Kolb played up and down in a lopsided loss to the New Orleans Saints in week two, so Vick better be ready for the heat of the NFL regular season.\xa0 If game preparations go as expected, look for Kolb to start, Vick to be the backup, and newly signed backup Jeff Garcia to be the “emergency” quarterback.\xa0  Vick—career passing numbers of 930-1730, 54 percent, 11505 yards, 71 TDs, 52 INTs | Question: What team does controversial quarterback Michael Vick play for in the National Football League in the USA?', ['philadelphia eagles'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-3213'), ('Context: Despite the common misconception , a public trust position is not a security clearance , and is not the same as the confidential designation .

The form used for the written profile is customised to meet specific requirements and can incorporate a photograph, company information, logo, appropriate picture, event title etc.. to promote the host company.  HANDWRITING is as unique as fingerprints and clearly reflects personal strengths, potential and innermost characteristics. No matter how hard we try, it is virtually impossible to conceal or disguise our personality by deliberately altering our handwriting.  A CHARACTER "READING" from handwriting is very personal; highly intriguing; and extremely popular. Few people (even those sceptical about graphology) can resist an opportunity to find out what a graphologist will tell them about themselves. Usually the analysis merely confirms what is known (or secretly suspected) but there is always the possibility of discovering something unexpected!  NORMA SWEETING is a professional graphologist. She has over ten year\'s experience of providing a range of graphology services from serious in-depth handwriting analysis for management appointments to light-hearted personality profiles for marketing and entertainment. She is also in demand as a speaker at meetings, conferences and for after-dinner entertainment. Her illustrated graphology lectures include full audience participation.  Graphology attracts interest and promotes business at:  Corporate hospitality & Entertainment  WHAT IS GRAPHOLOGY?  Graphology is the science of identifying personal strengths, aptitudes and inner needs from handwriting.  Although graphology is an age old concept, few people have personal experience of it. Given the opportunity, most people are eager to find out about what their handwriting says about them and intrigued to know how handwriting can reveal characteristics they thought were well hidden.  Handwriting is like body language. It speaks much louder than words. No matter how hard you try, it is almost impossible to conceal or disguise your handwriting for long.  Personality profiles are quick character snap-shots. They highlight the most prominent traits in a small handwriting sample.

Handwriting analysis is an effective and reliable indicator of                             personality and behaviour, and so is a useful tool for many organizational                             processes, for example: recruitment, interviewing and selection, team-building,                             counselling, and career-planning.

An important Great Lakes harbor, Green Bay is a port of entry, with heavy shipping and a large wholesale and jobbing trade. Its industries include papermaking, food and dairy processing, meatpacking, and auto part manufacture.  Jean Nicolet established a trading post on the site of Green Bay in 1634; many notable French explorers and missionaries followed. The permanent settlement, the oldest in the state, dates from 1701. The key to the Fox-Wisconsin water route and thus an entry to the Midwest, Green Bay became a fur-trading center and was occupied successively by the French (1717), the British (1761), and the Americans (1816). With the settlement of the Old Northwest after the War of 1812 and the decline of the fur trade, Green Bay became the trade center of a lumber and farm area.  Of interest are the National Railroad Museum and many historical buildings, including the Tank Cottage (1776). A branch of the Univ. of Wisconsin and a technical college are in the city, which is also the home of the Green Bay Packers professional football team.  The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.

Green Bay | Wisconsin, United States | Britannica.comGreen Bay | Wisconsin, United States | Britannica.com  Wisconsin, United States  Tony Shalhoub  Green Bay, city , seat (1854) of Brown county, eastern Wisconsin , U.S. It is situated where the Fox River empties into Green Bay (an inlet of Lake Michigan ), about 110 miles (180 km) north of Milwaukee . Green Bay’s metropolitan area includes the city of De Pere and the villages of Ashwaubenon, Howard, and Allouez.  Brown County Courthouse, Green Bay, Wis.  Royalbroil  Ho-Chunk Nation ( Winnebago ), Menominee , Fox , and Ojibwa Indians were early inhabitants of the region. The area was visited in 1634 by Jean Nicolet , a French explorer who named it La Baye Verte (“The Green Bay”) because of the greenish colour of the water. By 1655 a fur-trading post had been established, and Green Bay became the gateway to a trade route that connected the Fox, Wisconsin , and Mississippi rivers. In 1671 Claude-Jean Allouez , a Jesuit, founded a mission at De Pere, and two years later the French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet traveled through the bay and southward down the Fox on their journey to the Mississippi River. A fort built by the French (1717) at the mouth of the river became the heart of a small French Canadian fur-trading community until after the French and Indian War (1754–63), when the British took control of the area. British traders called the site Green Bay, and the French name was gradually dropped. The United States took possession after the War of 1812 and built Fort Howard (1816) within the present limits of Green Bay. The city was laid out in the 1830s, and Wisconsin’s earliest newspaper, the Green Bay Intelligencer, appeared in 1833. With the decline of the fur trade and the opening (1825) of the Erie Canal , Green Bay developed as a lumbering and agricultural centre.  Papermaking is a primary industry in Green Bay; other manufacturing (papermaking machinery, furniture, and packaging materials), food processing (meat, cheese and other dairy products, and vegetables), health care, insurance, agriculture (dairying), trucking, and tourism (a large casino is nearby) also contribute to the economy. A Great Lakes port of entry with heavy shipping, the city has a large wholesale and distributing business.

As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency , the Mint moved from London to a new 38 acres ( 15 ha ) plant in Llantrisant , Wales where it has remained since . | Question: when did the royal mint move to wales ?", ['the 1960s .'], 'mrqa_naturalquestions-validation-866'), ('Context: Deadliest commercial airline crashes in history - CNN.comDeadliest commercial airline crashes in history - CNN.com  Deadliest commercial airline crashes in history  By CNN Staff  Updated 9:50 AM ET, Sat March 15, 2014  Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

But on the other hand, it’s quite a chore to make a Cassata alla Siciliana and although Fabrizia Lanza sailed through it without breaking a sweat, between using the right pan, mixing up your own almond paste, finding ricotta as good as the ricotta in Sicily, and getting the candied fruit (including the squash, which is the translucent white brick on the platter), it might be classified as one of those things that’s better left to the Sicilians.  (Nevertheless, if you want to give it a go, Saveur printed her Cassata recipe, and it’s also in her book, Coming Home to Sicily . I linked to additional recipes at the end of the post.)  According to Italian food specialist Clifford A. Wright , the word Cassata is derived from the Arabic word quas’at, or qas’at, which refers to a wide bowl. There is actually a special pan to make the cake; it’s a mold with sloped sides and a groove around the bottom so that when Cassata mold is lined with strips of almond paste, and overturned, there’s a rim to create a neat guard against the icing from running down the sides.  I found out what the pan was for when I was making some pine nut praline for an ice cream I was going to churn up for her, made by caramelizing 1 part sugar then stirring in 1 part lightly toasted pine nuts, which get spread on a flat, greased surface, and left to cool. In my haste to find a flat pan in an unfamiliar kitchen, I grabbed one Fabrizia’s nice Cassata pans, as I was eyeing its flat, wide surface, perfect for spreading the praline.  I wasn’t able to find where, globally, you can get one online . But I did find some dynamite metal popsicle molds during my search.  Speaking of kitchen tools, I was wowed by this amazing, single-purpose Italian tool. When I asked Fabrizia where she got it, she replied, “In America.”  So somehow, people in the U.S. are able to roll the almond paste to fit snugly into the pan, but not actually find the right pan.  The first thing Fabrizia did was to make her own almond paste using finely ground almonds. Because I am a crunchy-granola California type, I asked if you could make the cake without the green food coloring.  Fabrizia laughed, but being Sicilian, she explained that Cassata is a cake for fun, festive occasions, and the vibrant green is part of the riot of colors that make the cake what it is meant to be. Although, perhaps bowing to overseas sensibilities, her mother, Anna Tasca Lanza said in one of her books that if you leave the green coloring out, you should pour the icing over the entire cake so that it hides the almond paste.  After cutting spongecake into strips to make a top layer for the cake, she whipped up a seriously good ricotta cream with the fresh sheeps’ milk ricotta we’d watched being made just the day before. Since she had a little extra, she tossed the bowl toward me with a spoon, and I dug right in.  Ladies and gentlemen, or signore e signori, no matter how far you are, if you are not booking a ticket to Sicily to taste sweetened sheeps’ milk ricotta cream, may the rest of your life be filled with neutral-colored almond paste. (ie: No fun at all.)  Because she knows that I love bergamots as much as she does, she doused the spongecake with homemade bergamot syrup, which gave me the idea to return in the winter, when the bergamot and citron trees are bearing fruit, and do some serious candying and syrup-making with her.

Olivier Py\'s staging, a coproduction with La Monnaie in Brussels, had its French premiere on March 14 at Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg, conducted by Daniele Callegari.  Py believes in this sprawling five-act opera, wholeheartedly embracing the work\'s libretto and its religious confrontation between Huguenots and Catholics. Pierre-André Weitz\'s raked metallic stage relied on strong lighting to make its points and was more evocative of a Py\xad–Weitz production than of any anecdotal historical backdrop. There were plenty of the director\'s familiar mannerisms to love or hate, including gratuitous nudity and an awkward exploration of physicality that would no doubt have surprised Meyerbeer and his librettist. Py is a consummate professional, however: it would be hard to imagine another director who could bring such playful dramatic energy to the work. The only added symbol, which could have been left to the audience\'s imagination, was the Holocaust reference at the moment of the final massacre of the Protestants.  The opera was composed in 1836, just seven years after Rossini\'s Guillaume Tell, and is a fascinating musical bridge between Rossini and the works of Verdi and Wagner. Verdi admired Meyerbeer, and there are rumbustious rataplan echoes in La Forza del Destino. Like Verdi, Meyerbeer writes music that blossoms from the workaday into the sublime, notably in the great Act IV duet between Valentine and Raoul. There are some clumsy musical effects, but Meyerbeer\'s striving for dramatic verisimilitude and grandeur is irresistibly forward-looking. Wagner could not have been insensitive to the fact that the musical driving force of the work is a prototype of a leitmotif, the Huguenot chorale "Ein\' feste Burg ist unser Gott" (A mighty fortress is our God).  One of the reasons for the scarcity of Huguenots revivals is the difficulty of the central tenor role, Raoul de Nangis— a part that was the property of Jean de Reszke, Caruso, Martinelli and Corelli. Initially, Gregory Kunde sounded defeated by the exposed "Plus blanche que la blanche hermine," accompanied by just a viola d\'amore, but he triumphed in the more dramatic music, singing tirelessly in commendably clear French. He was especially fine in duet with Mireille Delunsch\'s Valentine. Meyerbeer may stretch Delunsch\'s soprano resources, but she is a moving artist who brought a touching integrity to the role.\xa0  The best singing of the evening came from Karine Deshayes as the page Urbain; the French mezzo offered exemplary playful attack, perfect diction and exultant virtuosity. American soprano Laura Aikin was not far behind in terms of technical precision as Marguerite de Valois, a role that disappointingly fades away in Meyerbeer\'s opera. "Ô beau pays de la Touraine" was effortlessly dispatched, although a little less vocal discretion might have brought the house down. The great humanitarian outpourings of Raoul\'s servant Marcel were delivered with smooth bass tone by Wojtek Smilek in rather curious French, unlike that of baritone Marc Barrard, as the Comte de Nevers, whose diction and style remain impeccable. Philippe Rouillon\'s straight-voiced baritone rode over the orchestra with implacable force as Comte de Saint-Bris, while his two tenor sons, Xavier and Arnaud, creditably took on the roles of Cossé and Retz.\xa0  Callegari conducted the marathon four and a half hours with growing authority after some rocky ensemble at the beginning of the evening. This was not the subtlest of readings, but it was one with its heart in the right place, with a correct singer-friendly balance. With lusty singing from the Strasbourg chorus and some fine brass in the orchestra, the work moved forward with irresistible force and a typical Gallic mix of humor and tragedy.\xa0  \xa0  The Huguenots - Meyerbeer - Music With EaseThe Huguenots - Meyerbeer  The Huguenots  (French title: Les Huguenots)  An Opera by Jakob Meyerbeer  This opera was first produced at the Académie, Paris, on February 29, 1836 | Question: Who composed the opera The Huguenots?', ['meyerbeer'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5580'), ("Context: The 40th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 40 degrees north of the Earth 's equatorial plane .

His many roles included Squadron Leader Peter Carter in A Matter of Life and Death , Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days , and Sir Charles Lytton, (“the Phantom”) in The Pink Panther . He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Separate Tables (1958).  Born in London, Niven attended Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe before gaining a place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst . After Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and was gazetted a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry . Having developed an interest in acting , he left the Highland Light Infantry, travelled to Hollywood , and had several minor roles in film. He first appeared as an extra in the British film There Goes the Bride (1932). From there, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films from 1933 to 1935, including a non-speaking part in MGM ‘s Mutiny on the Bounty . This brought him to wider attention within the film industry and he was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn . Upon the outbreak of the Second World War , Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being recommissioned as a lieutenant .  Niven resumed his acting career after his demobilisation , and was voted the second-most popular British actor in the 1945 Popularity Poll of British film stars. He appeared in A Matter of Life and Death (1946), The Bishop’s Wife (1947), and Enchantment (1948), all of which received critical acclaim. Niven later appeared in The Elusive Pimpernel (1950), The Toast of New Orleans (1950), Happy Go Lovely (1951), Happy Ever After (1954) and Carrington V.C. (1955) before scoring a big success as Phileas Fogg in Michael Todd ‘s production of Around the World in 80 Days (1956). Niven appeared in nearly a hundred films, and many shows for television. He also began writing books, with considerable commercial success. In 1982 he appeared in Blake Edwards ‘ final “Pink Panther” films Trail of the Pink Panther and Curse of the Pink Panther , reprising his role as Sir Charles Lytton.  Contents  10 External links  Early life  James David Graham Niven was born in Belgrave Mansions , London, to William Edward Graham Niven (1878–1915) and his wife, Henrietta Julia (née Degacher) Niven. [3] He was named David for his birth on St. David’s Day (1 March) . Niven often claimed that he was born in Kirriemuir , in the Scottish county of Angus in 1909, but his birth certificate shows this was not the case. [4]  Henrietta was of French and British ancestry. She was born in Wales , the daughter of army officer William Degacher (1841–1879) by his marriage to Julia Caroline Smith, the daughter of Lieutenant General James Webber Smith. Niven’s grandfather William Degacher was killed in the Battle of Isandlwana (1879), during the Zulu War . [5] [6] Born William Hitchcock, he and his brother Henry had followed the lead of their father, Walter Henry Hitchcock, in assuming their mother’s maiden name of Degacher in 1874. [7]  William Niven, David’s father, was of Scottish descent; his paternal grandfather, David Graham Niven, (1811–1884) was from St. Martin’s, a village in Perthshire . William served in the Berkshire Yeomanry in the First World War and was killed during the Gallipoli Campaign on 21 August 1915. He was buried in Green Hill Cemetery , Turkey, in the Special Memorial Section in Plot F. 10. [8]  Niven’s mother remarried, to Sir Thomas Comyn-Platt, in London in 1917.

Many, it not all, actors view an Oscar as both a sign of acceptance of their peers and an opportunity to increase their clout when negotiating deals to star in future pictures.  A primary example of this move would be Tom Hanks . Hanks had been attempting to make the leap from comic actor to major dramatic star, and his role in Philadelphia , the first Hollywood picture to deal with AIDS , earned him a best actor Oscar in 1993. But it was Hanks\' role as the title character in his follow-up movie, Forrest Gump , that would cement him as one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. The character of Forrest Gump was one of a good-hearted simpleton whose dimwitted perspective of many of the major events of the sixties, seventies and eighties captivated audiences and earned Hanks his second Oscar in two years.  However Hanks was not the first actor to benefit from playing a intellectually-challenged character. In 1968 Cliff Robertson won Best Actor in the title role of Charly , a typically naive 60s film that has dated badly and rarely appears on tv. The Virgin Film Guide describes the film as  "Reeking with its own brand of sleazy sincerity and desperately wanting to be profound about something, Charly is more than capable of insulting both the mentally handicapped and anyone who cares about them."  In more recent times, the Hollywood movie machine has attempted to be less crass in the celluloid depiction of the mentally disabled. In 1988, Dustin Hoffman gained praise and won an Oscar for his portrayal of an autistic resident of a home for the mentally disabled in Rain Man , and Geoffrey Rush also won for Shine in 199 where he played a child prodigy pianist who suffers a nervous breakdown and is institutionalized. Again this is not a purely recent phenonenom. Back in 1957 the best actress Oscar went to Joanne Woodward for her role as a schizophrenic in the psychological thriller, The Three Faces of Eve , another film that has dated with its simplistic view of Woodward\'s condition.  Portrayals of physical disabilities are also always good for a punt come Oscar time. The first star to benefit from this was Jane Wyman in 1948, who won best actress for her performance as a deaf mute in Johnny Belinda . Wyman\'s performance was a worthy winner, and in order to fine-tune her performance for this important role she stuffed her ears with wax, impairing her hearing against all but the loudest of beats. The 1986 film Children of a Lesser God also required a deaf lead actress, but this time instead of casting one of Hollywood\'d best and brightest, Marlee Matlin an actual deaf actress was used. The film, a love story, was a success and Matlin was rewarded for her expressive silent acting with an Oscar statuette of her own.  Other stars to win an Oscar for the portrayal of disabled characters are Jon Voight who won for his role as a Vietnam veteran and paraplegic in Coming Home , and Daniel Day-Lewis who played the artist and writer Christy Brown who overcame a devastating case of cerebral palsy in the 1989 film My Left Foot . In 1992, Al Pacino had yet to  win an Oscar, despite being nominated previously for the likes of the Godfather movies, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon . His role as the blind ex-army officer in Scent of a Woman would finally win the award for Pacino, despite the short-comings of a hammy, sentimental script.

Rebecca. London: Victor Gollancz, 1938. Octavo, original black cloth gilt, original dust jacket. Housed in custom clamshell box.  First edition of du Maurier’s most famous novel, her haunting tale of memory and murder, the basis for Alfred Hitchcock’s Oscar-winning 1940 film. An exceptional copy in scarce original dust jacket, with original Book Society belly band.  Du Maurier’s most popular novel, and one that paved the way for a renaissance of romantic mystery in mid-20th century publishing, Rebecca “subtly subverts the classic rags-to-riches or Cinderella theme to provide an eerie… almost Gothic narrative” (Parker & Kermode, 211). The novel proved to critics that “Du Maurier is in a class by herself” (New York Times); her “masterful treatment” of her tale“made Rebecca a classic book” (Steinbrunner & Penzler, 136). “‘Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.’ The opening line of perhaps the greatest romantic suspense novel ever written has become as familiar to readers as ‘Call me Ishmael’ from Moby-Dick” (Penzler, Crown, 26). Singled out by Haycraft Queen as a Cornerstone mystery, Rebecca has also been chosen by the Mystery Writers of America as number nine in the Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time. Hubin, 128.

It was the most serious scandal in the country’s history prior to the Watergate affair of the Nixon administration in the 1970s.  And this controversy was named for an oil reserve near a rock formation north of Casper , Wyo., that looked just like a teapot.  Events that led to the scandal began decades before when government and U.S. Navy officials, contemplating a new, global presence, realized they needed a fuel supply that was more reliable and more portable than coal .  During the Theodore Roosevelt presidency early in the 20th century, Department of the Navy officials aspired for an American navy that could sail all the world’s oceans, demonstrating the country’s newly found imperial powers. The U. S. Navy, bound by weight limitations with coal-fired ships, resorted to building coal-fueling stations around the world.  They watched carefully as other nations began development of petroleum-powered ships. Beginning in 1909, during the Taft administration, Navy administrators decided to convert the fleet to the more efficient petroleum. Ships would have no need for coaling stations. Once fueled, the petroleum-powered ships had far greater range.  The USS Wyoming , a battleship initially launched in 1900, became the first ship in the fleet to be converted to oil power in 1909. (The vessel was later renamed the USS Cheyenne when the new battleship USS Wyoming was launched in 1910.), As more ships were converted from coal, Navy officials grew more concerned about the long-term availability of oil. What would happen if oil were to run out? The Navy would be paralyzed.  Consequently, Navy administrators asked Congress to set aside federally owned lands in places where known oil deposits most likely existed. These “naval petroleum reserves” would not be drilled unless a national emergency made it necessary. One of the three petroleum reserves set aside was near Salt Creek in northern Natrona County in a place named for an unusual rock formation nearby—Teapot Dome. A dome is a geological formation that traps oil underground between impervious layers of rock, with the upper layer bent upward to form a dome.  Oilmen throughout the West coveted the opportunity to drill within these federally owned reserves. Soon after Republican Warren G. Harding was elected president in 1920, he appointed his poker-playing friend, U.S. Sen. Albert Fall, to be his secretary of Interior.  Fall, a rancher and New Mexico’s first U.S. senator, accepted the cabinet post. Within a few weeks, he convinced President Harding to allow transfer of the naval petroleum reserves from the Navy to the Department of the Interior, arguing that the department was “better able” to oversee the protection of these areas where oil was not to be produced, but kept in case of emergency.  What resulted became known as the Teapot Dome scandal, but even though the scandal gained its name from a Wyoming place, the wrongdoers were from elsewhere.  Secretary Fall, once the Teapot Dome oil field was under his control, made secret deals with two prominent oilmen, Edward Doheny and Harry Sinclair. Both men, close friends of Fall, paid him bribes to authorize them to drill in the three naval petroleum reserves—contrary to the letter and spirit of the law.  Back in Wyoming, independent oilman and later, Democratic Wyoming Gov. Leslie Miller became suspicious when he saw trucks with the Sinclair company logo hauling drilling equipment into the Teapot Dome naval petroleum reserve. He asked U.S. Sen. John B. Kendrick , also a Democrat, to look into the matter. Kendrick, sensing wrongdoing, turned the question over to a special Senate investigating committee.  Meanwhile, President Harding took a summer trip west, stopping in Wyoming, enjoying Yellowstone and continuing on to Alaska and, eventually, to San Francisco. While there, the President died suddenly.

The ficus religiosa, Bodhi tree, has large heart shaped leaves. It is one of the most sacred trees in India, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it is venerated by both Hindus and Buddhists. The tree under which Siddhartha Gautama gained enlightenment over 2,600 years ago still grows today in North East India.  In Hindu religion, Vishnu is said to have been born under a Bodhi tree and is often depicted sitting on its heart-shaped leaves. The Bodhi tree is often planted in the grounds of temples and, of all the sacred trees of India, it is the most widely worshiped.  The Bodhi tree in Sri Lanka is located in Anuradhapura and is said to be the oldest tree in the world with a known planting date.

It is the place where Prince Siddhartha Guatama, while meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.  Traditional accounts say that, in the early years of the 4th century BC, Siddhartha Gautama saw the suffering of the world and wanted to be free from it. As a young man, following the ancient traditions of Hinduism, he sought out spiritual teachers. Inquiring of their knowledge, he diligently practiced various yogas and meditations. Seven years passed, the last three in extreme asceticism, yet still he had not achieved his goal of enlightenment.  Impression of Buddha feet, Bodh Gaya \xa0\xa0\xa0  Siddhartha then journeyed toward the ancient sacred forests of Uruvela (modern Gaya in Bihar, in north India) with the intention of finally and completely realizing the infinite. Guided by visionary dreams and following in the footsteps of the Buddhas of three previous ages, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni and Kasyapa (who had each attained enlightenment at the site) Siddhartha sat beneath the Bodhi Tree. Touching the earth, thereby calling it to witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment, he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.  "Here on this seat my body may shrivel up, my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve, but my body will not move from this seat until I have attained Enlightenment, so difficult to obtain in the course of great periods of time".  As Siddhartha sat in deep meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree, Mara, the Dark Lord of Death, came to distract him from his endeavor. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama\'s words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Siddhartha\'s wisdom broke through Mara’s illusions. The power of his compassion transformed the demons\' weapons into flowers and Mara and all his forces fled. Three days and nights passed and Siddhartha’s intention was realized.

The\xa0decathlon\xa0is a\xa0 combined event \xa0in\xa0 athletics \xa0consisting of ten\xa0 track and field \xa0events. The word decathlon is of Greek origin (from ???? deka [ten] and ????? athlos [contest]). Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved.\xa0The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the\xa0 heptathlon .  Traditionally, the title of “World’s Greatest Athlete” has been given to the man who wins the decathlon. This began when King\xa0 Gustav V of Sweden \xa0told\xa0 Jim Thorpe , “You, sir, are the world’s greatest athlete” after Thorpe won the decathlon at the\xa0 Stockholm Olympics \xa0in 1912.\xa0The current holder of the title is American\xa0 Bryan Clay , the gold medal winner of the event at the 2008\xa0 Beijing Olympics , who took the title from\xa0 Athens Olympics \xa0Czech champion\xa0 Roman Šebrle .  The event developed from the ancient\xa0 pentathlon . Pentathlon competitions were held at the\xa0 ancient Greek Olympics . Pentathlons involved five disciplines –\xa0 long jump ,\xa0 discus throw ,\xa0 javelin throw ,\xa0 sprint \xa0and a wrestling \xa0match. [4] \xa0Introduced in Olympia during 708 BC, the competition was extremely popular for many centuries. By the 6th century BC, pentathlons had become part of religious games. The\xa0 Amateur Athletic Union \xa0held “all around events” from the 1880s and a decathlon first appeared on the\xa0 Olympic athletics program \xa0at the\xa0 1904 Games .  Format  Men’s decathlon  The vast majority of international and top level men’s decathlons are divided in to a two-day competition, with the\xa0 track and field \xa0events held in the order below. Traditionally, all decathletes who finished the event do a round of honour together after the competition, rather than just the winner or medalling athletes.  Day 1  1500 metres  Women’s decathlon  At major championships, the women’s equivalent of the decathlon is the seven-event\xa0 heptathlon ; prior to 1981 it was the five-event\xa0 pentathlon .\xa0However, in 2001 the\xa0 IAAF \xa0approved scoring tables for women’s decathlon; the current world record holder is\xa0 Austra Skujyt? \xa0of\xa0 Lithuania .\xa0Women’s disciplines differ from men’s in the same way as for standalone events: the shot, discus and javelin weigh less, and the sprint hurdles uses lower hurdles over 100 m rather than 110 m. The points tables used are the same as for the heptathlon in the shared events. The schedule of events differs from the men’s decathlon, with the field events switched between day one and day two; this is to avoid scheduling conflicts when men’s and women’s decathlon competitions take place simultaneously.  Day 1  DecathlonThe decathlon is a combined event in athletics consisting of ten track and field events. The word decathlon is of Greek origin, from δέκα (déka, meaning "ten") and ἄθλος (áthlos, or ἄθλον, áthlon, meaning "feat"). Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon.  Traditionally, the title of "World\'s Greatest Athlete" has been given to the man who wins the Olympic decathlon. This began when King Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe, "You, sir, are the world\'s greatest athlete" after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912.

Cyclops  The Cyclops, a fabulous race of one-eyed giants, were initially regarded as creative craftsmen who helped Hephaistos in his volcanic forge, crafting special armor, such as Hades\' invisable helmet, Zeus\' thunderbolt and Poseidon\'s trident. These earlier Cyclopes were said to have built the "cyclopean" fortifications at Tiryns and Mycenae in the Peloponnese.  Yet, later on, they were also portrayed as moody, rebellious shepherds who ignored devine laws and prayed on mortals.  \xa0  Polyphemus  Polyphemus was the son of Poseidon and the sea nymph Thoosa. He was a Cyclops and was thought to have lived on the island of Sicily. The celebrated traveller, Odysseus, renowned for his wits and silver-tongue, was on his way home from Troy when he beach at Sicily, home of the lawless race of one-eyed giants. He asked for hospitality and called himself by the name of Nobody.  Polyphemus indeed proved to be a dangerous host and treated the Greeks as part of his flock, shutting them up in his cave and eating them one by one for his evening meal. Odysseus dared not kill the Cyclops during the night because his men lacked the strength to move the boulder blocking the cave entrance. So Odysseus thought of a cunning plan to enable their escape. By getting Polyphemus drunk Odysseus was able to put out the giants single eye with the strike of a stake. The injured Polyphemus roared with pain, but in responce to the other Cyclops\' questions he cried out that he was being attacked by Nobody, so they went away, considering him drunk or mad. In the morning Polyphemus opened the cave to let out his flock and felt the back of each animal as it passed to ensure no men escaped. But Odysseus and his men tied themselves to the undersides of the sheep and managed to leave undetected. For his crime against his son, Poseidon promised revenge on Odysseus.

Olivier Py\'s staging, a coproduction with La Monnaie in Brussels, had its French premiere on March 14 at Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg, conducted by Daniele Callegari.  Py believes in this sprawling five-act opera, wholeheartedly embracing the work\'s libretto and its religious confrontation between Huguenots and Catholics. Pierre-André Weitz\'s raked metallic stage relied on strong lighting to make its points and was more evocative of a Py\xad–Weitz production than of any anecdotal historical backdrop. There were plenty of the director\'s familiar mannerisms to love or hate, including gratuitous nudity and an awkward exploration of physicality that would no doubt have surprised Meyerbeer and his librettist. Py is a consummate professional, however: it would be hard to imagine another director who could bring such playful dramatic energy to the work. The only added symbol, which could have been left to the audience\'s imagination, was the Holocaust reference at the moment of the final massacre of the Protestants.  The opera was composed in 1836, just seven years after Rossini\'s Guillaume Tell, and is a fascinating musical bridge between Rossini and the works of Verdi and Wagner. Verdi admired Meyerbeer, and there are rumbustious rataplan echoes in La Forza del Destino. Like Verdi, Meyerbeer writes music that blossoms from the workaday into the sublime, notably in the great Act IV duet between Valentine and Raoul. There are some clumsy musical effects, but Meyerbeer\'s striving for dramatic verisimilitude and grandeur is irresistibly forward-looking. Wagner could not have been insensitive to the fact that the musical driving force of the work is a prototype of a leitmotif, the Huguenot chorale "Ein\' feste Burg ist unser Gott" (A mighty fortress is our God).  One of the reasons for the scarcity of Huguenots revivals is the difficulty of the central tenor role, Raoul de Nangis— a part that was the property of Jean de Reszke, Caruso, Martinelli and Corelli. Initially, Gregory Kunde sounded defeated by the exposed "Plus blanche que la blanche hermine," accompanied by just a viola d\'amore, but he triumphed in the more dramatic music, singing tirelessly in commendably clear French. He was especially fine in duet with Mireille Delunsch\'s Valentine. Meyerbeer may stretch Delunsch\'s soprano resources, but she is a moving artist who brought a touching integrity to the role.\xa0  The best singing of the evening came from Karine Deshayes as the page Urbain; the French mezzo offered exemplary playful attack, perfect diction and exultant virtuosity. American soprano Laura Aikin was not far behind in terms of technical precision as Marguerite de Valois, a role that disappointingly fades away in Meyerbeer\'s opera. "Ô beau pays de la Touraine" was effortlessly dispatched, although a little less vocal discretion might have brought the house down. The great humanitarian outpourings of Raoul\'s servant Marcel were delivered with smooth bass tone by Wojtek Smilek in rather curious French, unlike that of baritone Marc Barrard, as the Comte de Nevers, whose diction and style remain impeccable. Philippe Rouillon\'s straight-voiced baritone rode over the orchestra with implacable force as Comte de Saint-Bris, while his two tenor sons, Xavier and Arnaud, creditably took on the roles of Cossé and Retz.\xa0  Callegari conducted the marathon four and a half hours with growing authority after some rocky ensemble at the beginning of the evening. This was not the subtlest of readings, but it was one with its heart in the right place, with a correct singer-friendly balance. With lusty singing from the Strasbourg chorus and some fine brass in the orchestra, the work moved forward with irresistible force and a typical Gallic mix of humor and tragedy.\xa0  \xa0  The Huguenots - Meyerbeer - Music With EaseThe Huguenots - Meyerbeer  The Huguenots  (French title: Les Huguenots)  An Opera by Jakob Meyerbeer  This opera was first produced at the Académie, Paris, on February 29, 1836 | Question: Who composed the opera The Huguenots?', ['meyerbeer'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5580'), ('Context: Australian rules football was invented in Melbourne , Australia , in 1858 .

He also hosted the original version of the talent show Star Search from 1983 to 1995. He co-hosted TV\'s Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998. He also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House).    McMahon annually co-hosted the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon. In the 1970s and 1980s, he anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network\'s coverage of the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. McMahon appeared in several films, including The Incident, Fun With Dick and Jane, Full Moon High, and Butterfly, as well as briefly in the film version of Bewitched. He also performed in numerous television commercials.  According to Entertainment Weekly, McMahon is considered one of the greatest "sidekicks".Ben Schott, Schott\'s Mischellany Calendar 2009 (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008)  Early years  McMahon was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon, Sr., a fund-raiser and entertainer, and his wife Eleanor (Russell) McMahon.  He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. McMahon began his career as a bingo caller in Maine when he was fifteen. Prior to this, he worked as a carnival barker for three years in Mexico, Maine. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. His first broadcasting job was at WLLH-AM in his native Lowell and he began his television career in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.  Military service  McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, however, both the Army and Navy required two years of college for their pilots program. McMahon enrolled into classes at Boston College and studied there from 1940–41.  On the Howard Stern Show in 2001 McMahon stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement was not lifted and he still had too finish his two years of college before applying for Marine flight training.  After completing the college requirement McMahon was able to enlist as he previously wished.  His primary flight training was in Dallas, followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan\'s surrender unconditionally.  As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. This time, he flew the OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog), an unarmed single-engine spotter plane. He functioned as an artillery spotter for the Marine batteries on the ground and as a forward controller for the Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines, as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel. In 1982 he received a state commission as a brigadier general in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.

Over the centuries, a geocentric view of the universe — with Earth at the center of everything — gave way to the proper understanding we have today of an expanding universe in which our galaxy is but one of billions. On this list are some of the most famous scientists from the early days of astronomy through the modern era, and a summary of some of their achievements.  Any list of famous astronomers has to include a varied collection of great scientists from the Greeks to the modern era, big thinkers who tackled many fields as well as modern astronomers who made significant discoveries and helped popularize astronomy.

Credit: Bartolomeu Velho, Public Domain  When most people believed the world was flat, the notable Greek mathematician, astronomer and geographer Eratosthenes (276 BCE- 195 BCE) used the sun to measure the size of the round Earth. His measurement of 24,660 miles (39,690 kilometers) was only 211 miles (340 km) off the true measurement.  The ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (AD 90- 168) set up a model of the solar system in which the sun, stars, and other planets revolved around Earth. Known as the Ptolemaic system, it remained in place for hundreds of years, though it turned out to be flat wrong.  Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986), known as Azophi to Westerners, made the first known observation of a group of stars outside of the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy.  Nicolaus Copernicus  Credit: Public Domain  In 16th century Poland, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a model of the solar system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. The model wasn't completely correct, as astronomers of the time struggled with the backwards path Mars sometimes took, but it eventually changed the way many scientists viewed the solar system.  Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles but in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today.  Galileo Galilei is credited with discovering the first four moons of Jupiter.  Credit: NASA  Born in Italy, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is often credited with the creation of the optical telescope, though in truth he improved on existing models. The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) turned the new observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons), as well as the rings of Saturn. Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. Galileo is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.  Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomena that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the first observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its moon, Titan.  Building on the work of those who had gone before him, English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws.

Have you even heard of it? Whenever we hear about yogurt, the first thing that comes to mind is the white creamy dairy product that contains live and active cultures. It is often mixed with various kinds of fruits and comes with a sweet taste. But there is also a new type of yogurt that is available today called Greek Yogurt!  So what is Greek yogurt actually? First, Greek yogurt is a yogurt that is increasingly gaining popularity across the country. People love it for its distinctive taste and great health benefits. Greek yogurt is special. It is as thick as sour cream and carries a uniquely tangy flavor, and it contains significantly more protein and less sugar content than a regular yogurt.  Although Greek Yogurt may seem fairly recent, it has in fact been around for thousands of years. Originally known as labneh or strained yogurt, it was a staple in many countries across the Mediterranean region. While the yogurt is popularly named after Greek, Greece isn’t the only country with the culture of making this thick and rich yogurt. The synonymous name of Greek Yogurt is started with Fage, a brand name by a Greek owned company that makes Total Greek Yogurt, which later set the craze in the United States when everyone is passionate about healthy Mediterranean diets.  What Is Greek Yogurt Compared To Regular Yogurt?  While both Greek Yogurt and regular yogurt are made from pasteurized milks, they differ in the way they are processed. Basically, cream from the milk is removed and then bacteria are added to convert the milk lactose into lactic acid. This is how yogurt is made, but to make ‘Greek Style’ yogurt, an additional straining process of removing whey is made. The removal of whey also reduces the amount of carbohydrates as well as sugar content in the yogurt.  Also unlike typical American style yogurt, the milk that is used is made thicker by either boiling off some of the water content, or by adding powdered milk and butter fat to make it more concentrated. This is what makes Greek yogurt creamier and contains higher level of protein and fat.  It usually takes up to 3 pounds of milk to make a single pound of Greek yogurt. This is a reason why Greek Yogurt is more expensive than regular yogurt. It is not even surprising to see Greek yogurt costs up to three times as much.  While generally Greek Yogurt is a healthier choice, you do need to read the label carefully before purchasing one. Since you already know what is Greek yogurt made from, the thicker Greek Yogurt normally contains higher amount of calories and fat than a regular cup of traditional yogurt.

In the dRVVT assay , low , rate - limiting concentrations of both Russell 's viper venom and phospholipid are used to give a standard clotting time of 23 to 27 seconds . This makes the test sensitive to the presence of lupus anticoagulants , because these antibodies interfere with the clot - promoting role of phospholipid in vitro , and their presence results in a prolonged clotting time . A mixing study is then performed , which consists of adding an equal volume of the patient 's plasma to normal plasma ; in this study , one would expect the clotting time to return to the normal range if there was only a deficiency of coagulation factors alone . A prolonged clotting time of 30 seconds or greater that does not correct despite the mixing study suggests the presence of a lupus anticoagulant . An abnormal result for the initial dRVVT assay should be followed by a dRVVT confirmatory test . In this test , the inhibitory effect of lupus anticoagulants on phospholipids in the dRVVT can be overcome by adding an excess of phospholipid to the assay .

In general , a ratio of greater than 1.3 is considered a positive result and implies that the patient may have antiphospholipid antibodies .

This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will, which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus (1524). Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul\'s epistle to the Ephesians 2:8–10. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith. "That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law," he wrote. "Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ." Faith, for Luther, was a gift from God; the experience of being justified by faith was "as though I had been born again." His entry into Paradise, no less, was a discovery about "the righteousness of God" – a discovery that "the just person" of whom the Bible speaks (as in Romans 1:17) lives by faith.

His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing "bad medicine" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle.

Spike is a general entertainment channel featuring a mix of various programs and movies, primarily oriented towards a male audience.  Spike\'s programming reaches approximately 98.7 million pay television subscribers in the United States   as well as Canada. As of 2006, Spike\'s viewers were almost half women (45%), although many of them are reported to be watching it with male partners or family members, or were watching the CSI franchise.  The average age of the channel\'s viewers was 42 years old.  As of February 2015, approximately 93.4 million households in the U.S. (80% of those with television) receive Spike.   Precursors  The Nashville Network era (1983–2000)  Spike was launched on March 7, 1983 as The Nashville Network, a country living and country music-themed television channel that originally operated as a joint venture of WSM, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Life and Accident Insurance Company) and Group W Satellite Communications. TNN operated from the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park near Nashville, Tennessee. Country Music Television (CMT), founded by Glenn D. Daniels, beat TNN\'s launch by two days, robbing them of the claim of the "first country music cable television network." TNN\'s flagship shows included Nashville Now, The Statler Brothers Show, American Sports Cavalcade and Grand Ole Opry Live. Nashville Now and the Grand Ole Opry were broadcast live from Opryland USA.    The Gaylord Entertainment Company purchased TNN and the Opryland properties in the latter half of 1987. Much of TNN\'s programming (except for its sports) during the Gaylord era was originally produced by Opryland Productions, also owned by Gaylord Entertainment.  From 1983 to 1992, all of TNN\'s auto racing and motor sports coverage was produced by Diamond P Sports. Starting in 1993, TNN started having its NASCAR coverage produced by World Sports Enterprises, and the American Speed Association coverage produced by Group 5 Sports, while Diamond P continued to produce most of the rest of the racing coverage. Programming included variety shows, talk shows, game shows, outdoor shows (such as hunting and fishing), and lifestyle shows; all centered in some way around country music or the country style of living.   Some of TNN\'s popular on-air talent included local Nashville media personalities Ralph Emery,  Dan Miller, Charlie Chase and Lorianne Crook, as well as established stars such as country music singer Bill Anderson and actresses Florence Henderson and Dinah Shore. By 1995, TNN was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which had recently acquired CBS around that time; two years later, Westinghouse bought CMT, TNN\'s chief competitor. In 1998, the channel dropped its "The Nashville Network" moniker and shortened its official name to TNN. Ownership shifted to Viacom in the late 1990s after its acquisition of CBS Corporation, Westinghouse\'s successor.  TNN subsequently relocated its headquarters to New York City from Nashville and was folded into Viacom\'s MTV Networks division.  The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–03)  On September 25, 2000, Viacom, sensing redundancy among TNN and CMT when it merged them into its MTV Networks unit, decided to refocus TNN, and in the process, the channel dramatically scaled back its country-western programs and changed its name to The National Network.  The network\'s name change also triggered a significant programming change in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience than the channel\'s original rural/working-class Southern demographic. This change was catalyzed by Viacom\'s acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE) programming, including its flagship show RAW Is War.

She performed professionally in London before joining Les Ballets Russes in 1923.  After she left Les Ballets Russes in 1925, de Valois established a private dance studio in London and started a ballet company. The Vic-Wells Ballet changed names numerous times before becoming the Royal Ballet, one of the world\'s leading classical ballet companies. De Valois started a second ballet company in 1946 that is now located in Birmingham and called the Birmingham Royal Ballet.  In addition to her numerous administrative and teaching duties, de Valois choreographed several works, including The Rake\'s Progress (1935), The Prospect Before Us (1940) and a version of Don Quixote (1950). Her talent for launching national dance companies extended beyond Britain. She was instrumental in recommending Celia Franca for the position of founding artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada . In 1956, de Valois became the founding director of the Turkish State Ballet.  Although she officially retired from her position as artistic director of the Royal Ballet in 1963, de Valois remained on faculty at the Royal Ballet School for a number of years.  De Valois was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1951.  Websites:  Royal Ballet  Learn more:  De Valois, Ninette. Come Dance with Me. [1957] Dublin: Lilliput, 1992. ---. Invitation to the Dance.

"It must be Madam," said those of us who could not see her, and everyone spontaneously rose to applaud the fragile, white-haired figure who had been wheeled to her place at the side of the stalls circle.  Madam it was. Dame Ninette de Valois, who has died aged 102, had made it, as she had made it almost every year, to see the student dancers who would carry forward the work she had started so many years ago - the tiny enterprise that was to grow into the whole edifice of the Royal Ballet and its school.  Earlier that year, on February 20, she had made it to Covent Garden for the 50th anniversary of the reopening of the Royal Opera House in 1946 with her company\'s production of The Sleeping Beauty. And she had come on stage for a standing ovation, led by the Queen from the royal box.  She was also at Sadler\'s Wells that year for the final gala there, before the demolition of the theatre where her company had started. Far from being sentimental or nostalgic, Dame Ninette, although she never ceased to recognise the vital part which that theatre, thanks to Lilian Baylis, had played in the foundation of British ballet, knew it was time for rebuilding and lent her blessing to the enterprise.

They originated on the planet of Mondas , which was at one time the tenth planet in our solar system .  It was described as being a twin planet of Earth .  At this point they were not androids.  Instead they were humans , or at least very similar to humans.  For some reason Mondas gradually moved further away from the sun , and eventually became free of the solar system millenia ago.  Because of this relocation, the planet became colder and colder, and the inhabitants had to resort to desparate measures in order to survive .  They perfected the art of cybernetics , and began replacing parts of their bodies with robotics .  At first they only did this with their limbs , but eventually they moved to their organs , nervous system , and eventually even their brains .  In the end they had completely eliminated any of their original biological components.  Unfortunately this included such things as emotions .  Survival became their only goal, and relentless logic their only way of thinking.  They\'ve threatened the human race several times.  They wish to capture humans and convert them into cybermen, and they want to exploit the Earth for its natural resources .  Fortunately the Doctor has thwarted them at every turn.  In their first encounter with the Doctor (in the episode The Tenth Planet ), not only did they not succeed in conquering the Earth, but they managed to get Mondas blown up in the process.  They relocated to a planet called Telos after they lost their home world.  The natives of Telos, the Cryons , were not happy about this.  For some reason the cybermen constructed a tomb for themselves there, but it wasn\'t a normal sort of tomb, because people were able to awaken them and bring them back into action.  Cybermen are humanoid , but would not be mistaken for a human being .  They are silver or grey , and have definite robotic features.  Over the years, their appearance changed.  In their early episodes , they looked a bit like humans wearing silver cloth, with a few other robotic features added.  Later on they looked more like "real" androids.  The cybermen are extremely strong , but they do not move very quickly.  Watching them cross any sort of distance is quite painful.  Their primary weakness is gold .  Particularly gold dust .  When it is put in their chest plates, it is fatal.  A weapon called the glitter gun was sometimes used to launch the gold dust into their chest plates.  The cybermen are usually led by a cyberman called the Cybercontroller .  Usually the Cybercontroller is larger than the other cybermen, and may have slightly different coloring to indicate rank .  The cybermats were small, mechanical creatures used by the cybermen.  They were grey or silver, and looked a little like rodents or like crustaceans .  They were about the size of a rat .  They have been known to inject poison , fire lasers , and make use of some sort of telepathy , depending on the episode.  The cybermen had cameo appearances in a number of episodes, but they made major appearances in the following:  Tue Feb 25 2003 at 14:15:41  \'Imagine that you can live forever and life is totally free from pain.

There are 5 families of lemur with more than 50 species and hundreds of subspecies. Lemurs originated in Africa, but they were outcompeted by large monkeys and apes. They had left Africa 62 to 65 million years ago and arrived to Madagascar on large rafts made of vegetation. With only few natural enemies, lemurs managed to quickly occupy the entire island and evolve into numerous species. Unfortunately, 90% of all known lemur species will probably become extinct in the next 20 to 25 years due to accelerated habitat loss and illegal hunting.  Interesting Lemur Facts:  Lemur can reach 3.6 to 27 inches in length and 1.1 ounce to 20 pounds of weight. Dwarf mouse lemur is the smallest species of lemur, while Indri lemur is the largest.  Lemur has thin fur that can be black, grey, brown or reddish colored.  Lemur has pointed nose, huge eyes and long bushy tail that is much longer than the rest of the body (it can reach 22 to 25 inches in length in the large species). Lemur has human-like hands with opposable thumbs and flat fingernails. Second toe on the hind feet is equipped with claw that is used for grooming.  Lemur is very intelligent animal. It can learn to use tool and perform simple arithmetic tasks.  Name "lemur" means "spirits of the night" in Latin, and it refers to the nocturnal nature of these animals. Despite the name, some lemurs are also active during the day.  Lemur is adapted to the life in the trees, but some species, such as ring-tailed lemur, spend plenty of time on the ground. Lemur can stand on two legs, but it always walks on four legs.  Lemur eats fruit, leaves, flowers, tree sap and bark. Plant-based diet is occasionally supplemented with small vertebrates and insects.  Lemur plays important role in dispersal of seed in the wild.  Lemur can slow down its metabolism and hibernate when food is scarce (the only primate that hibernates).  Most species of lemur live in family groups of around 15 animals. Groups can be composed of animals of both or only one gender. Dominant female is the leader of the group. Some species, such as aye-aye, are solitary.  Lemurs communicate via scent from the glands on the feet and buttocks, via loud screeching noise and by using their long tails.  The only natural enemies of lemurs (besides humans) are fossa and the harrier hawk.  Lemurs mate only when there is plenty of food. Pregnancy lasts 9 to 24 weeks (depending on the species), and ends with 2 babies in most cases. Different species of lemur can interbreed in the captivity and create new hybrid species.  Lemurs reach sexual maturity at the age of 2 years.  Lemur can survive around 18 years in the wild and up to 30 years in the captivity.

Largely undertreated is the racially motivated theory undergirding Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki project — that the first settlers in Polynesia were a race of bearded, white-skinned supermen who remained deities in both South American and Polynesian mythology. Contemporary commemorations, however, emphasize feel-good stories of human achievement over Heyerdahl’s racist performance.  Click for larger view  View full resolution  Figure 1.  Thor Heyerdahl aboard Kon-Tiki, several weeks into his voyage across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia. (Courtesy of the Kon-Tiki Museum)  Like many others, I spent most of my life only vaguely understanding the significance of Thor Heyerdahl. In 1947 the Norwegian adventurer built a log raft using ancient South American practices and sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia in a riveting adventure that captured the world’s attention. He published his book on the crossing in 1948; the first English-language edition was published in 1950. I grew up with a paperback copy of Heyerdahl’s best-selling account of the voyage, Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft, on my family’s bookshelf, but I had never read it. However, from the beginning of my formal research on historical simulations, I repeatedly encountered the story of Heyerdahl as a game-changer when it came to using performance to generate understanding about the past. Heyerdahl’s performative experiment, sailing a balsa raft christened with the name of the Peruvian sun god from South America to Polynesia, proved possible his theory of east-to-west colonization of the islands. The foundational text on living history, Jay Anderson’s Time Machines (1984) , positions Heyerdahl as a [End Page 25] pioneer who legitimized the use of hands-on practices to figure out those of the past: “It was the 1947 Kon-Tiki expedition [...] that established [Heyerdahl] as the best-known of the experimental archaeologists,” writes Anderson, “After the Kon-Tiki voyage, simulation became a more acceptable research tool ( Anderson 1984 :89). Anderson’s follow up to Time Machines, the Living History Reader, puts Heyerdahl in a category of influence with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who financed Colonial Williamsburg, and James Deetz, who, in one of his first acts as director of Plimoth Plantation, jettisoned the fairy-tale buckled-hatted Pilgrims from the 1620s village the day before opening the 1969 season, initiating a new era of social history and kitchen-sink realism in living museums ( Anderson 1991 :3).  Theatre and performance scholars are no strangers to the performative innovations Heyerdahl ushered into the mid-20th century, either. The physical “recreation” of a primitive seagoing balsa raft fits within the same kind of mid-century experimental archaeology techniques used by Richard Southern in reconstructing morality play stages for his Medieval Theatre in the Round (1957) and those Peter Arnott used to deduce ancient Athenian staging techniques in Greek Scenic Conventions in Fifth Century B.C.

Although Delaware is the second smallest state in the United States, its population was approximately                            112,216 at the beginning of the war. Its size makes it a useful microcosm in understanding the divisiveness of the war.\xa0  \xa0  Factionalism, from abolitionism to secessionism, existed in Delaware, but                            many of its citizens did not align with either extreme. For example, there are three counties in Delaware. New Castle, which                            contains the city of Wilmington, was a center of trade, industry, and Republicanism. The two other counties, Kent and Sussex,                            were agricultural and generally pro-Southern. \xa0Thousands of men enlisted in the Union, but several hundred joined the                            Confederacy. Communities were divided, and Union troops had to patrol election polls to protect Republican voters.  \xa0  After the colonial period,the agricultural economy of the state began                            to shift from tobacco to mixed farming, which created less need for slave labor. In 1860, there were 1,789 slaves in the state                            and 19,829 free African Americans. Many slaves ran away during the war, and some elected to serve the Union. In 1863, 954                            African Americans joined the Union army, and handful of others served in the navy. However, many citizens of this state were                            not happy with the Emancipation Proclamation. In the 1864 election, they voted for George B. McClellan, the Democratic candidate. After the war, Delaware Democrats rejected the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments and                            worked to disenfranchise African Americans for several decades.  \xa0  Although Delaware was not a battlefield, the war did find its way                            into the First State. Fort Delaware became a prison for Confederate prisoners of war. The fortress was completed shortly before                            the war began and is located on Pea Patch Island. The fort earned a reputation for cruelty and the moniker “Andersonville                            of the North.” However, the death rate in Fort Delaware, which supported a prison population of over 30,000, was only                            7.6%. Most northern prisoners had a rate of twenty-one percent. See also: Sectionalism \xa0and\xa0 Causes of the American Civil War .

One of Kentucky’s                            more prominent nineteenth century Senators, Henry Clay, spent much of his career trying to compromise the issue of slavery                            before the war. His most well known efforts were in crafting the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the later Compromise of 1850.  \xa0  As clear from these most prominent residents, Kentucky was a state of divided loyalties and families torn apart. The state provided 90,000 troops                            to the Union and 35,000 to the Confederacy. Nowhere was this division more evident than in the "First Family." Several members                            of Mary Todd Lincoln\'s family fought for the South. Another family similarly divided was that of U.S. Senator John Crittenden,                            whose two sons were generals on opposite sides. Some historians even say that the ensuing family feuds, such as the Hatfields                            and the McCoys, carried on the war in Kentucky long after its official end.

Although only made from earth and wood, it resisted several Welsh attacks and sieges over the next 30 years, the castle establishing itself at the heart of the Norman-controlled lands of southwest Wales.  In the 12th century Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, eldest son of Roger de Montgomerie, was forced to forfeit his British lands and titles after he rebelled against King Henry I. By 1138 King Stephen had given Pembroke Castle to Gilbert de Clare who used it as a base in the Norman invasion of Ireland.  In August 1189 Richard I arranged the marriage of Isabel, Gilbert de Clare\'s granddaughter, to William Marshal who later received both the castle and the title, Earl of Pembroke. He set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive stone castle with a massive round stone keep - only royal towers of the period are comparable in scale. Marshall was succeeded by each of his five sons. His third son, Gilbert Marshal, was responsible for enlarging and further strengthening the castle between 1234 and 1241.  All of Marshal\'s sons died childless. In 1247, the castle was inherited by William de Valence, a half-brother of Henry III who became Earl of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan, William Marshal\'s granddaughter. The Valence family held Pembroke for 70 years. During this time, the town was fortified with defensive walls, three main gates and a postern.  Pembroke Castle became de Valence\'s military base for fighting the Welsh princes, during the conquest of North Wales by Edward I between 1277 and 1295.  On the death of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (son of William de Valence) the castle passed through marriage to the Hastings family. In 1389, 17-year-old John Hastings died in a jousting accident ending a line of inheritance stretching back 250 years.  The castle reverted to Richard II. Short tenancies were then granted by the Crown. By 1400 Owain Glyndwr had begun a rebellion in Wales, but Pembroke escaped attack because the castle\'s Constable, Francis а Court, paid off Glyndwr.  Eventually the castle and the earldom were presented to Jasper Tudor by his half-brother Henry VI in 1452. Tudor brought his widowed sister-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, to Pembroke where she gave birth to her only child, the future King Henry VII of England who was born in 1457.  In the 15th and 16th centuries the castle saw a period of peace. At the outbreak of the English Civil War most of South Wales sided with the King but Pembroke declared for Parliament. It was besieged by Royalist troops and saved after Parliamentary reinforcements arrived by sea from nearby Milford Haven.

She was the first woman in New Zealand to hold the office of prime minister immediately following an election.  Helen Clark, 2005.  Sean Gallup/Getty Images  Clark, the oldest of four children of George and Margaret Clark, grew up on a sheep and cattle farm in Te Pahu, west of Hamilton. She left home at age 12 to attend Epsom Girls Grammar School in Auckland . After graduation, she enrolled in the University of Auckland, where she received bachelor’s (1971) and master’s (1974) degrees in political science and taught from 1973 to 1981.  Clark joined the Labour Party in 1971 and during the following decade held a variety of positions within the party. In parliamentary elections in 1975, she was selected as the Labour candidate for a seat that was considered safe for the conservative National Party . Although she lost that election, she was elected to Parliament from a different constituency in 1981. As chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Select Committee (1984–87), she played a major role in the country’s adoption of an antinuclear policy, which effectively ended the ANZUS Pact and led to reduced military ties between New Zealand and the United States . In 1987 Clark became a member of the cabinet, holding at various times the portfolios of housing, conservation , labour , and health . In 1989–90 she served as deputy prime minister, and in 1990 she was appointed to the Privy Council , becoming the first woman in New Zealand to hold those offices.  After the National Party’s return to power in 1990, Clark became deputy leader of the opposition in Parliament. In 1993 she was elected head of the Labour Party —becoming the first woman in New Zealand to head a major party—and thus served as leader of the opposition. In 1999, when the Labour Party was able to form a governing coalition, Clark was elected prime minister. Holding the portfolio of arts and culture herself, she appointed an extraordinarily diverse cabinet, including 11 women and 4 Maori . As prime minister, Clark addressed many controversial issues, including Maori rights, same-sex civil unions, and prostitution, which was legalized in 2003. Her government also opposed the U.S. and British invasion of Iraq (see Iraq War ). She was reelected prime minister in both 2002 and 2005, the first New Zealand prime minister to secure three consecutive terms in office. Amid an economic downturn, Clark’s Labour Party was defeated by John Key and the National Party in the 2008 election. Clark subsequently stepped down as Labour leader. In 2009 Clark was named the administrator of the United Nations Development Programme .

This includes the only remaining Cheddar Cheese company making the cheese actually in Cheddar - The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company. The local Tourist Information Office is in Cheddar Gorge itself just down from Cheddar Caves.  Cheddar Cheese  According to local legend Cheddar Cheese was discovered accidentally when a milkmaid left a pail of milk in the nearby Cheddar Gorge caves. Later the milkmaid returned to find that the milk had turned into a new tasty substance and Cheddar cheese was born. Whether this is true or not we will never know, as Cheddar Cheese was only first recorded in 1170. The distinctive tangy taste is said to be due to the traditionally rich pastures grazed by the cows whose milk is used to produce the cheese. It was traditionally matured in the Cheddar caves and The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company has recently revived this tradition.  You will see and smell the aroma of their rounds of cheese wrapped in muslin cheesecloth if you visit Gough's Cave.  The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company is the only cheese-makers still producing Cheddar Cheese in Cheddar. You can visit the Shop and Dairy in Cheddar Gorge and take a guided tour to find out how Cheddar Cheese is made.

Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries—even death.  Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is unexpectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite  Heathcliff’s clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine’s ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.  When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.  Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley’s cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father’s death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.  When he returns, he has mysteriously acquired wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to a baby girl, Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.  Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine’s post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.  Analysis  Despite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly’s narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!  Nelly’s judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.  It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.  All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.

Although the plays of William Shakespeare may be the most widely read works in the English language, little is known for certain about the playwright himself. Some scholars even believe the plays were not written by William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon but by some other well-educated, aristocratic writer who wished to remain anonymous.  Shakespeare’s father was probably a common tradesman. He became an alderman and bailiff in Stratford-upon-Avon, and Shakespeare was baptized in the town on April 26, 1564. At age 18, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, and the couple had a daughter in 1583 and twins in 1585. Sometime later, Shakespeare set off for London to become an actor and by 1592 was well established in London’s theatrical world as both a performer and a playwright. His earliest plays, including The Comedy of Errors and The Taming of the Shrew, were written in the early 1590s. Later in the decade, he wrote tragedies such as Romeo and Juliet (1594-1595) and comedies including The Merchant of Venice (1596-1597). His greatest tragedies were written after 1600, including Hamlet (1600-01), Othello (1604-05), King Lear (1605-06), and Macbeth (1605-1606).  He became a member of the popular theater group the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, who later became the King’s Men. The group built and operated the famous Globe Theater in 1599. Shakespeare ultimately became a major shareholder in the troupe and earned enough money to buy a large house in Stratford in 1597. He retired to Stratford in 1610, where he wrote his last plays, including The Tempest (1611) and The Winter’s Tale (1610-11). Meanwhile, he had written more than 100 sonnets, which were published in 1609. Although pirated versions of Titus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet and some other plays were published during Shakespeare’s lifetime, no definitive collection of his works was published until after his death. In 1623, two members of Shakespeare’s troupe collected the plays and printed what is now called the First Folio (1623).

09/30/2021 16:23:08 - INFO - __main__ - retrieved_examples (mir)=[('Context: TurbineA turbine (from the Latin turbo, a vortex, related to the Greek , tyrbē, meaning "turbulence"),   is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  Gas, steam, and water turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854–1931), for invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845–1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.  The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude Burdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  Benoit Fourneyron, a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.   Operation theory   A working fluid contains potential energy (pressure head) and kinetic energy (velocity head). The fluid may be compressible or incompressible. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:  Impulse turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid\'s pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle.  Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton\'s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Reaction turbines develop torque by reacting to the gas or fluid\'s pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton\'s third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.  In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in | Question: What main category of machines \'produce continuous power from a wheel/rotor, usually with vanes, revolved by fast flowing fluid\'?', ['turbine engines', 'reaction turbine', 'turbines', 'turbine', 'turbine blades', 'impulse turbine'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2376'), ('Context: The Queen Is DeadThe Queen Is Dead is the third studio album by the English rock band the Smiths. It was released on 16 June 1986 in the United Kingdom by Rough Trade Records and released in the United States on 23 June 1986 through Sire Records.  The album spent twenty two weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two. Across the Atlantic, it reached number 28 in Canada on the RPM 100 album chart  and number 70 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990. It has sold consistently well ever since and has received unanimous critical acclaim, with NME listing it as the greatest album of all time in 2013.   Songwriting  Guitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while the Smiths toured Britain in early 1985, working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks.  The title of the album is from the novel, "Last Exit to Brooklyn" by author Hubert Selby, Jr..  The title of the album could be a reference to the scene in Macbeth where Seyton informs the title character of his wife\'s murder ("The queen, my Lord, is dead").  The title could also refer to a scene in Cymbeline where Cornelius, the doctor, informs Cymbeline, the king, "The queen is dead."  "The Boy with the Thorn in His Side" was, according to Marr, "an effortless piece of music", and was written on tour in the spring of 1985. The song\'s lyrics refer allegorically to the band\'s experience of the music industry that failed to appreciate it. In 2003, Morrissey named this as his favourite Smiths song.   A demo of the music for "Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others" was posted by Marr through Morrissey\'s letterbox in the summer of 1985. Morrissey then completed the song by adding lyrics. Marr has stated that he "preferred the music to the lyrics".  "Frankly, Mr. Shankly", "I Know It\'s Over" and "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" were written by Morrissey and Marr in a "marathon" writing session in the late summer of 1985 at Marr\'s home in Bowdon, Greater Manchester. The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis, head of the Smiths\' record label Rough Trade. Travis has since described it as "a funny lyric" about "Morrissey\'s desire to be somewhere else", acknowledging that a line in the song about "bloody awful poetry" was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey.   "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" features lyrics drawn from "Lonely Planet Boy" by the New York Dolls. According to Marr: "When we first played it, I thought it was the best song I\'d ever heard". The guitar part of "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\' draws on the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye\'s "Hitch Hike", a song that, itself, was an inspiration for the Velvet Underground\'s "There She Goes Again".   The music for "Never Had No One Ever", completed in August 1985, was based on a demo which Marr had recorded in December 1984, itself based on "I Need Somebody" by the Stooges. According to Marr: "The atmosphere of that track pretty much sums up the whole album and what it was like recording it." The lyric to the song reflects Morrissey\'s feeling unsafe and, being from an immigrant family, not at home on the streets of Manchester.   "The Boy with the Thorn in His Side", "Bigmouth Strikes Again" and "Frankly, Mr. Shankly" were debuted live during a tour of Scotland in September and October, during which "The Queen Is Dead" and "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" were soundchecked. "The Queen is Dead" was based on a song Marr began writing as a teenager.

Up Next Governments suck at social media, but you deserve some blame  Nintendo  The Wii U\'s troubles attracting gamers won\'t be solved by a price cut, Nintendo chief Satoru Iwata argues.  Speaking to reporters in Tokyo yesterday , Iwata acknowledged that Wii U sales disappointed last year, but he didn\'t necessarily feel that dropping the price of the $299 basic set or the $349 deluxe set would do the company much good.  "We are already offering it at a good price," Iwata said, according to the Associated Press.  Nintendo yesterday announced its earnings for the nine-month period that ended December 31 . Although it was able to turn a slight profit, the company\'s revenue was down 2.4 percent from a year earlier. The Wii U, which was expected to significantly boost Nintendo revenue during the period, was only able to muster 3 million unit sales. The earnings release didn\'t directly discuss Wii U demand, but Nintendo indicated that the release of classic games for the console, like Mario Kart and Legend of Zelda, should "help Nintendo regain momentum for Wii U."  In his discussion with reporters, Iwata said that the Wii U needs more and better games to drive console sales, and so far, that issue "has not been solved."  "I feel a deep sense of responsibility for not being able to produce results for our year-end business," Iwata said.  The Wii U\'s performance was more than a little disconcerting. Although Wii sales during the same point in its lifecycle were only 3.2 million units, they would have been much higher if not for Nintendo\'s inability to meet its massive demand. For a long time after the Wii\'s launch, the device was hard to find on store shelves, and consumers would line up each week in the hopes of scoring one of the few units available at their local retailer.  The Wii U\'s situation is much different. Nintendo\'s console is easy to find on store shelves. The trouble is, demand for the console -- especially in the U.S. -- is weak.  Nintendo dealt with a similar issue when it launched its 3DS in 2011. However, the company was able to boost demand and increase sales with a price cut. It appears that, for now, Nintendo won\'t follow that plan with the Wii U.  Still, Nintendo\'s console isn\'t cheap, compared to other hardware it has launched. The Wii, for example, launched for $249 -- $50 less than the cheaper Wii U option. Another popular Nintendo launch, the Nintendo 64, was made available for $199.  Iwata\'s argument was bolstered by famed developer and Mario creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. Speaking to reporters, Miyamoto said that Wii U demand will get a jump-start once people try it out and "see it is fun."  Wii U (Platform) - Giant BombWii U (Platform) - Giant Bomb  US: $12.99  Software  The Wii U supports retail and downloadable software. Nintendo stated that from day-one, all first party retail software will also be available day-and-date in the Wii U\'s eShop. The exception being games that come bundled with hardware such as SiNG Party which comes with a microphone. Those would not be available as a download. In addition to retail software, the Wii U eShop will also offer download-only software like Virtual Console titles and original games.  The regular price of retail Wii U titles is raised to $59.99, bringing Nintendo\'s software prices up to the same level of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 titles.

Damon Albarn and bassist Alex James at Glastonbury in 1998\xa0Photo: Jeff Gilbert  By Urmee Khan  6:59AM GMT 10 Dec 2008  The Britpop group announced they will play a concert in London\'s Hyde Park next summer.  The full line-up of Graham Coxon, Alex James, Dave Rowntree and Damon Albarn will be onstage together for this first time since their Royal Festival Hall performance in 2000.  In an interview with the NME, Coxon and Albarn talk about how they made up.  Albarn said: "Ten years ago Graham and I found ourselves very uncomfortable, very over-sensitive with each other, and it hasn\'t felt comfortable before now."  Coxon left Blur six years ago and the band\'s last album, Think Tank, was released in 2003.  Related Articles  NME Awards: Blur\'s Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon reunite on stage  26 Feb 2009  Coxon said that 10 years ago "we were both carrying some troubles, but it was our group and we didn\'t want to hurt each other\'s feelings by saying \'Look I need a break\'."  He added: "It\'s not that Blur ever stopped, no, we just did other things..."  There have also been reports of further dates, including a possible appearance at next year\'s Glastonbury festival.  Albarn promised fans that there were more shows on the horizon.  The band formed in Colchester in 1989, the they have recorded seven studio albums and had a string of top 10 singles including two number ones with Country House and Beetlebum.  Blur hit the height of their fame as the poster boys for Brit Pop in the mid 1990s, and were known for their chart battles with contemporaries Oasis.  Albarn has since gone on to form virtual band Gorillaz, to huge commercial and critical success.  His projects have included supergroup The Good, The Bad & The Queen and the much-lauded Monkey: Journey To The West.  Guitarist Coxon released solo work since quitting the band and has collaborated with Pete Doherty.  Bassist Alex James swapped his bad boy image to become a Cotswolds cheese maker and drummer Dave Rowntree made an unsuccessful bid to become a Labour councillor last year.  The Hyde Park concert will take place on Friday July 3, and tickets will be on general sale from 9am this Friday at http://www.livenation.co.uk  All tickets are £45, are limited to six per person, and are subject to a booking fee, according to the band\'s website.  \xa0  BBC - Music - 7 Ages of Rock - BlurBBC - Music - 7 Ages of Rock - Blur  7 Ages of Rock  (L-R): Dave Rowntree, Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James  Blur  Dave Rowntree  Biography  Blur are an English rock band formed in Colchester in 1989. Originally named Seymour, Blur became one of the biggest bands in the UK during the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s.[1] The band are currently comprised of vocalist/keyboardist Damon Albarn, drummer Dave Rowntree and bassist Alex James.  Blur\'s original influences on their debut album, Leisure, included contemporary British alternative rock trends such as Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change in the mid-1990s, influenced by 1960s English pop groups such as The Kinks and The Beatles, the band released Modern Life is Rubbish, Parklife and The Great Escape. As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a famous chart battle with Britpop rivals Oasis...

Blurb  As soon as Anne Shirley arrives at the snug white farmhouse called Green Gables , she is sure she wants to stay forever... but will Marilla and Matthew send her back to the orphanage? Anne knows she\'s not what they expected - a skinny girl with fiery red hair and a temper to match. If only she can convince them to let her stay, she\'ll try very hard not to keep rushed headlong into scrapes and blurting out the first thing that comes to her mind. Anne is not like anybody else, the Cuthberts agree; she is special - a girl with an enormous imagination. This orphan girl dreams of the day when she can call herself Anne of Green Gables. (from the 1998 Bantam Books reissue)  Plot  Read: Anne of Green Gables (Chapter 1: Mrs. Rachel Lynde is Surprised)  " Mrs. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies\' eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde\'s Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde\'s door without due regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof."  —The first sentence, which contains 148 words [src]  It is early June, and Mrs. Rachel Lynde is sitting at her window knitting when she spies Matthew Cuthbert , "the shyest man alive", driving out of Avonlea while wearing his best suit and a white collar. Puzzled as to the reason why, Mrs. Lynde goes over to visit Matthew\'s sister, Marilla , at Green Gables .  Marilla tells Mrs. Lynde that she and Matthew have decided to adopt a boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia to help Matthew on the farm, as he is sixty and has been having heart problems. They contacted Mrs. Spencer, who is getting a little girl, and asked her to pick out a boy for them too. Matthew has gone to pick up the boy from the Bright River train station. Mrs. Lynde disapproves thoroughly and tells Marilla story after story of this orphan or that orphan who poisoned the well or set the house on fire.  Chapter 2: Matthew Cuthbert is Surprised  Read: Anne of Green Gables (Chapter 2: Matthew Cuthbert is Surprised)  Matthew, meanwhile, is driving the sorrel mare eight miles to the Bright River train station on the way to pick up the expected boy. The station is empty, so he asks the stationmaster about the five-thirty train. The stationmaster, who is about to leave to go home, tells him that the train he\'s expecting came and left half an hour before.  "But there was a passenger dropped off for you--a little girl. She\'s sitting out there on the shingles.

It was triggered by Nicholas II and his wish to expand the Russian empire in Asia. The tsar entered the war overconfidence and haughty. He considered Japan an easy foe: a feudal nation of barefooted samurai and daimyo\xa0still emerging from medieval feudalism. But this proved a gross underestimation of the Japanese and their industrial and military development, which had outstripped Russia’s own. Within 18 months, Russian forces had been besieged and defeated, her ageing navy humiliated and the prestige of the tsar and his empire humiliated on the world stage. Even more telling was the economic impact the war had on the Russian economy, which fanned the flames of revolution in 1905.  Nicholas II, who equated imperial expansion with successful leadership, had a strong interest in acquiring new territory and expanding the Russian empire. Of particular interest to the tsar was consolidating and increasing Russia’s influence in Asia. Russia had controlled Manchuria, a large area of north-west China, since 1860. In 1898 St Petersburg also gained control of Port Arthur, a coastal town in north-east China. Port Arthur became strategically important to the Russian navy because it provided a safe warm-water harbour for its Pacific fleet (Russian port cities like Vladivostok, further north, were prone to ice floes). The Russians began constructing a branch from the Trans-Siberian railway through Manchuria to Port Arthur. This improvement in infrastructure allowed the Russians in increase their military and economic presence in Port Arthur specifically and northern China generally.  This growing Russian presence posed problems for Japan, which also had strong imperial ambitions in Korea and northern China. The Japanese had controlled the Korean peninsula since the mid-1890s – but as Russian traders moved into Manchuria in numbers they began to encroach on Japanese interests in and around Korea. The Japanese government, supported by its British allies, attempted to short-circuit a territorial dispute and possible war by initiating negotiations with St Petersburg. In essence, Japan promised to recognise Russian autonomy in Manchuria, provided the Russians recognised Japanese control of Korea. But Russian diplomats, confident that Japan would not go to war, attempted to stall the negotiations, before insisting that Japan minimise its military presence in Korea. The negotiations eventually collapsed and in early 1904 the two countries severed diplomatic ties. Bolstered by support from the British, Japan declared war on Russia in February 8th 1904 – three hours after Japanese forces began an assault on Port Arthur.  “At the outset, the government presented the war as a religious struggle, with Serafim as its patron saint. Officers setting out for the front made pilgrimages to Sarov, and parents of soldiers traveled to Sarov to beg the protection of Serafim. Priests blessed the troops with his icon. The grand duchess Elizabeth Fedorovna carried the relics of Serafim with her when she attended to the war casualties in Moscow’s military hospitals.”  Boris Pasternak  Despite the surprise attack, the tsar and most of his advisors felt confident of victory. Japan had only opened its borders to imperial powers in the mid-1800s; while it had made considerable advances in industrialisation and Western military techniques, few believed it could defeat a major European power like\xa0Russia. Propaganda of the day ridiculed the Japanese military for its lack of size and lack of firepower, criticism that was partly justified. But Japan also had several advantages. Its small navy was equipped with several British-supplied warships of recent construction, in comparison to Russia’s larger but more antiquated fleet. Japanese culture was militaristic; its\xa0generals and admirals were trained in both ancient and modern Western strategy and tactics; they were promoted on merit and achievement rather than social status. Unlike the Russians, the Japanese respected the enemy and were acutely aware of his strengths and weaknesses.  By August 1904 the Japanese had encircled and laid siege to Port Arthur. More than 100,000 Japanese soldiers surrounded the port city, digging kilometres of trenches and attacking the city’s fortifications with gunfire | Question: The navy from which country destroyed the Russian fleet at Port Arthur after a number of attacks in 1904 and 1905?', ['japan'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-2812'), ('Context: Pete Ploszek as Leonardo : The leader of the turtles who wields a pair of katana in battle   Alan Ritchson as Raphael : The hot - headed brother who wields a pair of sai in battle .

Eye  The eye is the organ of sight (vision) in humans and animals. The eye works by transforming light waves into visual images. Eighty percent of all information received by the human brain comes from the eyes. These organs are almost spherical in shape and are housed in the eye (orbital) sockets in the skull.  Sight begins when light waves enter the eye through the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of the eye), pass through the pupil (the  Words to Know  Aqueous humor: Clear liquid filling the small cavities between the cornea and the iris and between the iris and the lens.  Astigmatism: Vision disorder caused by an uneven curvature in the cornea (sometimes the lens), resulting in indistinct or slightly out-of-focus images.  Cataract: A clouding of the lens of the eye.  Choroid: Delicate membrane between the sclera and the retina.  Cones: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in bright light and are sensitive to color.  Cornea: Protective lens covering the iris.  Farsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too short or a lens that is too weak; objects far away are seen easily while those up close appear blurry.  Glaucoma: Serious vision disorder caused by a buildup of aqueous humor, resulting in pressure against the retina.  Iris: Colored portion around the pupil that regulates the amount of light entering the eye.  Lacrimal gland: Tear-producing gland that lies immediately above each eyeball at the outer corner of the eye socket.  Nearsightedness: Vision disorder caused by an eyeball that is too long or a lens that is too strong; objects up close are seen easily while those far away appear blurry.  Pupil: Adjustable opening in the center of the iris through which light enters the eye.  Retina: Photosensitive lining inside the eye.  Rods: Light-sensitive nerve cells of the retina that function chiefly in dim light.  Sclera: Tough, fibrous outer covering (the "white") of the eyeball.  Vitreous humor: Clear, gel-like substance inside the large cavity in back of the lens (the center of the eyeball).  opening in the center of the colored portion of the eye, called the iris), then through a clear lens behind the iris. The lens focuses light onto the retina, which functions like the film in a camera. Nerve cells in retinas, called rods and cones, convert light energy into electrical impulses. These impulses are then carried via the optic nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as images.  The human eyeball is about 0.9 inch (2.3 centimeters) in diameter and is not perfectly round, being slightly flattened in the front and back. The eye consists of three layers: the sclera (pronounced SKLIR-a), the choroid (pronounced KOR-oid), and the retina.  Sclera  The sclera, the outer fibrous layer, encases and protects the eyeball. The visible portion of the sclera is seen as the "white" of the eye. When that portion is irritated, the small blood vessels contained in the layer enlarge, producing a "bloodshot eye." In the center of the visible portion of the sclera is the cornea, which projects slightly forward. A delicate membrane, the conjunctiva, covers the cornea and visible portion of the sclera.  Choroid  The choroid is a thin membrane lying underneath the sclera. It is composed of a dense pigment and numerous blood vessels that nourish the internal tissues of the eye. At the front end of the choroid is the ciliary body. Running like a ring around the visible portion of the eye, the ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris. The ciliary body contains muscles that are connected by ligaments to the lens behind the iris. The iris is the visible portion of the choroid.

He had a career resurgence after playing for laughs in the three "Austin Powers" movies (1997—2002).

Born: June 2, 1947 - Hexham, Northumberland, England  The English conductor, Mark Philip Elder, is the son of a dentist. As a youth he divulged talent both as a singer and instrumentalist, serving as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and as the first-chair bassoonist in the National Youth Orchestra. He studied music at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied music and was a choral scholar. He was later mentored by renowned British conductor and musicologist Edward Downes. Elder worked briefly in minor capacities at Glyndeboune and Covent Garden before gaining experience conducting Verdi operas as a regular conductor at the Sydney Opera House, Australia from 1972 to 1974. He returned to England in 1974. | Question: Born in Hexham in 1947, what is the profession of Mark Elder?", ['conducting'], 'mrqa_triviaqa-validation-5936'), ('Context: JapanJapan ( Nippon or Nihon; formally  \' or Nihon-koku, "State of Japan") is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, China, Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The kanji that make up Japan\'s name mean "sun origin", and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun".  Japan is a stratovolcanic archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku, which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan\'s land area. The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions. The population of 126\xa0million is the world\'s tenth largest. Japanese people make up 98.5% of Japan\'s total population. Approximately 9.1 million people live in the core city of Tokyo,  the capital city of Japan, which is the sixth largest city proper in the OECD and the fourth leading global city in the world.  The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the world\'s largest metropolitan area with over 35 million residents and the world\'s largest urban agglomeration economy.  Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan\'s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.  Japan is a member of the UN, the G7, the G8, and the G20 and is considered a great power.    The country has the world\'s third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world\'s fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the world\'s fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a modern military with the world\'s eighth largest military budget,  used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a high standard of living and Human Development Index whose population enjoys the highest life expectancy, the third lowest infant mortality in the world,    and ranked first in the number of Nobel laureates of any country in Asia.  Japan is ranked first in the Country Brand Index,[http://www.futurebrand.com/news/futurebrand-launches-the-country-brand-index-2014-15 FutureBrand | News | FutureBrand launches the Country Brand Index 2014–15] ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report 2015–2016   and is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.  Japan was the first country in Asia to host both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games.  Etymology  The English word Japan possibly derives from the early Mandarin Chinese or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese name, , which in Japanese is pronounced Nippon  or Nihon .

Conventionally the term has been most widely applied to simple teaching of the skills of dealing with numbers for practical purposes, e.g., computation of areas, proportions, costs, and the like. The four fundamental operations of this study are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In advanced study the concept of number is greatly generalized to include not only complex numbers, but also quaternions, tensors, and abstract entities with no other meaning than that they obey certain laws (see algebra ). The division of arithmetic into the practical and the theoretical dates back to classical Greek times, when the term logistic referred to elementary arithmetic and the term arithmetic was reserved for the theory.

See more Encyclopedia articles on: Mathematics  Arithmetic - WonderWhizKidsArithmetic  Arithmetic  Arithmetic  Arithmetic  Arithmetic Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that concerns counting and working with numbers and fractions based on below four operations: addition (+), subtraction (–), multiplication (×) and division (÷).  Checking accounts online One critical use of daily arithmetic is checking accounts online.  With the threat of identity theft and online banking, it is critical to be able to possess an overall sense of basic arithmetic in such settings.  The word "Arithmetic" is from Greek "arithmos", meaning "number".  Arithmetic is the most basic form of mathematics. It concerns counting  and working with numbers and fractions based on the four operations:  addition, subtraction, multiplication and division although the more  advanced operations, such as manipulations of percentages, square root,  exponentiation and logarithmic functions, are also a part of this  subject. In one way or another, every equation, graph, and an enormous amount of other things can be broken down into these four basic operations. As people say, math is a language, and addition subtraction, multiplication, and division are its alphabet, along with the number line as well. Arithmetic is performed according to an order of operations.  Historically, the researchers have found that the initial significance  of arithmetic had been realized during the third century B.C.  The term "arithmetic" is also used to refer to elementary number  theory.            This includes the properties of integers related to primality, divisibility, and the solution of equations in integers, as well as modern research that is an outgrowth of this study. It\'s in this context that one runs across the fundamental  theorem of arithmetic and arithmetical functions. From a general perspective, arithmetic allows individuals to think, reflect, and reason out. Plato, who is one of the greatest philosophers of all time, believed that any person who has good arithmetic skills will also do very well in other knowledge-based competencies.  Arithmetic  is used by almost everyone, for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day  counting to advanced science and business calculations. It is difficult to think of a situation where an average person does not make regular use of arithmetic in daily life. For example, we use arithmetic for so many routine activities like: finding out time by looking at our watches, figuring out how many more days of school before we get off for Saturday and Sunday and so on.  The modern science and its achievements has a great contribution from arithmetic. We cannot analyze light, electricity or a tiniest atom which uses mathematics which has its paternity in arithmetic only. Mathematics has its sound base in arithmetic and can be used as tool to critically examine and asses both physical and abstract things. Any thing can be quantified for its quality and special characteristics and then it can be compared, assessed or examined.

It is  the third most abundant element in the crust and the most plentiful metallic  element, but is never found on its own in nature. Bauxite is the ore most  commonly mined for aluminium in which aluminium occurs as hydroxide minerals.  Aluminium is a silvery-white, tough and lightweight metal (specific gravity  2.7). It is a good conductor of heat and electricity, is very resistant to atmospheric  corrosion (it never rusts), is nontoxic, inflammable, nonmagnetic and  non-sparking, and it is malleable and ductile. Because of these properties it  has become an important metal.  Metallic aluminium was first isolated in 1825 by Hans Christian Oersted  from aluminium chloride but it was not commercially produced until 1888 with  the establishment of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company (known as Alcoa since  1907). Aluminium can be mixed with almost any other metal and these alloys typically  combine lightness with strength. As a result, they are used in a great variety  of industries. In Australia, aluminium is produced in Tasmania, Queensland,  Victoria and New South Wales with the building and construction industries being  the most important consumers.  Occurrence  In 1821, French geologist Pierre Berthier discovered an  aluminium-rich material near the village of Les Baux in Provence, France. It  was named bauxite after the village. Bauxite occurs as a weathered cover or  blanket, known as laterite or duricrust, over a variety of alumina-bearing rocks.  It forms when large amounts of rainfall leach away the more mobile elements in  the host rock leaving the relatively immobile aluminium with some silicon, iron  and titanium. Because of the way it forms, bauxite deposits can be very  extensive and are found on almost every continent. The largest known economic  resources occur in Guinea and Australia, followed by Brazil, Vietnam and Jamaica.  The main aluminium minerals in bauxite are gibbsite [Al(OH)3, also written as Al2O3.H2O  in oxide notation], boehmite [AlO(OH), written as Al2O3.H2O  in oxide notation] and diaspore, which is a polymorph of boehmite but is denser  and harder. Pure alumina (Al2O3) contains 52.9% aluminium  and 47.1% oxygen. Bauxite may be as hard as rock or as soft as mud and may  occur as compacted earth (both friable and re-cemented), small balls  (pisolites), or hollow, twig-like material (tubules). Its colours may be buff,  pink, yellow, red, or white, or any combination of these.  Bauxite ore refers to bauxite that contains sufficiently high  levels of Al2O3 and suitably low levels of iron oxide (Fe2O3)  and silica (SiO2) to be economically mineable. The amount of  reactive silica is particularly important as this form of silica consumes the  caustic soda needed to make alumina, thus low reactive silica is desirable. Other  potential sources of aluminium include a variety of rocks and minerals such as  aluminous shale and slate, aluminium phosphate rock and high-alumina clays.  Australian Resources and Deposits  In 2014, Australia was the world’s largest producer of bauxite  (30%) and the second largest producer of alumina (19%). Bauxite is mined from established  open cut operations at Weipa in Queensland, Gove in the Northern Territory and  the Darling Range in Western Australia. Additionally, new mines have begun  operation in the Cape York region of Queensland and in central Tasmania. Other  bauxite deposits occur in northern Western Australia, New South Wales and  eastern Queensland but are currently uneconomic to mine.  Australia's bauxite resources are assessed each year by Geoscience  Australia. The assessment is based on published and unpublished data. These  estimates are published each year in Australia’s  Identified Mineral Resources .

Travel writers at the New York Times asked readers to suggest the most amazing places around the world to visit.  Among the top suggestions readers came up with was Anne Hathaway’s Cottage in Shottery.  New York Times readers loved the timber framed thatched cottage, the birthplace of Shakespeare’s wife Anne Hathaway, and the Elizabethan style cottage gardens.  The paper’s website features a picture of the cottage taken through a circular willow sculpture in the garden.  Journalists describe the cottage as a must for all Shakespeare lovers.  The description says: About a mile from Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare’s birthplace, is the home of Anne Hathaway, his wife.  “This charming cottage where she grew up and was courted is a must for all Shakespeare fans.  “The cottage itself is a piece of history with many original pieces of furniture.  “The gardens are charming and often host art exhibits like this wicker sculpture by Tom Hare.”  The cottage appears alongside destinations with breathtaking natural scenery and exotic wildlife.  They include the Maasai Mara in Kenya, the USA’s Yosemite National Park and the Tongariro National Park in New Zealand.  The cottage is one of several buildings with links to Shakespeare managed by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.  Ruth Warner, head of visitor experience at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, said: “We’re delighted that readers of the New York Times have selected Anne Hathaway’s Cottage as one of the top places to go in 2016.  “Thousands of people from all over the world visit this picturesque cottage and gardens to discover the very place where Shakespeare courted his wife, and this year is an even more special reason to visit as we celebrate 400 years of Shakespeare’s legacy.  “We’ve planned a calendar of fun activities and events to mark this special anniversary year and look forward to welcoming visitors from near and far.”  A survey of visitors to Stratford in 2011 showed the town to be more popular with visitors from the USA than with visitors from any other foreign country.  But not all USA visitors find the beautiful sunshine of the New York Times picture.  A visitor from Atlanta, Georgia in the USA who toured the cottage this week declared in an internet review the house and gardens are beautiful.

College campuses across the world have worship chapels and historical cathedrals that entail a rich history along with brilliant architectural design. Though it proved to be a daunting task, we here at Best College Review have picked 30 cathedrals that we believe to be the most beautiful campus cathedrals in the world.  30. Perkins Chapel, Dallas, Texas  The Perkins Chapel has four white columns consistent with the 18th Century Georgian genre made famous by Christopher Wren. The chapel was constructed in the 1950’s and has since served as the main cathedral for the Perkins School of Theology and Southern Methodist University. The pews and furniture use 19th century influences including cherry colors with maple columns and Malaysian podouk carvings. Roman influences are also prevalent.  29. St. Thomas of Villanova Church, Villanova, Pennsylvania  The St. Thomas of Villanova Church is the official church of the Villanova University in Pennsylvania. The building was constructed in 1841 as a priest prep school for young Roman Catholic boys and eventually became the worship center for Villanova. The designer was a natural European, and his Germanic background showed through the architecture. The cathedral has two narrow towers over 60 feet tall. TThe interior of the church includes a 7-section dome, religious paintings, and marble columns.  28. Vassar Chapel, Poughkeepsie, New York  Vassar Chapel was constructed in 1904 and has not undergone sizable renovations, remaining largely in its original form. Vassar College uses it for special ceremonies every spring and fall semester. The building is available for rent and many people have used it for wedding ceremonies. Many celebrities like Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep have attended services at Vassar Chapel.  27. Chapel of the Resurrection, Valparaiso, Indiana  The Chapel of the Resurrection in Valparaiso, Indiana, is considered the biggest university-oriented cathedral in the U.S. and the second largest university cathedral in the world. Seating over 2,000 people at any given time, Valparaiso University finds that it accommodates all their needs. The building was constructed in the 1950’s with a 30-meter chancel, a 9-pointed apse, and a 59-foot nave. The building used over 7 million dollars to create many stained glass windows over 90 feet tall and an alter that reaches 20 feet across the front of the building. The church is officially Lutheran and only caters toward such denominational events.  26. Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen, Denmark  The Church of Our Lady is a cathedral that was completed in 1829. The original, built in 1178, was burned in a fire then partially rebuilt in the 14th Century. The final product that the students of the University of Copenhagen enjoy today was not complete until 1829. The design is neo-classical but includes other influences; for example, a bell was hung in its high tower in response to the public’s wishes. Part of the original walls still stand today. The large chapel seats over 100 and is decorated with statues of the apostles of Jesus Christ. Church of Our Lady’s Italian influence, with its carrara marble, is undeniable.  25. St. Paul’s Chapel, New York City, New York  St. Paul’s Chapel is the official cathedral for Columbia University. It was constructed in the early 20th Century using elaborate designs that borrowed from Byzantine, Gothic, and Renaissance structures. Three colorful windows designed by John La Farge line the foremost wall of the chapel. Today, the chapel is used daily by student groups at the university, and it is also a popular site for formal events in the community.  24.

That Klemzig is now in western Poland and is now known by the Polish name Klępsk. | Question: What type of place does Regency Road, Adelaide and Klemzig, South Australia have in common?', ['city'], 'mrqa_hotpotqa-validation-3785'), ('Context: do all quadrilaterals have parallel sides - Eduritedo all quadrilaterals have parallel sides  Best Results From Wikipedia  Yahoo Answers  Youtube  From Wikipedia  Quadrilateral  In Euclidean plane geometry , a quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides (or \'edges\') and four vertices or corners. Sometimes, the term quadrangle is used, by analogy with triangle , and sometimes tetragon for consistency with pentagon (5-sided), hexagon (6-sided) and so on. The word quadrilateral is made of the words quad (meaning "four") and lateral (meaning "of sides").  Quadrilaterals are simple (not self-intersecting) or complex (self-intersecting), also called crossed. Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave .  The interior angles of a simple quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees of arc . In a crossed quadrilateral, the interior angles on either side of the crossing add up to 720Â°.  All convex quadrilaterals tile the plane by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.  Convex quadrilaterals - parallelograms  A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Equivalent conditions are that opposite sides are of equal length; that opposite angles are equal; or that the diagonals bisect each other. Parallelograms also include the square, rectangle, rhombus and rhomboid.  Rhombus or rhomb: all four sides are of equal length. Equivalent conditions are that opposite sides are parallel and opposite angles are equal, or that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other. An informal description is "a pushed-over square" (including a square).  Rhomboid : a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths and angles are oblique (not right angles). Informally: "a pushed-over rectangle with no right angles."  Rectangle : all four angles are right angles. An equivalent condition is that the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length. Informally: "a box or oblong" (including a square).  Square (regular quadrilateral): all four sides are of equal length (equilateral), and all four angles are right angles. An equivalent condition is that opposite sides are parallel (a square is a parallelogram), that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other, and are of equal length. A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is both a rhombus and a rectangle.  Oblong : a term sometimes used to denote a rectangle which has unequal adjacent sides (i.e. a rectangle that is not a square).  A shape that is both a rhombus (four equal sides) and a rectangle (four equal angles) is a square (four equal sides and four equal angles).  Convex quadrilaterals - other  Kite : two pairs of adjacent sides are of equal length. This implies that one diagonal divides the kite into congruent triangles , and so the angles between the two pairs of equal sides are equal in measure. It also implies that the diagonals are perpendicular. (It is common, especially in the discussions on plane tessellations , to refer to the concave quadrilateral with these properties as a dart or arrowhead, with term kite being restricted to the convex shape.)  Trapezium ( British English ) or trapezoid (NAm.): one pair of opposite sides are parallel .  Isosceles trapezium (Brit.) or isosceles trapezoid (NAm.): one pair of opposite sides are parallel and the base angle s are equal in measure. This implies that the other two sides are of equal length, and that the diagonals are of equal length. An alternative definition is: "a quadrilateral with an axis of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides".  Trapezium (NAm.): no sides are parallel. (In British English this would be called an irregular quadrilateral, and was once called a trapezoid .)  Cyclic quadrilateral : the four vertices lie on a circumscribed circle. A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if opposite angles sum to 180Â°.  Tangential quadrilateral : the four edges are tangential to an inscribed circle. Another term for a tangential polygon is inscriptible.  Bicentric quadrilateral: both cyclic and tangential.

Certain relatives are not allowed to marry . For foreign nationals , there are also residency conditions that have to be met before people can be married . Same - sex marriage was introduced under the Marriage ( Same Sex Couples ) Act in March 2014 . Prior to this , civil partnerships had been made available to same - sex couples in the United Kingdom in 2005 , granting rights and responsibilities virtually identical to civil marriage . Civil partnerships remain to be available to only same - sex couples , despite a call by Peter Tatchell for there to be an equal status regarding such civil unions .
